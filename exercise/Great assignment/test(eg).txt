[0]501 Lionfish 11/Nov/2007     Chapter One     The Worst BirthdayContents   Next Chapter
[1]791    Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive
[2]372    Mr
[3]11458    Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew Harry's room
[4]611   Third time this week
[5]253   he roared across the table
[6]3011    If you can't control that owl, it'll have to go
[7]5898  Harry tried, yet again, to explain
[8]9855   She's bored , he said
[9]5019    She's used to flying around outside
[10]1846    If I could just let her out at night-Do I look stupid
[11]587   snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache
[12]6558    I know what'll happen if that owl's let out
[13]546   He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia
[14]6697   Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys' son, Dudley
[15]346   I want more bacon
[16]10698   There's more in the frying pan, sweetums, said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son
[17]11164    We must build you up while we've got the chance I don't like the sound of that school foodNonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings, said Uncle Vernon heartily
[18]3158    Dudley gets enough, don't you, son
[19]6648  Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry
[20]36   Pass the frying pan
[21]11866   You've forgotten the magic word, said Harry irritably
[22]1231   The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs
[23]1163    Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth; Mr
[24]321    Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his temples
[25]46   I meant please'
[26]10973   said Harry quickly
[27]4482    I didn't mean-WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU, thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table, ABOUT SAYING THE M'WORD IN OUR HOUSE
[28]183  But I-HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY
[29]598   roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist
[30]834   I just-I WARNED YOU
[31]52   I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF
[32]6883  Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet
[33]19025   All right, said Harry,  all rightUncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes
[34]16467   Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry Potter wasn't a normal boy
[35]230    As a matter of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be
[36]7182   Harry Potter was a wizard - a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
[37]6125    And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry felt
[38]1111   He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache
[39]3049    He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks)
[40]17886   All Harry's spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home
[41]9717    What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he hadn't practiced all summer
[42]6297   What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done
[43]1158   The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame
[44]11509    Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry's owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world
[45]7326   Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family
[46]1307    Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky
[47]7268    Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy
[48]369    He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar
[49]6019   It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard
[50]11305    This scar was the only hint of Harry's very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys'doorstep eleven years before
[51]7607   At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak
[52]32380    Harry's parents had died in Voldemort's attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow - nobody understood why -Voldemort's powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry
[53]10723   So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother's sister and her husband
[54]1921    He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys'story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents
[55]6868   And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had come out
[56]7821    Harry had taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his scar were famous but now the school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly
[57]13230   The Dursleys hadn't even remembered that today happened to be Harry's twelfth birthday
[58]10658    Of course, his hopes hadn't been high; they'd never given him a real present, let alone a cake - but to ignore it completelyAt that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said, Now, as we all know, today is a very important day
[59]6565   Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it
[60]5821   This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, said Uncle Vernon
[61]5946   Harry went back to his toast
[62]1227    Of course , he thought bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party 
[63]802    He'd been talking of nothing else for two weeks
[64]5800    Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him (Uncle Vernon's company made drills)
[65]6591   I think we should run through the schedule one more time, said Uncle Vernon
[66]187    We should all be in position at eight o'clock
[67]100    Petunia, you will be -
[68]5497  In the lounge, said Aunt Petunia promptly, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home
[69]686   Good, good
[70]156    And Dudley
[71]1394  I'll be waiting to open the door
[72]281    Dudley put on a foul, simpering smile
[73]376    May I take your coats, Mr
[74]369    and Mrs
[75]10    Mason
[76]587  They'll love him
[77]246   cried Aunt Petunia rapturously
[78]5588   Excellent, Dudley, said Uncle Vernon
[79]5745    Then he rounded on Harry
[80]0    And you
[81]12071  I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I'm not there, said Harry tonelessly
[82]5505   Exactly, said Uncle Vernon nastily
[83]137    I will lead them into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them drinks
[84]5922    At eight-fifteen-I'll announce dinner, said Aunt Petunia
[85]1814   And, Dudley, you'll say-May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs
[86]10    Mason
[87]5480   said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman
[88]306   My perfect little gentleman
[89]211   sniffed Aunt Petunia
[90]0   And you
[91]11134   said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry
[92]12492   I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there, said Harry dully
[93]9   Precisely
[94]418    Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner
[95]107    Petunia, any ideas
[96]558  Vernon tells me you're a wonderful golfer, Mr
[97]738    Mason Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs
[98]157    MasonPerfect Dudley
[99]674  How about - 'We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr
[100]33    Mason, and I wrote about you 
[101]5937   'This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry
[102]8804    Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn't see him laughing
[103]132   And you, boy
[104]6404  Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged
[105]6738   I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there, he said
[106]557   Too right, you will
[107]5411    said Uncle Vernon forcefully
[108]9381    The Masons don't know anything about you and it's going to stay that way
[109]5181    When dinner's over, you take Mrs
[110]771    Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I'll bring the subject around to drills
[111]726    With any luck, I'll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten
[112]646    be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time to morrow
[113]8307   Harry couldn't feel too excited about this
[114]4998    He didn't think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive
[115]1246   Right - I'm off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and me
[116]5769    And you , he snarled at Harry
[117]10046    You stay out of your aunt's way while she's cleaning
[118]6505   Harry left through the back door
[119]191    It was a brilliant, sunny day
[120]500    He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his breath:Happy birthday to me happy birthday to meNo cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist
[121]61    He gazed miserably into the hedge
[122]283    He had never felt so lonely
[123]10639    More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger
[124]2726    They, however, didn't seem to be missing him at all
[125]14029    Neither of them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay
[126]17197   Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk
[127]3190    Underage wizards weren't allowed to use magic outside of school
[128]9584    Harry hadn't told the Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick
[129]7052    For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him
[130]14006    But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal - and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday
[131]2692   What wouldn't he give now for a message from Hogwarts
[132]231   From any witch or wizard
[133]5134   He'd almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn't all been a dreamNot that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun
[134]7788    At the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself
[135]341    Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power
[136]25345    Harry had slipped through Voldemort's clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes-Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench
[137]386    He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge - and the hedge was staring back 
[138]727    Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves
[139]7415   Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn
[140]1095   I know what day it is, sang Dudley, waddling toward him
[141]587   The huge eyes blinked and vanished
[142]0   What
[143]11452   said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been
[144]1804   I know what day it is, Dudley repeated, coming right up to him
[145]10818   Well done, said Harry
[146]905    So you've finally learned the days of the week
[147]4997   Today's your birthday , sneered Dudley
[148]3576    How come you haven't got any cards
[149]3376   Haven't you even got friends at that freak place
[150]11984  Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school, said Harry coolly
[151]213   Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom
[152]187   Why're you staring at the hedge
[153]5097   he said suspiciously
[154]11802   I'm trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire, said Harry
[155]1216   Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face
[156]15621   You c-can't - Dad told you you're not to do m-magic - he said he'll chuck you out of the house - and you haven't got anywhere else to go - you haven't got any friends to take you-Jiggery pokery
[157]11360   said Harry in a fierce voice
[158]5     Hocus pocus - squiggly wiggly - MUUUUUUM
[159]650   howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house
[160]1    MUUUUM
[161]5703   He's doing you know what
[162]6029  Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun
[163]4537    As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan
[164]3485    Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished
[165]6349   While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench
[166]142    The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck
[167]34605    Harry knew he shouldn't have risen to Dudley's bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself maybe he didn't have any friends at HogwartsWish they could see famous Harry Potter now , he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face
[168]969   It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him
[169]0   Get in here
[170]72   And walk on the newspaper
[171]5941  Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen
[172]5032    On top of the fridge stood tonight's pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets
[173]13    A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven
[174]177   Eat quickly
[175]78   The Masons will be here soon
[176]662   snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table
[177]138    She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress
[178]5927   Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper
[179]916    The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate
[180]42    Upstairs
[181]36   Hurry
[182]7487  As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets
[183]7451    He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the door bell rang and Uncle Vernon's furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs
[184]7501   Remember, boy - one sound-Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on his bed
[185]193    The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it

[192]11752    Lionfish 11/Nov/2007     Chapter Two     Dobby's WarningContents  Prev Chapter  Next Chapter Harry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing
[193]2176    The little creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls
[194]6295    Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning
[195]11771   As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley's voice from the hall
[196]376   May I take your coats, Mr
[197]369    and Mrs
[198]10    Mason
[199]1067  The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet
[200]7634    Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes
[201]11016   Er - hello, said Harry nervously
[202]6193   Harry Potter
[203]11841   said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs
[204]12569    So long has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir Such an honor it isTh-thank you, said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage
[205]283    He wanted to ask, What are you
[206]5657   but thought it would sound too rude, so instead he said, Who are you
[207]354  Dobby, sir
[208]1019    Just Dobby
[209]5635    Dobby the house-elf, said the creature
[210]650   Oh - really
[211]10818   said Harry
[212]6985    Er - I don't want to be rude or anything, but - this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom
[213]809   Aunt Petunias high, false laugh sounded from the living room
[214]622    The elf hung his head
[215]11697   Not that I'm not pleased to meet you, said Harry quickly, but, er, is there any particular reason you're here
[216]6103  Oh, yes, sir, said Dobby earnestly
[217]12632    Dobby has come to tell you, sir it is difficult, sir Dobby wonders where to beginSit down, said Harry politely, pointing at the bed
[218]291   To his horror, the elf burst into tears - very noisy tears
[219]4793   S-sit down
[220]5   he wailed
[221]737     Never  never everHarry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter
[222]3817   I'm sorry, he whispered, I didn't mean to offend you or anything-Offend Dobby
[223]110   choked the elf
[224]7738    Dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard - like an equal-Harry, trying to say Shh
[225]3142   and look comforting at the same time, ushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly doll
[226]6801    At last he managed to control himself, and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration
[227]13552   You can't have met many decent wizards, said Harry, trying to cheer him up
[228]767   Dobby shook his head
[229]1237    Then, without warning, he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window, shouting,  Bad Dobby
[230]303   Bad Dobby
[231]3123  Don't - what are you doing
[232]6577   Harry hissed, springing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed - Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage
[233]5875   Dobby had to punish himself, sir, said the elf, who had gone slightly cross-eyed
[234]447    Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sirYour family
[235]2200  The wizard family Dobby serves, sir Dobby is a house-elf - bound to serve one house and one family foreverDo they know you're here
[236]6104   asked Harry curiously
[237]220   Dobby shuddered
[238]975   Oh, no, sir, no Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you, sir
[239]908    Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this
[240]3594    If they ever knew, sir-But won't they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door
[241]355  Dobby doubts it, sir
[242]465    Dobby is always having to punish himself for something, sir
[243]360    They lets Dobby get on with it, sir
[244]3090    Sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishmentsBut why don't you leave
[245]29   Escape
[246]647  A house-elf must be set free, sir
[247]905    And the family will never set Dobby free Dobby will serve the family until he dies, sirHarry stared
[248]5621   And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks, he said
[249]237    This makes the Dursleys sound almost human
[250]2453    Can't anyone help you
[251]2308   Can't I
[252]8183  Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn't spoken
[253]223    Dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude
[254]5914   Please, Harry whispered frantically, please be quiet
[255]15282    If the Dursleys hear anything, if they know you're here-Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knewHarry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, Whatever you've heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish
[256]9218    I'm not even top of my year at Hogwarts; that's Hermione, she-But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful
[257]12718   Harry Potter is humble and modest, said Dobby reverently, his orb-like eyes aglow
[258]6460    Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named-Voldemort
[259]10818   said Harry
[260]793   Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, Ah, speak not the name, sir
[261]76   Speak not the name
[262]11068  Sorry, said Harry quickly
[263]4762    I know lots of people don't like it
[264]2183    My friend Ron-He stopped again
[265]2106    Thinking about Ron was painful, too
[266]6537   Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights
[267]20424   Dobby heard tell, he said hoarsely, that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time just weeks ago that Harry Potter escaped yet again 
[268]11388   Harry nodded and Dobby's eyes suddenly shone with tears
[269]940   Ah, sir, he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing
[270]6198    Harry Potter is valiant and bold
[271]5   He has braved so many dangers already
[272]14204   But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts 
[273]5798   There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon's voice
[274]18   W-what
[275]5738   Harry stammered
[276]1436    But I've got to go back - term starts on September first
[277]10030    It's all that's keeping me going
[278]9196    You don't know what it's like here
[279]2955    I don't belong here
[280]312    I belong in your world - at Hogwarts
[281]1075   No, no, no, squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears flapped
[282]6295    Harry Potter must stay where he is safe
[283]612    He is too great, too good, to lose
[284]6476    If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal danger
[285]0   Why
[286]10859   said Harry in surprise
[287]6195   There is a plot, Harry Potter
[288]1568    A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year, whispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over
[289]444    Dobby has known it for months, sir
[290]6196    Harry Potter must not put himself in peril
[291]193    He is too important, sir
[292]173  What terrible things
[293]10818   said Harry at once
[294]4755    Who's plotting them
[295]994  Dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall
[296]557   All right
[297]10871   cried Harry, grabbing the elf's arm to stop him
[298]2640    You can't tell me
[299]88    I understand
[300]29    But why are you warning me
[301]451   A sudden, unpleasant thought struck him
[302]3942    Hang on - this hasn't got anything to do with Vol- - sorry - with You-Know-Who, has it
[303]6662   You could just shake or nod, he added hastily as Dobby's head tilted worryingly close to the wall again
[304]893   Slowly, Dobby shook his head
[305]11654   Not - not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named , sir-But Dobby's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a hint
[306]5854    Harry, however, was completely lost
[307]3077   He hasn't got a brother, has he
[308]1256  Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever
[309]14324   Well then, I can't think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts, said Harry
[310]10512    I mean, there's Dumbledore, for one thing - you know who Dumbledore is, don't you
[311]714  Dobby bowed his head
[312]1150   Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had
[313]419    Dobby knows it, sir
[314]6118    Dobby has heard Dumbledore's powers rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength
[315]26637    But, sir - Dobby's voice dropped to an urgent whisper - there are powers Dumbledore doesn't powers no decent wizardAnd before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed, seized Harry's desk lamp, and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps
[316]285   A sudden silence fell downstairs
[317]7678    Two seconds later Harry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling, Dudley must have left his television on again, the little tyke
[318]41  Quick
[319]6   In the closet
[320]8314   hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting the door, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned
[321]190   What - the - devil - are - you - doing
[322]16580   said Uncle Vernon through gritted teeth, his face horribly close to Harry's
[323]3090    You've just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy
[324]479  He stomped flat-footed from the room
[325]6365   Shaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet
[326]5484   See what it's like here
[327]5086   he said
[328]1623    See why I've got to go back to Hogwarts
[329]8321   It's the only place I've got - well, I think I've got friends
[330]9229   Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter
[331]5300   said Dobby slyly
[332]12531   I expect they've just been - wait a minute, said Harry, frowning
[333]3317    How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me
[334]466  Dobby shuffled his feet
[335]8786   Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby
[336]1026    Dobby did it for the best-Have you been stopping my letters
[337]5538   Dobby has them here, sir, said the elf
[338]10978    Stepping nimbly out of Harry's reach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing
[339]20696    Harry could make out Hermione's neat writing, Ron's untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid
[340]5992   Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry
[341]24751   Harry Potter mustn't be angry Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sirHarry wasn't listening
[342]332    He made a grab for the letters, but Dobby jumped out of reach
[343]6927   Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his word that he will not return to Hogwarts
[344]744    Ah, sir, this is a danger you must not face
[345]2857   Say you won't go back, sir
[346]10901  No, said Harry angrily
[347]97    Give me my friends'letters
[348]11647  Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice, said the elf sadly
[349]7006   Before Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the bedroom door, pulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs
[350]6551   Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying not to make a sound
[351]1181    He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking around for Dobby
[352]2061    From the dining room he heard Uncle Vernon saying,  tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers, Mr
[353]10    Mason
[354]5464    She's been dying to hearHarry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear
[355]5122   Aunt Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling
[356]347    On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby
[357]5748   No, croaked Harry
[358]10412    Please they'll kill meHarry Potter must say he's not going back to school-Dobby pleaseSay it, sir-I can't-Dobby gave him a tragic look
[359]11640   Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good
[360]567   The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash
[361]154    Cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered
[362]1045    With a crack like a whip, Dobby vanished
[363]12294   There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunia's pudding
[364]1183   At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over
[365]7703    ("Just our nephew -very disturbed - meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs") He shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop
[366]6279    Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean
[367]3193   Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal - if it hadn't been for the owl
[368]2445   Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a letter on Mrs
[369]5269    Mason's head, and swooped out again
[370]369    Mrs
[371]1089    Mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics
[372]372    Mr
[373]1917    Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke
[374]6906   Harry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes
[375]128   Read it
[376]231   he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered
[377]128    Go on - read it
[378]5944  Harry took it
[379]688    It did not contain birthday greetings
[380]462   Dear Mr
[381]1155    Potter,We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine
[382]6659   As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school
[383]108    (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C)
[384]643   We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non magical community (Muggles) is a serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks'Statute of Secrecy
[385]45   Enjoy your holidays
[386]1108  Yours sincerely,Mafalda HopkirkIMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICEMinistry of MagicHarry looked up from the letter and gulped
[387]12095   You didn't tell us you weren't allowed to use magic outside school, said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes
[388]7041    Forgot to mention it Slipped your mind, I daresayHe was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth bared
[389]3602    Well, I've got news for you, boy I'm locking you up You're never going back to that school never and if you try and magic yourself out - they'll expel you
[390]6591  And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs
[391]482   Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word
[392]10960    The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry's window
[393]1255    He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day
[394]6367    They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening
[395]520    Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock
[396]8909   Three days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, and Harry couldn't see any way out of his situation
[397]1224    He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him
[398]1222   What was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it
[399]925   Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low
[400]3329    Now that the Dursleys knew they weren't going to wake up as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon
[401]8101    Dobby might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were going, he'd probably starve to death anyway
[402]1094   The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room
[403]6056    Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it
[404]412    The soup was stone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp
[405]5430    Then he crossed the room to Hedwig's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray
[406]794    She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust
[407]22182   It's no good turning your beak up at it - that's all we've got, said Harry grimly
[408]595   He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup
[409]3249   Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks, hat would happen if he didn't turn up at Hogwarts
[410]2922   Would someone be sent to see why he hadn't come back
[411]722   Would they be able to make the Dursleys let him go
[412]794  The room was growing dark
[413]6227    Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into an uneasy sleep
[414]286   He dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card reading UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage
[415]616    People goggled through the bars at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw
[416]12907    He saw Dobby's face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but Dobby called, Harry Potter is safe there, sir
[417]58   and vanished
[418]435    Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at him
[419]6484   Stop it, Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head
[420]1489    Leave me alone cut it out I'm trying to sleepHe opened his eyes
[421]220    Moonlight was shining through the bars on the window
[422]529    And someone was goggling through the bars at him: a freckle-faced, red-haired, long-nosed someone
[423]13409   Ron Weasley was outside Harry's window

[434]2697    Lionfish 11/Nov/2007     Chapter Three     The BurrowContents  Prev Chapter  Next Chapter  Ron
[435]6081    breathed Harry, creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars
[436]2669    Ron, how did you -
[437]0   What the -
[438]11199  Harry's mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him
[439]2531    Ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car, which was parked in midair 
[440]13381    Grinning at Harry from the front seats were Fred and George, Ron's elder twin brothers
[441]6289   All right, Harry
[442]734   asked George
[443]5239   What's been going on
[444]7088   said Ron
[445]2486    Why haven't you been answering my letters
[446]12212   I've asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said you'd got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles-It wasn't me - and how did he know
[447]7321  He works for the Ministry, said Ron
[448]12513    You know we're not supposed to do spells outside school-You should talk, said Harry, staring at the floating car
[449]9885   Oh, this doesn't count, said Ron
[450]1    We're only borrowing this
[451]12321    It's Dad's, we didn't enchant it
[452]25669    But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with-I told you, I didn't - but it'll take too long to explain now - look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won't let me come back, and obviously I can't magic myself out, because the Ministry'll think that's the second spell I've done in three days, so-Stop gibbering, said Ron
[453]1207    We've come to take you home with us
[454]13334   But you can't magic me out either-We don't need to, said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning
[455]1407    You forget who I've got with me
[456]11529   Tie that around the bars, said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to Harry
[457]12070   If the Dursleys wake up, I'm dead, said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car
[458]8567   Don't worry, said Fred, and stand back
[459]6146   Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent
[460]1416    The car revved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air
[461]6342    Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground
[462]2148    Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car
[463]6002    Harry listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the Dursleys'bedroom
[464]13292   When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry's window
[465]7088   Get in, Ron said
[466]745   But all my Hogwarts stuff - my wand - my broomstick-Where is it
[467]8440  Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can't get out of this room-No problem, said George from the front passenger seat
[468]6087    Out of the way, Harry
[469]11927   Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry's room
[470]7282    You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock
[471]12179   A lot of wizards think it's a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle trick, said Fred, but we feel they're skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow
[472]940   There was a small click and the door swung open
[473]4134   So - we'll get your trunk - you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ron, whispered George
[474]6351   Watch out for the bottom stair - it creaks, Harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing
[475]8527   Harry dashed around his room, collecting his things and passing them out of the window to Ron
[476]1297    Then he went to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the stairs
[477]6328    Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough
[478]11610   At last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk through Harry's room to the open window
[479]8801    Fred climbed back into the car to pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side
[480]342    Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window
[481]317   Uncle Vernon coughed again
[482]1024   A bit more, panted Fred, who was pulling from inside the car
[483]7025    One good push-Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car
[484]5593   Okay, let's go, George whispered
[485]11884   But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon's voice
[486]115   THAT RUDDY OWL
[487]818  I've forgotten Hedwig
[488]13562  Harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on - he snatched up Hedwig's cage, dashed to the window, and passed it out to Ron
[489]1134    He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door - and it crashed open
[490]7587   For a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry, grabbing him by the ankle
[491]13776   Ron, Fred, and George seized Harry's arms and pulled as hard as they could
[492]100   Petunia
[493]358   roared Uncle Vernon
[494]5207    He's getting away
[495]5207   HE'S GETTING AWAY
[496]23523  But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry's leg slid out of Uncle Vernon's grasp - Harry was in the car - he'd slammed the door shut-Put your foot down, Fred
[497]2372   yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly toward the moon
[498]8330   Harry couldn't believe it - he was free
[499]1468    He rolled down the window, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive
[500]11360    Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry's window
[501]64   See you next summer
[502]5811   Harry yelled
[503]6129   The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat, grinning from ear to ear
[504]2728   Let Hedwig out, he told Ron
[505]40    She can fly behind us
[506]2476    She hasn't had a chance to stretch her wings for ages
[507]3854   George handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment later, Hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost
[508]10545   So - what's the story, Harry
[509]7133   said Ron impatiently
[510]4784    What's been happening
[511]12748  Harry told them all about Dobby, the warning he'd given Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding
[512]532    There was a long, shocked silence when he had finished
[513]5576   Very fishy, said Fred finally
[514]429   Definitely dodgy agreed George
[515]7670    So he wouldn't even tell you who's supposed to be plotting all this stuff
[516]14321  I don't think he could, said Harry
[517]2451    I told you, every time he got close to letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall
[518]1589   He saw Fred and George look at each other
[519]645   What, you think he was lying to me
[520]10818   said Harry
[521]14279   Well, said Fred, put it this way - house-elves have got powerful magic of their own, but they can't usually use it without their master's permission
[522]1007    I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back to Hogwarts
[523]4892    Someone's idea of a joke
[524]788    Can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you
[525]13122  Yes, said Harry and Ron together, instantly
[526]6254   Draco Malfoy, Harry explained
[527]6    He hates me
[528]501   Draco Malfoy
[529]5552   said George, turning around
[530]5284    Not Lucius Malfoy's son
[531]4850  Must be, it's not a very common name, is it
[532]10818   said Harry
[533]6682   I've heard Dad talking about him, said George
[534]830    He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who
[535]14009   And when You-Know-Who disappeared, said Fred, craning around to look at Harry, Lucius Malfoy came back saying he'd never meant any of it
[536]6244    Load of dung - Dad reckons he was right in You- Know-Who's inner circle
[537]14022   Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy's family before, and they didn't surprise him at all
[538]16737    Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boyI don't know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf said Harry
[539]6391   Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they'll be rich, said Fred
[540]10895   Yeah, Mum's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing, said George
[541]1626    But all we've got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden
[542]4189    House-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that; you wouldn't catch one in our houseHarry was silent
[543]2707    Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house
[544]8280    Sending the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do
[545]6047    Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously
[546]7778  I'm glad we came to get you, anyway, said Ron
[547]3266    I was getting really worried when you didn't answer any of my letters
[548]9933    I thought it was Errol's fault at first-Who's Errol
[549]103  Our owl
[550]4778    He's ancient
[551]3611    It wouldn't be the first time he'd collapsed on a delivery
[552]137    So then I tried to borrow Hermes-Who
[553]6008  The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect, said Fred from the front
[554]9637   But Percy wouldn't lend him to me, said Ron
[555]5122    Said he needed him
[556]10477   Percy's been acting very oddly this summer, said George, frowning
[557]7203    And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room I mean, there's only so many times you can polish a prefect badge You're driving too far west, Fred, he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard
[558]443    Fred twiddled the steering wheel
[559]2468   So, does your dad know you've got the car
[560]10895   said Harry, guessing the answer
[561]7356   Er, no, said Ron, he had to work tonight
[562]871    Hopefully we'll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it
[563]631   What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway
[564]7178  He works in the most boring department, said Ron
[565]276    The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office
[566]0   The what
[567]6382  It's all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made, you know, in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house
[568]1453    Like, last year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop
[569]695    This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serve her friends tea in it
[570]191    It was a nightmare - Dad was working overtime for weeks
[571]143   What happened
[572]762  The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose
[573]6751    Dad was going frantic - it's only him and an old warlock called Perkins in the office - and they had to do Memory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up-But your dad - this car-Fred laughed
[574]10113    Yeah, Dad's crazy about everything to do with Muggles; our shed's full of Muggle stuff
[575]103    He takes it apart, puts spells on it, and puts it back together again
[576]843    If he raided our house he'd have to put himself under arrest
[577]168    It drives Mum mad
[578]10277   That's the main road, said George, peering down through the windshield
[579]6416    We'll be there in ten minutes Just as well, it's getting lightA faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east
[580]7052   Fred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees
[581]6246   We're a little way outside the village, said George
[582]41    Ottery St
[583]1    Catchpole
[584]428   Lower and lower went the flying car
[585]290    The edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees
[586]1   Touchdown
[587]5747   said Fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground
[588]14125    They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and Harry looked out for the first time at Ron's house
[589]8042   It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which Harry reminded himself, it probably was)
[590]119    Four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof
[591]482    A lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read, THE BURROW 
[592]636    Around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron
[593]432    Several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard
[594]11838   It's not much, said Ron
[595]15793   It's wonderful , said Harry happily, thinking of Privet Drive
[596]805   They got out of the car
[597]10771   Now, we'll go upstairs really quietly, said Fred, and wait for Mum to call us for breakfast Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going, Mum, look who turned up in the night
[598]7488  'and she'll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car
[599]7645   Right, said Ron
[600]9103    Come on, Harry, I sleep at the - at the top-Ron had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house
[601]16    The other three wheeled around
[602]369   Mrs
[603]2337    Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, and for a short, plump, kind-faced woman, it was remarkable how much she looked like a saber-toothed tiger
[604]5565   Ah , said Fred
[605]5916   Oh, dear, said George
[606]369   Mrs
[607]1781    Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips, staring from one guilty face to the next
[608]552    She was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket
[609]5086   So , she said
[610]6651   Morning, Mum, said George, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty, winning voice
[611]851   Have you any idea how worried I've been
[612]5455   said Mrs
[613]677    Weasley in a deadly whisper
[614]543   Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to-All three of Mrs
[615]5479    Weasley's sons were taller than she was, but they cowered as her rage broke over them
[616]18   Beds empty
[617]56   No note
[618]1192   Car gone - could have crashed - out of my mind with worry - did you care
[619]2942   - never, as long as I've lived - you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy -Perfect Percy, muttered Fred
[620]5077   YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY'S BOOK
[621]448   yelled Mrs
[622]5911    Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred's chest
[623]492    You could have died , you could have been seen , you could have lost your father his job-It seemed to go on for hours
[624]369    Mrs
[625]7215    Weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away
[626]11408   I'm very pleased to see you, Harry, dear, she said
[627]483    Come in and have some breakfast
[628]8679   She turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her
[629]237   The kitchen was small and rather cramped
[630]6903    There was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat, looking around
[631]359    He had never been in a wizard house before
[632]599   The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all
[633]2357    Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time to feed the chickens , and You're late 
[634]6046    Books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese, Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts - It's Magic
[635]11853   And unless Harry's ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was Witching Hour, with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina Warbeck
[636]369   Mrs
[637]1230    Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan
[638]4797    Every now and then she muttered things like don't know what you were thinking of, and  never would have believed it
[639]8831   I don't blame you , dear, she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate
[640]113    Arthur and I have been worried about you, too
[641]6622    Just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves if you hadn't written back to Ron by Friday
[642]1417    But really, (she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate) flying an illegal car halfway across the country - anyone could have seen you-She flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began to clean themselves, clinking gently in the background
[643]82   It was cloudy , Mum
[644]5514   said Fred
[645]310   You keep your mouth closed while you're eating
[646]369   Mrs
[647]687    Weasley snapped
[648]86   They were starving him, Mum
[649]5464   said George
[650]0   And you
[651]5455   said Mrs
[652]6734    Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for him
[653]1450   At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small, redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran out again
[654]13165   Ginny, said Ron in an undertone to Harry
[655]14    My sister
[656]4958    She's been talking about you all summer
[657]17895   Yeah, she'll be wanting your autograph, Harry, Fred said with a grin, but he caught his mother's eye and bent his face over his plate without another word
[658]5963    Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean, which took a surprisingly short time
[659]967   Blimey , I'm tired, yawned Fred, setting down his knife and fork at last
[660]1726    I think I'll go to bed and-You will not, snapped Mrs
[661]636    Weasley
[662]5660    It's your own fault you've been up all night
[663]9027    You're going to de-gnome the garden for me; they're getting completely out of hand again-Oh, Mum-And you two, she said, glaring at Ron and Fred
[664]6093    You can go up to bed, dear, she added to Harry
[665]17040    You didn't ask them to fly that wretched car-But Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, I'll help Ron
[666]16069    I've never seen a de-gnoming-That's very sweet of you, dear, but it's dull work, said Mrs
[667]636    Weasley
[668]11342    Now, let's see what Lockhart's got to say on the subject-And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece
[669]395    George groaned
[670]7696   Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden-Harry looked at the cover of Mrs
[671]5460    Weasley's book
[672]5262    Written across it in fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to Household Pests 
[673]1936    There was a big photograph on the front of a very good-looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes
[674]6552    As always in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at them all
[675]369    Mrs
[676]655    Weasley beamed down at him
[677]5449   Oh, he is marvelous, she said
[678]10966    He knows his household pests, all right, it's a wonderful bookMum fancies him, said Fred, in a very audible whisper
[679]8835   Don't be so ridiculous, Fred, said Mrs
[680]694    Weasley, her cheeks rather pink
[681]7539    All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there's a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it
[682]5923   Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry behind them
[683]11322    The garden was large, and in Harry's eyes, exactly what a garden should be
[684]9020    The Dursleys wouldn't have liked it - there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting - but there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs
[685]8969   Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know, Harry told Ron they crossed the lawn
[686]12714   Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes, said Ron, bent double with his head in a peony bush, like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rodsThere was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and Ron straightened up
[687]5124     This is a gnome, he said grimly
[688]5   Gerroff me
[689]5   Gerroff me
[690]19   squealed the gnome
[691]772   It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus
[692]2313    It was small and leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato
[693]7872    Ron held it at arm's length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down
[694]5086   This is what you have to do, he said
[695]626    He raised the gnome above his head ("Gerroff me
[696]1120  ") and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso
[697]21474    Seeing the shocked look on Harry's face, Ron added, It doesn't hurt them -you've just got to make them really dizzy so they can't find their way back to the gnome holes
[698]5638   He let go of the gnome's ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge
[699]5518   Pitiful, said Fred
[700]44    I bet I can get mine beyond that stump
[701]6139   Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes
[702]18722    He decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry's finger and he had a hard job shaking it off - until-Wow, Harry - that must've been fifty feetThe air was soon thick with flying gnomes
[703]5537   See, they're not too bright, said George, seizing five or six gnomes at once
[704]6744    The moment they know the de-gnoming's going on they storm up to have a look
[705]2705    You'd think they'd have learned by now just to stay put
[706]1090   Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line, their little shoulders hunched
[707]7792   They'll be back, said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field
[708]5488    They love it here Dad's too soft with them; he thinks they're funnyJust then, the front door slammed
[709]4750   He's back
[710]5464   said George
[711]4938    Dad's home
[712]309  They hurried through the garden and back into the house
[713]372   Mr
[714]1496    Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed
[715]5933    He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children's
[716]700    He was wearing long green robes, which were dusty and travel-worn
[717]356   What a night, he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him
[718]3    Nine raids
[719]0    Nine
[720]389   And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turnedMr
[721]1281    Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed
[722]110   Find anything, Dad
[723]5565   said Fred eagerly
[724]1600   All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle, yawned Mr
[725]636    Weasley
[726]2646    There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn't my department, though
[727]5975    Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets, but that's the Committee on Experimental Charms, thank goodnessWhy would anyone bother making door keys shrink
[728]5464   said George
[729]1311   Just Muggle-baiting, sighed Mr
[730]636    Weasley
[731]6900    Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it Of course, it's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking - they'll insist they just keep losing it
[732]9841    Bless them, they'll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if it's staring them in the face But the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn't believe-LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE
[733]369  Mrs
[734]1924    Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword
[735]372    Mr
[736]6125    Weasley's eyes jerked open
[737]148    He stared guiltily at his wife
[738]184   C-cars, Molly, dear
[739]5828  Yes, Arthur, cars, said Mrs
[740]1124    Weasley, her eyes flashing
[741]1373    Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was enchanting it to make it fly 
[742]372   Mr
[743]650    Weasley blinked
[744]14133   Well, dear, I think you'll find that he would be quite within the law to do that, even if - er - he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth There's a loophole in the law, you'll find As long as he wasn't intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn't-Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law
[745]504   shouted Mrs
[746]636    Weasley
[747]962    Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed
[748]8452   And for your information, Harry arrived this morning in the car you weren't intending to fly
[749]5732  Harry
[750]5458   said Mr
[751]658    Weasley blankly
[752]5732    Harry who
[753]6779  He looked around, saw Harry, and jumped
[754]6623   Good lord, is it Harry Potter
[755]18253   Very pleased to meet you, Ron's told us so much about-Your sons flew that car to Harry's house and back last night
[756]504   shouted Mrs
[757]636    Weasley
[758]988    What have you got to say about that, eh
[759]955  Did you really
[760]5458   said Mr
[761]687    Weasley eagerly
[762]1224    Did it go all right
[763]676   I - I mean, he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs
[764]19134    Weasley's eyes, that - that was very wrong, boys - very wrong indeedLet's leave them to it, Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs
[765]1388    Weasley swelled like a bullfrog
[766]1047    Come on, I'll show you my bedroom
[767]788   They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up through the house
[768]689    On the third landing, a door stood ajar
[769]7653    Harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap
[770]7424   Ginny, said Ron
[771]3730    You don't know how weird it is for her to be this shy
[772]6138    She never shuts up normally-They climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALD'S ROOM 
[773]6388   Harry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and blinked
[774]8301    It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron's room seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls, even the ceiling
[775]8567    Then Harry realized that Ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, and waving energetically
[776]238   Your Quidditch team
[777]10818   said Harry
[778]12302   The Chudley Cannons, said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two giant black C's and a speeding cannonball
[779]13    Ninth in the league
[780]7305   Ron's school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle
[781]7624    Ron's magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat, Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun
[782]7056   Harry stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window
[783]248    In the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys'hedge
[784]3068    Then he turned to look at Ron, who was watching him almost nervously, as though waiting for his opinion
[785]12335   It's a bit small, said Ron quickly
[786]1227    Not like that room you had with the Muggles
[787]17663    And I'm right underneath the ghoul in the attic; he's always banging on the pipes and groaningBut Harry, grinning widely, said, This is the best house I've ever been in
[788]7086   Ron's ears went pink

[802]1017    Lionfish 11/Nov/2007     Chapter Four     At Flourish and BlottsContents  Prev Chapter  Next Chapter Life at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive
[803]480    The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys'house burst with the strange and unexpected
[804]7959    Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, Tuck your shirt in, scruffy
[805]6504   The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered perfectly normal
[806]16070    What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's, however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him
[807]369   Mrs
[808]890    Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal
[809]372    Mr
[810]7853    Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked
[811]7   Fascinating 
[812]6067    he would say as Harry talked him through using a telephone
[813]674     Ingenious , really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic
[814]6482   Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the Burrow
[815]2619    He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr
[816]369    and Mrs
[817]1387    Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table
[818]7109    The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter
[819]6745    Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room
[820]1607    She dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun
[821]8964    Pretending he hadn't noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs
[822]650    Weasley offered him
[823]5720   Letters from school, said Mr
[824]8675    Weasley, passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink
[825]9226    Dumbledore already knows you're here, Harry - doesn't miss a trick, that man
[826]2291    You two've got them, too, he added, as Fred and George ambled in, still in their pajamas
[827]359   For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters
[828]16029    Harry's told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King's Cross station on September first
[829]1339    There was also a list of the new books he'd need for the coming year
[830]11791   SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 by Miranda GoshawkBreak with a Banshee by Gilderoy LockhartGadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy LockhartHolidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart43 Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy LockhartVoyages with Vampires by Gilderoy LockhartWanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy LockhartYear with the Yeti by Gilderoy LockhartFred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry's
[831]6049   You've been told to get all Lockhart's books, too
[832]5086   he said
[833]5480    The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan - bet it's a witch
[834]5762   At this point, Fred caught his mother's eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade
[835]8996   That lot won't come cheap, said George, with a quick look at his parents
[836]11355    Lockhart's books are really expensiveWell, we'll manage, said Mrs
[837]1359    Weasley, but she looked worried
[838]6085    I expect we'll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny's things secondhand
[839]820   Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year
[840]6424   Harry asked Ginny
[841]270   She nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her elbow in the butter dish
[842]13934    Fortunately no one saw this except Harry, because just then Ron's elder brother Percy walked in
[843]369    He was already dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest
[844]5332   Morning, all, said Percy briskly
[845]176    Lovely day
[846]6945   He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately, pulling from underneath him a molting, gray feather duster - at least, that was what Harry thought it was, until he saw that it was breathing
[847]9   Errol
[848]7593   said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a letter from under its wing
[849]11937     Finally - he's got Hermione's answer
[850]780    I wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys
[851]4065   He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron lay him on the draining board instead, muttering, Pathetic
[852]31860    Then he ripped open Hermione's letter and read it out loud:`Dear Ron, and Harry if you're there,`I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you didn't do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would get Harry into trouble, too
[853]9394    I've been really worried and if Harry is all right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl because I think another delivery might finish your one off
[854]695   I'm very busy with schoolwork, of course'- How can she be
[855]7114   said Ron in horror
[856]4    We're on vacation
[857]759   - and we're going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books
[858]3036    Why don't we meet in Diagon Alley
[859]5949  Let me know what's happening as soon as you can
[860]1635    Love from Hermione
[861]5596   'Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too, said Mrs
[862]946    Weasley, starting to clear the table
[863]64    What're you all up to today
[864]8764  Harry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned
[865]3564    It was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could practice Quidditch there, as long as they didn't fly too high
[866]3546   They couldn't use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead they threw apples for one another to catch
[867]17907    They took turns riding Harry's Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom; Ron's old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies
[868]309   Five minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over their shoulders
[869]5812    They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them, but he had said he was busy
[870]7401    Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time
[871]5882   Wish I knew what he was up to, said Fred, frowning
[872]4750    He's not himself
[873]1199    His exam results came the day before you did; twelve O
[874]18   W
[875]5   L
[876]4797   s and he hardly gloated at all
[877]11453   Ordinary Wizarding Levels, George explained, seeing Harry's puzzled look
[878]690    Bill got twelve, too
[879]1295    If we're not careful, we'll have another Head Boy in the family
[880]3581    I don't think I could stand the shame
[881]662   Bill was the oldest Weasley brother
[882]548    He and the next brother, Charlie, had already left Hogwarts
[883]11053    Harry had never met either of them, but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt working for the wizard's bank, Gringotts
[884]6662   Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year, said George after a while
[885]290    Five sets of Lockhart books
[886]6001   And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everythingHarry said nothing
[887]484    He felt a bit awkward
[888]541    Stored in an underground vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had left him
[889]2998    Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he had money; you couldn't use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts in Muggle shops
[890]3956    He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account to the Dursleys; he didn't think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold
[891]369   Mrs
[892]739    Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday
[893]805    After a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and Mrs
[894]1161    Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside
[895]247   We're running low, Arthur, she sighed
[896]702    We'll have to buy some more today Ah well, guests first
[897]5822   After you, Harry dear
[898]18  And she offered him the flowerpot
[899]5996   Harry stared at them all watching him
[900]110   W-what am I supposed to do
[901]6   he stammered
[902]11989   He's never traveled by Floo powder, said Ron suddenly
[903]5848    Sorry, Harry, I forgot
[904]0   Never
[905]5458   said Mr
[906]636    Weasley
[907]1265    But how did you get to Diagon Alley to buy your school things last year
[908]499  I went on the Underground-Really
[909]5458   said Mr
[910]687    Weasley eagerly
[911]1    Were there escapators 
[912]5622   How exactly-Not now , Arthur, said Mrs
[913]636    Weasley
[914]12466    Floo powder's a lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you've never used it before-He'll be all right, Mum, said Fred
[915]5813    Harry, watch us first
[916]453   He took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up to the fire, and threw the powder into the flames
[917]1732   With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred, who stepped right into it, shouted, Diagon Alley
[918]58   and vanished
[919]606   You must speak clearly, dear, Mrs
[920]7434    Weasley told Harry as George dipped his hand into the flowerpot
[921]1342    And be sure to get out at the right grateThe right what
[922]11398   said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped George out of sight, too
[923]11267   Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know, but as long as you've spoken clearly-He'll be fine, Molly, don't fuss, said Mr
[924]699    Weasley, helping himself to Floo powder too
[925]1146   But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle
[926]8307  They wouldn't mind, Harry reassured her
[927]10598    Dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don't worry about that-Well all right you go after Arthur, said Mrs
[928]636    Weasley
[929]759    Now, when you get into the fire, say where you're going
[930]2016   And keep your elbows tucked in, Ron advised
[931]6040   And your eyes shut, said Mrs
[932]636    Weasley
[933]10036    The soot-Don't fidget, said Ron
[934]4003    Or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace-But don't panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and George
[935]6768   Trying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire
[936]2175    He took a deep breath, scattered the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a warm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash
[937]659   D-Dia-gon Alley, he coughed
[938]341   It felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain
[939]5455    He seemed to be spinning very fast - the roaring in his ears was deafening - he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick -something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning - now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face - squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond - his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him - he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop, and thenHe fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap
[940]1691   Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding his broken glasses up to his eyes
[941]299    He was quite alone, but where he was, he had no idea
[942]7733    All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard's shop - but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list
[943]1068   A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained pack of cards, and a staring glass eye
[944]1122    Evil-looking masks stared down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling
[945]6450    Even worse, the dark, narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley
[946]885   The sooner he got out of here, the better
[947]15537    Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before he'd got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass - and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy
[948]8210   Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer through
[949]795    Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into the shop
[950]5148   The man who followed could only be Draco's father
[951]1258    He had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes
[952]372    Mr
[953]1577    Malfoy crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying, Touch nothing, Draco
[954]6837   Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, I thought you were going to buy me a present
[955]10442   I said I would buy you a racing broom, said his father, drumming his fingers on the counter
[956]5838   What's the good of that if I'm not on the House team
[957]6230   said Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered
[958]7087    Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year
[959]1070    Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for Gryffindor
[960]15784    He's not even that good, it's just because he's famous famous for having a stupid scar on his foreheadMalfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls
[961]11285   everyone thinks he's so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick-You have told me this at least a dozen times already, said Mr
[962]938    Malfoy, with a quelling look at his son
[963]7157    And I would remind you that it is not - prudent - to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear - ah, Mr
[964]18    Borgin
[965]936   A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his greasy hair back from his face
[966]372   Mr
[967]5917    Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again, said Mr
[968]727    Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair
[969]546    Delighted - and young Master Malfoy, too - charmed
[970]1    How may I be of assistance
[971]1761   I must show you, just in today, and very reasonably priced-I'm not buying today, Mr
[972]5482    Borgin, but selling, said Mr
[973]440    Malfoy
[974]6   Selling
[975]648   The smile faded slightly from Mr
[976]5289    Borgin's face
[977]6170   You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids, said Mr
[978]1319    Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for Mr
[979]146    Borgin to read
[980]355    I have a few - ah - items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to callMr
[981]938    Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the list
[982]2884   The Ministry wouldn't presume to trouble you, sir, surely
[983]372  Mr
[984]5236    Malfoy's lip curled
[985]5   I have not been visited yet
[986]705    The name Malfoy still commands a certain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome
[987]7223    There are rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act - no doubt that flea-bitten, Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it-Harry felt a hot surge of anger
[988]6160   - and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear-I understand, sir, of course, said Mr
[989]18    Borgin
[990]321    Let me seeCan I have that
[991]549   interrupted Draco, pointing at the withered hand on its cushion
[992]408   Ah, the Hand of Glory
[993]5458   said Mr
[994]393    Borgin, abandoning Mr
[995]5286    Malfoy's list and scurrying over to Draco
[996]157    Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder
[997]156   Best friend of thieves and plunderers
[998]267   Your son has fine taste, sir
[999]5582   I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin, said Mr
[1000]844    Malfoy coldly, and Mr
[1001]13881    Borgin said quickly, No offense, sir, no offense meant-Though if his grades don't pick up, said Mr
[1002]5346    Malfoy, more coldly still, that may indeed be all he is fit for-It's not my fault, retorted Draco
[1003]3487    The teachers all have favorites, that Hermione Granger-I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam, snapped Mr
[1004]440    Malfoy
[1005]29   Ha
[1006]11699   said Harry under his breath, pleased to see Draco looking both abashed and angry
[1007]10208   It's the same all over, said Mr
[1008]561    Borgin, in his oily voice
[1009]5715    Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere-Not with me, said Mr
[1010]802    Malfoy, his long nostrils flaring
[1011]5744   No, sir, nor with me, sir, said Mr
[1012]118    Borgin, with a deep bow
[1013]5606   In that case, perhaps we can return to my list, said Mr
[1014]471    Malfoy shortly
[1015]324    I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today-They started to haggle
[1016]6279    Harry watched nervously as Draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale
[1017]5421    Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman's rope and to read, smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals, Caution: Do Not Touch
[1018]154    Cursed - Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date
[1019]1638   Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him
[1020]6080    He walked forward - he stretched out his hand for the handle Done, said Mr
[1021]463    Malfoy at the counter
[1022]7034    Come, Draco-Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away
[1023]876   Good day to you, Mr
[1024]18    Borgin
[1025]691    I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods
[1026]1237   The moment the door had closed, Mr
[1027]103    Borgin dropped his oily manner
[1028]8813   Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you haven't sold me half of what's hidden in your manorMuttering darkly, Mr
[1029]504    Borgin disappeared into a back room
[1030]7065    Harry waited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could, slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop door
[1031]6518   Clutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared around
[1032]465    He had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts
[1033]4166    The one he'd just left, Borgin and Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders
[1034]945    Two shabby-looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other
[1035]7670    Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he'd be able to find a way out of here
[1036]797   An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley
[1037]9039    This didn't help, as Harry had never heard of such a place
[1038]2646    He supposed he hadn't spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys'fire
[1039]376    Trying to stay calm, he wondered what to do
[1040]152   Not lost are you, my dear
[1041]5811   said a voice in his ear, making him jump
[1042]1822   An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails
[1043]89    She leered at him, showing mossy teeth
[1044]6103    Harry backed away
[1045]5642   I'm fine, thanks, he said
[1046]6981    I'm just-HARRY
[1047]1341   What d'yeh think yer doin'down there
[1048]10626  Harry's heart leapt
[1049]3235    So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the Hogwarts'gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard
[1050]652   Hagrid
[1051]5780   Harry croaked in relief
[1052]7979    I was lost - Floo powder-Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands
[1053]584    Her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight
[1054]6281    Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the distance - Gringotts Bank
[1055]1255    Hagrid had steered him right into Diagon Alley
[1056]33   Yer a mess
[1057]11840   said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off Harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary
[1058]18741    Skulkin'around Knockturn Alley, I dunno dodgy place, Harry - don'want no one ter see yeh down there-I realized that , said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to brush him off again
[1059]566    I told you, I was lost - what were you doing down there, anyway
[1060]756  I was lookin'fer a Flesh-Eatin'Slug Repellent, growled Hagrid
[1061]229    They're ruinin'the school cabbages
[1062]44    Yer not on yer own
[1063]6953  I'm staying with the Weasleys but we got separated, Harry explained
[1064]1557    I've got to go and find themThey set off together down the street
[1065]736   How come yeh never wrote back ter me
[1066]17018   said Hagrid as Harry jogged alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride of Hagrid's enormous boots)
[1067]6036    Harry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys
[1068]743   Lousy Muggles, growled Hagrid
[1069]7088    If I'd've known-Harry
[1070]5732   Harry
[1071]0   Over here
[1072]8729  Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts
[1073]381    She ran down to meet them, her bushy brown hair flying behind her
[1074]209   What happened to your glasses
[1075]11678   Hello, Hagrid - Oh, it's wonderful to see you two again - Are you coming into Gringotts, Harry
[1076]11627  As soon as I've found the Weasleys, said Harry
[1077]8909   Yeh won't have long ter wait, Hagrid said with a grin
[1078]11385   Harry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street were Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and Mr
[1079]636    Weasley
[1080]6104   Harry, Mr
[1081]651    Weasley panted
[1082]957    We hoped you'd only gone one grate too far He mopped his glistening bald patch
[1083]10759    Molly's frantic - she's coming now-Where did you come out
[1084]2358   Ron asked
[1085]5804   Knockturn Alley, said Hagrid grimly
[1086]35   Excellent
[1087]5892   said Fred and George together
[1088]7829   We've never been allowed in, said Ron enviously
[1089]1258   I should ruddy well think not, growled Hagrid
[1090]369    Mrs
[1091]2467    Weasley now came galloping into view, her handbag swinging wildly in one hand, Ginny just clinging onto the other
[1092]10759   Oh, Harry - oh, my dear - you could have been anywhere-Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid hadn't managed to beat away
[1093]372    Mr
[1094]12582    Weasley took Harry's glasses, gave them a tap of his wand, and returned them, good as new
[1095]6575   Well, gotta be off, said Hagrid, who was having his hand wrung by Mrs
[1096]673    Weasley ("Knockturn Alley
[1097]3060   If you hadn't found him, Hagrid
[1098]0  ")
[1099]262    See yer at Hogwarts
[1100]986   And he strode away, head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street
[1101]353   Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes
[1102]9818   Harry asked Ron and Hermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps
[1103]535    Malfoy and his father
[1104]1179   Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything
[1105]5458   said Mr
[1106]691    Weasley sharply behind them
[1107]10261   No, he was selling-So he's worried, said Mr
[1108]662    Weasley with grim satisfaction
[1109]7048    Oh, I'd love to get Lucius Malfoy for something You be careful, Arthur, said Mrs
[1110]1235    Weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door
[1111]4894    That family's trouble
[1112]7438    Don't go biting off more than you can chew-So you don't think I'm a match for Lucius Malfoy
[1113]5458   said Mr
[1114]9656    Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of Hermione's parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione to introduce them
[1115]48   But you're Muggles
[1116]5458   said Mr
[1117]641    Weasley delightedly
[1118]28    We must have a drink
[1119]6133   What's that you've got there
[1120]491   Oh, you're changing Muggle money
[1121]499    Molly, look
[1122]519   He pointed excitedly at the ten-pound notes in Mr
[1123]5155    Granger's hand
[1124]14627   Meet you back here, Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin
[1125]5213   The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that sped along miniature train tracks through the bank's underground tunnels
[1126]6515    Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys'vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley, when it was opened
[1127]1354    There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon
[1128]369    Mrs
[1129]1673    Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag
[1130]6203    Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault
[1131]339    He tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag
[1132]238   Back outside on the marble steps, they all separated
[1133]467    Percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill
[1134]1187    Fred and George had spotted their friend from Hogwarts, Lee Jordan
[1135]369    Mrs
[1136]1502    Weasley and Ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop
[1137]372    Mr
[1138]841    Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink
[1139]6178   We'll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks, said Mrs
[1140]993    Weasley, setting off with Ginny
[1141]75    And not one step down Knockturn Alley
[1142]173   she shouted at the twins'retreating backs
[1143]9403   Harry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled street
[1144]11259    The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully in Harry's pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating shop windows
[1145]4854    Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door
[1146]1037    In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr
[1147]6004    Filibuster's Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power 
[1148]2605   A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers, Ron read aloud off the back cover
[1149]558    That sounds fascinating Go away, Percy snapped
[1150]20934   Course, he's very ambitious, Percy, he's got it all planned out He wants to be Minister of Magic Ron told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it
[1151]241   An hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts
[1152]537    They were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop
[1153]1160    As they approached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors, trying to get in
[1154]453    The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows:GILDEROY LOCKHARTwill be signing copies of his autobiographyMAGICAL MEtoday 12:30 P
[1155]441   M
[1156]21    to 4:30 P
[1157]441   M
[1158]103   We can actually meet him
[1159]1625   Hermione squealed
[1160]5021    I mean, he's written almost the whole booklist
[1161]492  The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs
[1162]5413    Weasley's age
[1163]8560    A harassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying, Calmly, please, ladies Don't push, there mind the books, nowHarry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside
[1164]1332    A long line wound right to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books
[1165]927    They each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr
[1166]369    and Mrs
[1167]49    Granger
[1168]6160   Oh, there you are, good, said Mrs
[1169]636    Weasley
[1170]357    She sounded breathless and kept patting her hair
[1171]2517    We'll be able to see him in a minuteGilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd
[1172]6550    The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard's hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair
[1173]1515   A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash
[1174]2721   Out of the way, there, he snarled at Ron, moving back to get a better shot
[1175]7450    This is for the Daily Prophet-Big deal, said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it
[1176]517   Gilderoy Lockhart heard him
[1177]676    He looked up
[1178]8386    He saw Ron - and then he saw Harry
[1179]122    He stared
[1180]8944    Then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted, It can't be Harry Potter
[1181]11257  The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forward, seized Harry's arm, and pulled him to the front
[1182]176    The crowd burst into applause
[1183]12113    Harry's face burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the photographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys
[1184]11312   Nice big smile, Harry, said Lockhart, through his own gleaming teeth
[1185]72    Together, you and I are worth the front page
[1186]17186   When he finally let go of Harry's hand, Harry could hardly feel his fingers
[1187]632    He tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys, but Lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side
[1188]5300   Ladies and gentlemen, he said loudly, waving for quiet
[1189]272    What an extraordinary moment this is
[1190]2149   The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I've been sitting on for some time
[1191]6360  When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he only wanted to buy my autobiography - which I shall be happy to present him now, free of charge - The crowd applauded again
[1192]7245    He had no idea , Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose, that he would shortly be getting much, much more than my book, Magical Me 
[1193]358    He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be getting the real magical me
[1194]1690    Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
[1195]6126  The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being presented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart
[1196]1971    Staggering slightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room, where Ginny was standing next to her new cauldron
[1197]5884   You have these, Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into the cauldron
[1198]3802    I'll buy my own-Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter
[1199]11426   said a voice Harry had no trouble recognizing
[1200]1737    He straightened up and found himself face-to-face with Draco Malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer
[1201]11744   Famous Harry Potter, said Malfoy
[1202]2462    Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page
[1203]3165   Leave him alone, he didn't want all that
[1204]5422   said Ginny
[1205]6306    It was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry
[1206]461    She was glaring at Malfoy
[1207]1852   Potter, you've got yourself a girlfriend
[1208]446   drawled Malfoy
[1209]9631    Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching stacks of Lockhart's books
[1210]13267   Oh, it's you, said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe
[1211]5843    Bet you're surprised to see Harry here, eh
[1212]1159  Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley, retorted Malfoy
[1213]190    I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those
[1214]2627   Ron went as red as Ginny
[1215]8140    He dropped his books into the cauldron, too, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket
[1216]2002   Ron
[1217]5458   said Mr
[1218]1469    Weasley, struggling over with Fred and George
[1219]182    What are you doing
[1220]9960   It's too crowded in here, let's go outside
[1221]702   Well, well, well - Arthur Weasley
[1222]372   It was Mr
[1223]440    Malfoy
[1224]6611    He stood with his hand on Draco's shoulder, sneering in just the same way
[1225]5512   Lucius, said Mr
[1226]692    Weasley, nodding coldly
[1227]6459   Busy time at the Ministry, I hear, said Mr
[1228]440    Malfoy
[1229]73    All those raids I hope they're paying you overtime
[1230]10570  He reached into Ginny's cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossy Lockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration 
[1231]417   Obviously not, Mr
[1232]5526    Malfoy said
[1233]8050    Dear me, what's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it
[1234]372  Mr
[1235]2992    Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny
[1236]5828   We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy, he said
[1237]5529   Clearly, said Mr
[1238]1343    Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr
[1239]369    and Mrs
[1240]199    Granger, who were watching apprehensively
[1241]1160    The company you keep, Weasley and I thought your family could sink no lower
[1242]5793   There was a thud of metal as Ginny's cauldron went flying; Mr
[1243]1039    Weasley had thrown himself at Mr
[1244]478    Malfoy, knocking him backward into a bookshelf
[1245]464    Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads; there was a yell of, Get him, Dad
[1246]1175   from Fred or George; Mrs
[1247]715    Weasley was shrieking, No, Arthur, no
[1248]158  "; the crowd stampeded backward, knocking more shelves over; Gentlemen, please - please
[1249]897   cried the assistant, and then, louder than all-Break it up, there, gents, break it up-Hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books
[1250]558    In an instant he had pulled Mr
[1251]1008    Weasley and Mr
[1252]475    Malfoy apart
[1253]372    Mr
[1254]1072    Weasley had a cut lip and Mr
[1255]694    Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools 
[1256]5470    He was still holding Ginny's old Transfiguration book
[1257]520    He thrust it at her, his eyes glittering with malice
[1258]10726   Here, girl - take your book - it's the best your father can give you - Pulling himself out of Hagrid's grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop
[1259]7030   Yeh should've ignored him, Arthur, said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr
[1260]1052    Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes
[1261]16115    Rotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that - no Malfoy's worth listenin'ter - bad blood, that's what it is - come on now - let's get outta here
[1262]7494   The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid's waist and seemed to think better of it
[1263]591    They hurried up the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs
[1264]658    Weasley beside herself with fury
[1265]7142   A fine example to set for your children brawling in public what Gilderoy Lockhart must've thought-He was pleased, said Fred
[1266]2964    Didn't you hear him as we were leaving
[1267]12148   He was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he'd be able to work the fight into his report - said it was all publicity-But it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry, the Weasleys, and all their shopping would be traveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder
[1268]6030    They said good-bye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side; Mr
[1269]2017    Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs
[1270]5907    Weasley's face
[1271]6128   Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to Floo powder
[1272]2847    It definitely wasn't his favorite way to travel

[1282]11149   The end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry's liking
[1283]1151    He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month at the Burrow had been the happiest of his life
[1284]3753    It was difficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on Privet Drive
[1285]451   On their last evening, Mrs
[1286]11362    Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of Harry's favorite things, ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding
[1287]1686    Fred and George rounded off the evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour
[1288]803    Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed
[1289]783   It took a long while to get started next morning
[1290]306    They were up at dawn, but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do
[1291]369    Mrs
[1292]2707    Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills; people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of toast in their hands; and Mr
[1293]6251    Weasley nearly broke his neck, tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying Ginny's trunk to the car
[1294]9468   Harry couldn't see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia
[1295]616    He had reckoned, of course, without the special features that Mr
[1296]730    Weasley had added
[1297]6146   Not a word to Molly, he whispered to Harry as he opened the
[1298]137    trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily
[1299]484   When at last they were all in the car, Mrs
[1300]18398    Weasley glanced into the back seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side, and said, Muggles do know more than we give them credit for, don't they
[1301]1163   She and Ginny got into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench
[1302]1753    I mean, you'd never know it was this roomy from the outside, would you
[1303]372  Mr
[1304]7262    Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard, Harry turning back for a last look at the house
[1305]1271    He barely had time to wonder when he'd see it again when they were back
[1306]471    George had forgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks
[1307]675    Five minutes after that, they skidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run in for his broomstick
[1308]1470    They had almost reached the highway when Ginny shrieked that she'd left her diary
[1309]960    By the time she had clambered back into the car, they were running very late, and tempers were running high
[1310]372   Mr
[1311]798    Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife
[1312]1377   Molly, dear-No , Arthur --No one would see - this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I installed - that'd get us up in the air - then we fly above the clouds
[1313]10847    We'd be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser-I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight-They reached King's Cross at a quarter to eleven
[1314]372    Mr
[1315]800    Weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station
[1316]6281   Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year
[1317]2865    The tricky part was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn't visible to the Muggle eye
[1318]95    What you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten
[1319]2965    It didn't hurt, but it had to be done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing
[1320]5579   Percy first, said Mrs
[1321]1518    Weasley, looking nervously at the clock overhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier
[1322]309   Percy strode briskly forward and vanished
[1323]372    Mr
[1324]1761    Weasley went next; Fred and George followed
[1325]2265   I'll take Ginny and you two come right after us, Mrs
[1326]14165    Weasley told Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny's hand and setting off
[1327]287    In the blink of an eye they were gone
[1328]19311   Let's go together, we've only got a minute, Ron said to Harry
[1329]11473   Harry made sure that Hedwig's cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier
[1330]2975    He felt perfectly confident; this wasn't nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo powder
[1331]337    Both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed
[1332]728    A few feet away from it, they broke into a run and-CRASH
[1333]20715   Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron's trunk fell off with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig's cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, What in blazes d'you think you're doing
[1334]6622  Lost control of the trolley, Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he got up
[1335]2469    Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd
[1336]2308   Why can't we get through
[1337]7758   Harry hissed to Ron
[1338]2750   I dunno-Ron looked wildly around
[1339]496    A dozen curious people were still watching them
[1340]2728   We're going to miss the train, Ron whispered
[1341]14548    I don't understand why the gateway's sealed itself-Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach
[1342]792    Ten seconds nine secondsHe wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might
[1343]70    The metal remained solid
[1344]12172   Three seconds two seconds one secondIt's gone, said Ron, sounding stunned
[1345]5074    The train's left
[1346]2497    What if Mum and Dad can't get back through to us
[1347]798   Have you got any Muggle money
[1348]6038  Harry gave a hollow laughed
[1349]2811    The Dursleys haven't given me pocket money for about six years
[1350]2207   Ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier
[1351]8261   Can't hear a thing, he said tensely, What're we going to do
[1352]4821   I don't know how long it'll take Mum and Dad to get back to us
[1353]676   They looked around
[1354]5319    People were still watching them, mainly because of Hedwig's continuing screeches
[1355]12376   I think we'd better go and wait by the car, said Harry
[1356]5736    We're attracting too much atten-Harry
[1357]7596   said Ron, his eyes gleaming
[1358]115    The car
[1359]0  What about it
[1360]395  We can fly the car to Hogwarts
[1361]980  But I thought-We're stuck, right
[1362]4046   And we've got to get to school, haven't we
[1363]16780   And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it's a real emergency, section nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy-But your Mum and Dad said Harry, pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way
[1364]78    How will they get home
[1365]3239  They don't need the car
[1366]7133   said Ron impatiently
[1367]779    They know how to Apparate
[1368]1671   You know, just vanish and reappear at home
[1369]5646   They only bother with Floo powder and the car because we're all underage and we're not allowed to Apparate yetHarry's feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement
[1370]40   Can you fly it
[1371]7663  No, problem, said Ron, wheeling his trolley around to face the exit
[1372]5129    C'mon, let's go
[1373]1442    If we hurry we'll be able to follow the Hogwarts Express-And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked
[1374]2498   Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand
[1375]862    They heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into the front
[1376]12470   Check that no one's watching, said Ron, starting the ignition with another tap of his wand
[1377]6556    Harry stuck his head out of the window: Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was empty
[1378]5108   Okay, he said
[1379]2201   Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard
[1380]840    The car around them vanished - and so did they
[1381]7197    Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him, hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars
[1382]18004   Let's go, said Ron's voice from his right
[1383]1119   And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away, dropping out of sight as the car rose; in seconds, the whole of London lay, smoky and glittering, below them
[1384]7951   Then there was a popping noise and the car, Harry, and Ron reappeared
[1385]7503   Uh-oh, said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster
[1386]4752    It's faulty-Both of them pummeled it
[1387]173    The car vanished
[1388]6    Then it flickered back again
[1389]51   Hold on
[1390]2798   Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the accelerator; they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy
[1391]0   Now what
[1392]10911   said Harry, blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides
[1393]8133   We need to see the train to know what direction to go in, said Ron
[1394]466   Dip back down again - quickly-They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats, squinting at the ground
[1395]0   I can see it
[1396]5811   Harry yelled
[1397]610    Right ahead - there
[1398]1086  The Hogwarts Express was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake
[1399]7122   Due north, said Ron, checking the compass on the dashboard
[1400]1796    Okay, we'll just have to check on it every half hour or so - hold on-And they shot up through the clouds
[1401]266    A minute later, they burst out into a blaze of sunlight
[1402]101   It was a different world
[1403]424    The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun
[1404]8517   All we've got to worry about now are airplanes, said Ron
[1405]4325   They looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, they couldn't stop
[1406]72   It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream
[1407]17868    This, thought Harry, was surely the only way to travel - past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeing Fred's and George's jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of Hogwarts castle
[1408]317   They made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view
[1409]2201    London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches
[1410]6018   Several uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off
[1411]60    The toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink
[1412]15590    He and Ron had pulled off their sweaters, but Harry's T-shirt was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose
[1413]632    He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could buy ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch
[1414]2556    Why hadn't they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters
[1415]2308  Can't be much further, can it
[1416]2764   croaked Ron, hours later still, as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink
[1417]164    Ready for another check on the train
[1418]1082  It was still right below them, winding its way past a snowcapped mountain
[1419]72    It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds
[1420]2893   Ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again, but as he did so, the engine began to whine
[1421]7796   Harry and Ron exchanged nervous glances
[1422]12734   It's probably just tired, said Ron
[1423]5112    It's never been this far beforeAnd they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker
[1424]30    Stars were blossoming in the blackness
[1425]6569    Harry pulled his sweater back on, trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly, as though in protest
[1426]13267   Not far, said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, not far now, and he patted the dashboard nervously
[1427]863   When they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew
[1428]0   There
[1429]8078   Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig jump
[1430]147    Straight ahead
[1431]976  Silhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake, stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle
[1432]173   But the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed
[1433]8494   Come on, Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a little shake, nearly there, come on-The engine groaned
[1434]53    Narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood
[1435]6074    Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake
[1436]375   The car gave a nasty wobble
[1437]6567    Glancing out of his window, Harry saw the smooth, black, glassy surface of the water, a mile below
[1438]6855    Ron's knuckles were white on the steering wheel
[1439]117    The car wobbled again
[1440]2545   Come on, Ron muttered
[1441]2824   They were over the lake - the castle was right ahead - Ron put his foot down
[1442]222   There was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died completely
[1443]7537   Uh-oh, said Ron, into the silence
[1444]304   The nose of the car dropped
[1445]456    They were falling, gathering speed, heading straight for the solid castle wall
[1446]3   Noooooo
[1447]4640   Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc, soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time
[1448]3154   Ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket-STOP
[1449]133   STOP
[1450]417   he yelled, whacking the dashboard and the windshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up toward them-WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE
[1451]5828   Harry bellowed, lunging for the steering wheel, but too late-CRUNCH
[1452]557   With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt
[1453]14249    Steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in terror; a golfball-size lump was throbbing on Harry's head where he had hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron let out a low, despairing groan
[1454]22   Are you okay
[1455]10841   Harry said urgently
[1456]8039   My wand, said Ron, in a shaky voice
[1457]1033    Look at my wand-It had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by a few splinters
[1458]8363   Harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they'd be able to mend it up at the school, but he never even got started
[1459]3573    At that very moment, something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof
[1460]4797   What's happen -
[1461]10016  Ron gasped, staring through the windshield, and Harry looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it
[1462]167    The tree they had hit was attacking them
[1463]326    Its trunk was bent almost double, and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach
[1464]2   Aaargh
[1465]8708   said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving in
[1466]70   Run for it
[1467]13430   Ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door, but next second he had been knocked backward into Harry's lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch
[1468]0   We're done for
[1469]591   he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating - the engine had restarted
[1470]6   Reverse
[1471]6672   Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still trying to hit them; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach
[1472]2115   That, panted Ron, was close
[1473]582    Well done, car-The car, however, had reached the end of its tether
[1474]7187    With two sharp clunks, the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways: Next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground
[1475]6749    Loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk; Hedwig's cage flew through the air and burst open; she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look
[1476]305    Then, dented, scratched, and steaming, the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily
[1477]436   Come back
[1478]2535   Ron yelled after it, brandishing his broken wand
[1479]761    Dad'll kill me
[1480]208  But the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust
[1481]124   Can you believe our luck
[1482]7152   said Ron miserably, bending down to pick up Scabbers
[1483]863    Of all the trees we could've hit, we had to get one that hits back
[1484]285   He glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still flailing its branches threateningly
[1485]14550   Come on, said Harry wearily, we'd better get up to the schoolIt wasn't at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured
[1486]738    Stiff, cold, and bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors
[1487]13620   I think the feast's already started, said Ron, dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window
[1488]11436    Hey - Harry - come and look - it's the Sorting
[1489]8285  Harry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the Great Hall
[1490]653   Innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long, crowded tables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle
[1491]302    Overhead, the bewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the sky outside, sparkled with stars
[1492]8169   Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, Harry saw a long line of scared-looking first years filing into the Hall
[1493]1188    Ginny was among them, easily visible because of her vivid Weasley hair
[1494]1712    Meanwhile, Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers
[1495]1481   Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new students into the four Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin)
[1496]6463    Harry well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear
[1497]5849    For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the house that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Weasleys
[1498]9144    Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven years
[1499]1264   A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head
[1500]14119    Harry's eyes wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight
[1501]6503    Several seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart, dressed in robes of aquamarine
[1502]966    And there at the end was Hagrid, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet
[1503]7859   Hang on Harry muttered to Ron
[1504]10336    There's an empty chair at the staff table Where's Snape
[1505]11799  Professor Severus Snape was Harry's least favorite teacher
[1506]11143    Harry also happened to be Snape's least favorite student
[1507]1115    Cruel, sarcastic, and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house (Slytherin), Snape taught Potions
[1508]4841   Maybe he's ill
[1509]7112   said Ron hopefully
[1510]16378   Maybe he's left , said Harry, because he missed out on the Defense Against Dark Arts job again
[1511]13  Or he might have been sacked
[1512]7100   said Ron enthusiastically
[1513]14609    I mean, everyone hates him-Or maybe, said a very cold voice right behind them, he's waiting to hear why you two didn't arrive on the school train
[1514]5740   Harry spun around
[1515]1152    There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze, stood Severus Snape
[1516]9708    He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he was smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep trouble
[1517]5600   Follow me, said Snape
[1518]9238   Not daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron followed Snape up the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches
[1519]1785    A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great Hall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and light, down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons
[1520]0   In
[1521]5860   he said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing
[1522]5493   They entered Snape's office, shivering
[1523]10696    The shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars, in which floated all manner of revolting things Harry didn't really want to know the name of at the moment
[1524]326    The fireplace was dark and empty
[1525]1869    Snape closed the door and turned to look at them
[1526]14792   So, he said softly, the train isn't good enough for the famous Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick Weasley
[1527]903    Wanted to arrive with a bang , did we, boys
[1528]5046  No, sir, it was the barrier at King's Cross, it-Silence
[1529]5598   said Snape coldly
[1530]115    What have you done with the car
[1531]2012   Ron gulped
[1532]9587    This wasn't the first time Snape had given Harry the impression of being able to read minds
[1533]5866    But a moment later, he understood, as Snape unrolled today's issue of the Evening Prophet 
[1534]377    You were seen, he hissed, showing them the headline : FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES
[1535]1667    He began to read aloud: Two Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower at noon in Norfolk, Mrs
[1536]420    Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing Mr
[1537]111    Angus Fleet, of Peebles, reported to police Six or seven Muggles in all
[1538]485    I believe your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office
[1539]7766   he said, looking up at Ron and smiling still more nastily
[1540]6880    Dear, dear his own sonHarry felt as though he'd just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree's larger branches
[1541]372    If anyone found out Mr
[1542]4375    Weasley had bewitched the car he hadn't thought of thatI noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow, Snape went on
[1543]2745   That tree did more damage to us than we - Ron blurted out
[1544]82   Silence
[1545]531   snapped Snape again
[1546]451    Most unfortunately, you are not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with me
[1547]417    I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power
[1548]77    You will wait here
[1549]7971   Harry and Ron stared at each other, white-faced
[1550]8578    Harry didn't feel hungry any more
[1551]345    He now felt extremely sick
[1552]6300    He tried not to look at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind Snape's desk
[1553]2746    If Snape had gone to fetch Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, they were hardly any better off
[1554]515    She might be fairer than Snape, but she was still extremely strict
[1555]2025   Ten minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was Professor McGonagall who accompanied him
[1556]8273    Harry had seen Professor McGonagall angry on several occasions, but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen her this angry before
[1557]8901    She raised her wand the moment she entered; Harry and Ron both flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where flames suddenly erupted
[1558]5182   Sit, she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire
[1559]5205   Explain, she said, her glasses glinting ominously
[1560]2473   Ron launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through
[1561]3260   - so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn't get on the train
[1562]2918   Why didn't you send us a letter by owl
[1563]204   I believe you have an owl
[1564]11856   Professor McGonagall said coldly to Harry
[1565]5740   Harry gaped at her
[1566]5287    Now she said it, that seemed the obvious thing to have done
[1567]9378   I - I didn't think-That, said Professor McGonagall, is obvious
[1568]1948   There was a knock on the office door and Snape, now looking happier than ever, opened it
[1569]1779    There stood the headmaster, Professor Dumbledore
[1570]10764   Harry's whole body went numb
[1571]1433    Dumbledore was looking unusually grave
[1572]8119    He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and Harry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still being beaten up by the Whomping Willow
[1573]435   There was a long silence
[1574]6608    Then Dumbledore said, Please explain why you did this
[1575]318   It would have been better if he had shouted
[1576]6292    Harry hated the disappointment in his voice
[1577]2006    For some reason, he was unable to look Dumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees
[1578]1511    He told Dumbledore everything except that Mr
[1579]3458    Weasley owned the bewitched car, making it sound as though he and Ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station
[1580]2425    He knew Dumbledore would see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no questions about the car
[1581]5955    When Harry had finished, he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles
[1582]8336   We'll go and get our stuff, said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice
[1583]780   What are you talking about, Weasley
[1584]1021   barked Professor McGonagall
[1585]2364   Well, you're expelling us, aren't you
[1586]7088   said Ron
[1587]7380   Harry looked quickly at Dumbledore
[1588]436   Not today, Mr
[1589]6539    Weasley, said Dumbledore
[1590]5    But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done
[1591]101    I will be writing to both your families tonight
[1592]779    I must also warn you that if you do anything like this again, I will have no choice but to expel you
[1593]1228   Snape looked as though Christmas had been canceled
[1594]14150    He cleared his throat and said, Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree - surely acts of this nature-It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys'punishments, Severus, said Dumbledore calmly
[1595]217    They are in her House and are therefore her responsibility
[1596]1338    He turned to Professor McGonagall
[1597]1439    I must go back to the feast, Minerva, I've got to give out a few notices
[1598]16979    Come, Severus, there's a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample-Snape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office, leaving them alone with Professor McGonagall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle
[1599]1569   You'd better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you're bleeding
[1600]7358   Not much, said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve
[1601]7153   Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted-The Sorting Ceremony is over, said Professor McGonagall
[1602]207    Your sister is also in Gryffindor
[1603]7793   Oh, good, said Ron
[1604]18735   And speaking of Gryffindor - Professor McGonagall said sharply, but Harry cut in: Professor, when we took the car, term hadn't started, so - so Gryffindor shouldn't really have points taken from it - should it
[1605]247   he finished, watching her anxiously
[1606]1959   Professor McGonagall gave him a piercing look, but he was sure she had almost smiled
[1607]858    Her mouth looked less thin, anyway
[1608]15910   I will not take any points from Gryffindor, she said, and Harry's heart lightened considerably
[1609]44    But you will both get a detention
[1610]5955    It was better than Harry had expected
[1611]5687    As for Dumbledore's writing to the Dursleys, that was nothing
[1612]9944    Harry knew perfectly well they'd just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn't squashed him flat
[1613]6986   Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape's desk
[1614]490    A large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop
[1615]5253   You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory, she said
[1616]84    I must also return to the feast
[1617]3381   When the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a long, low whistle
[1618]6107   I thought we'd had it, he said, grabbing a sandwich
[1619]11610   So did I, said Harry, taking one, too
[1620]124   Can you believe our luck, though
[1621]7120   said Ron thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham
[1622]2117    Fred and George must've flown that car five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them 
[1623]281    He swallowed and took another huge bite
[1624]2454     Why couldn't we get through the barrier
[1625]5749  Harry shrugged
[1626]5947    We'll have to watch our step from now on, though, he said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice
[1627]11039    Wish we could've gone up to the feastShe didn't want us showing off, said Ron sagely
[1628]8588    Doesn't want people to think it's clever, arriving by flying car
[1629]937   When they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could (the plate kept refilling itself) they rose and left the office, treading the familiar path to Gryffindor Tower
[1630]183    The castle was quiet; it seemed that the feast was over
[1631]1344    They walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress
[1632]9   Password
[1633]5110   she said as they approached
[1634]10939   Er - said Harry
[1635]11892   They didn't know the new year's password, not having met a Gryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost immediately; they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see Hermione dashing toward them
[1636]0   There you are
[1637]0   Where have you been 
[1638]5959   The most ridiculous rumors - someone said you'd been expelled for crashing a flying car
[1639]8222  Well, we haven't been expelled, Harry assured her
[1640]800   You're not telling me you did fly here
[1641]7754   said Hermione, sounding almost as severe as Professor McGonagall
[1642]7626   Skip the lecture, said Ron impatiently, and tell us the new password
[1643]16984   It's wattlebird,' said Hermione impatiently, but that's not the point-Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping
[1644]1995    It looked as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into the circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive
[1645]9940    Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to scramble in after them
[1646]26   Brilliant
[1647]134   yelled Lee Jordan
[1648]3    Inspired
[1649]71   What an entrance
[1650]25016   Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people'll be talking about that one for years-Good for you, said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was patting him on the back as though he'd just won a marathon; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, Why couldn't we've come in the car, eh
[1651]11628  Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could see one person who didn't look happy at all
[1652]839    Percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off
[1653]12730    Harry nudged Ron in the ribs and nodded in Percy's direction
[1654]2777    Ron got the point at once
[1655]7594   Got to get upstairs - bit tired, he said, and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room, which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories
[1656]14150   Night, Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl just like Percy's
[1657]786   They managed to get to the other side of the common room, still having their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase
[1658]2001    They hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of their old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS
[1659]909    They entered the familiar, circular room, with its five four-posters hung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows
[1660]252    Their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds
[1661]7753   Ron grinned guiltily at Harry
[1662]5958   I know I shouldn't've enjoyed that or anything, butThe dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom
[1663]6   Unbelievable
[1664]97   beamed Seamus
[1665]5193   Cool, said Dean
[1666]5407   Amazing, said Neville, awestruck
[1667]8314   Harry couldn't help it
[1668]15    He grinned, too

[1679]5972     The next day, however, Harry barely grinned once
[1680]758    Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall
[1681]929    The four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy gray)
[1682]10184    Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug
[1683]12048    There was a slight stiffness in the way she said Morning, which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived
[1684]721    Neville Longbottom, on the other hand, greeted them cheerfully
[1685]6487    Neville was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met
[1686]10292   Mail's due any minute - I think Gran's sending a few things I forgot
[1687]7458   Harry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd
[1688]12689    A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville's head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione's jug, spraying them all with milk and feathers
[1689]9   Errol
[1690]7511   said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet
[1691]641    Errol slumped, Unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak
[1692]2404   Oh, no - Ron gasped
[1693]16907   It's all right, he's still alive, said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger
[1694]9500   It's not that - it's that 
[1695]2216   Ron was pointing at the red envelope
[1696]9566    It looked quite ordinary to Harry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode
[1697]4836   What's the matter
[1698]10818   said Harry
[1699]16696   She's - she's sent me a Howler, said Ron faintly
[1700]8481   You'd better open it, Ron, said Neville in a timid whisper
[1701]3736    It'll be worse if you Don't My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and - he gulped -it was horrible
[1702]6581   Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope
[1703]4763   What's a Howler
[1704]5086   he said
[1705]6953   But Ron's whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to smoke at the corners
[1706]557   Open it, Neville urged
[1707]8226    It'll all be over in a few minutes-Ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol's beak, and slit it open
[1708]480    Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears
[1709]6323    A split second later, Harry knew why
[1710]1240    He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar of sound filled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling
[1711]8197   -STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY'D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE-Mrs
[1712]679    Weasleys yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls
[1713]3027    People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen
[1714]17139   -LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN'T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED-Harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up
[1715]4033    He tried very hard to look as though he couldn't hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb
[1716]10622   -ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED - YOUR FATHER'S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME
[1717]236   A ringing silence fell
[1718]7433    The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron's hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes
[1719]8831    Harry and Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them
[1720]534    A few people laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again
[1721]9645   Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron's head
[1722]11086   Well, I don't know what you expected, Ron, but you-Don't tell me I deserved it, snapped Ron
[1723]6131   Harry pushed his porridge away
[1724]59    His insides were burning with guilt
[1725]372    Mr
[1726]775    Weasley was facing an inquiry at work
[1727]372    After all Mr
[1728]369    and Mrs
[1729]2936    Weasley had done for him over the summerBut he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was moving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules
[1730]6336    Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs first
[1731]10042   Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the vegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical plants were kept
[1732]2773    At least the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again
[1733]1741   As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside, waiting for Professor Sprout
[1734]10763    Harry, Ron, and Hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart
[1735]11459    Professor Sprout's arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt, Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its branches now in slings
[1736]2010   Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint
[1737]901    Gilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming
[1738]398   Oh, hello there
[1739]313   he called, beaming around at the assembled students
[1740]2561    Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow
[1741]4439   But I don't want you running away with the idea that I'm better at Herbology than she is
[1742]993   I just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travelsGreenhouse three today, chaps
[1743]6631   said Professor Sprout, who was looking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self
[1744]8   There was a murmur of interest
[1745]268    They had only ever worked in greenhouse one before - greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants
[1746]1733    Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door
[1747]6104    Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrella-sized flowers dangling from the ceiling
[1748]9207    He was about to follow Ron and Hermione inside when Lockhart's hand shot out
[1749]5732   Harry
[1750]9638   I've been wanting a word - you don't mind if he's a couple of minutes late, do you, Professor Sprout
[1751]17547  Judging by Professor Sprout's scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said, That's the ticket, and closed the greenhouse door in her face
[1752]11977   Harry, said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head
[1753]17196    Harry, Harry, Harry
[1754]10881   Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing
[1755]515   When I heard - well, of course, it was all my fault
[1756]26    Could have kicked myself
[1757]5987   Harry had no idea what he was talking about
[1758]5104    He was about to say so when Lockhart went on, Don't know when I've been more shocked
[1759]426    Flying a car to Hogwarts
[1760]1116   Well, of course, I knew at once why you'd done it
[1761]159    Stood out a mile
[1762]17196    Harry, Harry, Harry 
[1763]2671   It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasn't talking
[1764]2947   Gave you a taste for publicity, didn't I
[1765]5290   said Lockhart
[1766]229    Gave you the bug 
[1767]3294    You got onto the front page of the paper with me and you couldn't wait to do it again
[1768]23729   Oh, no, Professor, see-Harry, Harry, Harry, said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping his shoulder
[1769]88    I understand 
[1770]4640    Natural to want a bit more once you've had that first taste - and I blame myself for giving you that, because it was bound to go to your head - but see here, young man, you can't start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed
[1771]1396    Just calm down, all right
[1772]586   Plenty of time for all that when you're older
[1773]1443    Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking
[1774]10230   It's all right for him, he's an internationally famous wizard already
[1775]808  'But when I was twelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are now
[1776]972    In fact, I'd say I was even more of a nobody
[1777]3252   I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven't they
[1778]61   All that business with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
[1779]10680   He glanced at the lightning scar on Harry's forehead
[1780]27279    I know, I know - it's not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly's Most Charming Smile Award five times in a row, as I have - but it's a start , Harry, it's a start 
[1781]6020   He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off
[1782]7018    Harry stood stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse, he opened the door and slid inside
[1783]987   Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse
[1784]231    About twenty pairs of different-colored ear muffs were lying on the bench
[1785]15340    When Harry had taken his place between Ron and Hermione, she said, We'll be repotting Mandrakes today
[1786]346    Now, who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake
[1787]11670  To nobody's surprise, Hermione's hand was first into the air
[1788]6893   Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative, said Hermione, sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook
[1789]466    It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state
[1790]35   Excellent
[1791]6119    Ten points to Gryffindor, said Professor Sprout
[1792]18    The Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes
[1793]47    It is also, however, dangerous
[1794]332    Who can tell me why
[1795]17362  Hermione's hand narrowly missed Harry's glasses as it shot up again
[1796]5115   The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it, she said promptly
[1797]9   Precisely
[1798]5926    Take another ten points, said Professor Sprout
[1799]53    Now, the Mandrakes we have here are still very young
[1800]983   She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone shuffled forward for a better look
[1801]442    A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were growing there in rows
[1802]11101    They looked quite unremarkable to Harry, who didn't have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the cry of the Mandrake
[1803]5942   Everyone take a pair of earmuffs, said Professor Sprout
[1804]2713   There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn't pink and fluffy
[1805]6854   When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely covered, said Professor Sprout
[1806]53    When it is safe to remove them, I will give you the thumbs-up
[1807]563    Right - earmuffs on 
[1808]5879   Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears
[1809]266    They shut out sound completely
[1810]1584    Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard
[1811]6295   Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear
[1812]371   Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth
[1813]1107    The leaves were growing right out of his head
[1814]248    He had pale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs
[1815]1855   Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible
[1816]1221    Professor Sprout dusted off her hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs
[1817]9144   As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won't kill yet, she said calmly as though she'd just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia
[1818]2019    However, they will knock you out for several hours, and as I'm sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work
[1819]612    I will attract your attention when it is time to pack up
[1820]5026   Four to a tray - there is a large supply of pots here - compost in the sacks over there - and be careful of the Venemous Tentacula, it's teething
[1821]1340   She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder
[1822]15729   Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to
[1823]11383   Justin Finch-Fletchley, he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand
[1824]13505    Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter And you're Hermione Granger - always top in everything (Hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too) - and Ron Weasley
[1825]2635    Wasn't that your flying car
[1826]4809  Ron didn't smile
[1827]209    The Howler was obviously still on his mind
[1828]7363   That Lockhart's something, isn't he
[1829]5376   said Justin happily as they began filling their plant pots with dragon dung compost
[1830]23    Awfully brave chap
[1831]208    Have you read his books
[1832]1614   I'd have died of fear if Id been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and - zap - just fantastic 
[1833]773   My name was down for Eton, you know
[1834]2959    I can't tell you how glad I am I came here instead
[1835]14615    Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed, but since I made her read Lockhart's books I think she's begun to see how useful it'll be to have a fully trained wizard in the familyAfter that they didn't have much chance to talk
[1836]60    Their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes
[1837]3750    Professor Sprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn't
[1838]6639    The Mandrakes didn't like coming out of the earth, but didn't seem to want to go back into it either
[1839]6629    They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot
[1840]6955   By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, aching, and covered in earth
[1841]302    Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration
[1842]6181   Professor McGonagall's classes were always hard work, but today was especially difficult
[1843]6489    Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer
[1844]796    He was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand
[1845]2307   Ron was having far worse problems
[1846]431    He had patched up his wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair
[1847]2973    It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs
[1848]2507    Unable to see what he was doing, Ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one
[1849]3514    Professor McGonagall wasn't pleased
[1850]6029   Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell
[1851]1067    His brain felt like a wrung sponge
[1852]2652    Everyone filed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk
[1853]7602   Stupid - useless - thing-Write home for another one, Harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker
[1854]8245   Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back, said Ron, stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag
[1855]19414     It's your own fault your wand got snapped -'They went down to lunch, where Ron's mood was not improved by Hermione's showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in Transfiguration
[1856]1422   What've we got this afternoon
[1857]10929   said Harry, hastily changing the subject
[1858]7088   Defense Against the Dark Arts, said Hermione at once
[1859]7359   Why , demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, have you outlined all Lockhart's lessons in little hearts
[1860]1692  Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously
[1861]439   They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard
[1862]2034    Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires again
[1863]14198    Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely watched
[1864]8519    Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he'd seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though transfixed
[1865]8585    He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment Harry looked at him, he went bright red
[1866]6289   All right, Harry
[1867]6279   I'm - I'm Colin Creevey, he said breathlessly, taking a tentative step forward
[1868]634    I'm in Gryffindor, too
[1869]1784    D'you think - would it be all right if - can I have a picture
[1870]5153   he said, raising the camera hopefully
[1871]44   A picture
[1872]5807   Harry repeated blankly
[1873]6041   So I can prove I've met you, said Colin Creevey eagerly, edging further forward
[1874]771    I know all about you
[1875]5072    Everyone's told me
[1876]20007    About how you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how you've still got a lightning scar on your forehead (his eyes raked Harry's hairline) and a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures'll move 
[1877]12713    Colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said, It's amazing here, isn't it
[1878]1655   I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts
[1879]7399    My dad's a milkman, he couldn't believe it either
[1880]714    So I'm taking loads of pictures to send home to him
[1881]7865    And it'd be really good if I had one of you - he looked imploringly at Harry - maybe your friend could take it and I could stand next to you
[1882]67   And then, could you sign it
[1883]35  Signed photos
[1884]566   You're giving out signed photos , Potter
[1885]5916  Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy's voice echoed around the courtyard
[1886]1344    He had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he always was at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle
[1887]43   Everyone line up
[1888]578   Malfoy roared to the crowd
[1889]11048    Harry Potter's giving out signed photos
[1890]11367  No, I'm not, said Harry angrily, his fists clenching
[1891]545    Shut up, Malfoy
[1892]5840   You're just jealous, piped up Colin, whose entire body was about as thick as Crabbe's neck
[1893]6   Jealous
[1894]8688   said Malfoy, who didn't need to shout anymore: half the courtyard was listening in
[1895]0    Of what
[1896]4476   I don't want a foul scar right across my head, thanks
[1897]4443    I don't think getting your head cut open makes you that special, myself
[1898]169   Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly
[1899]7645   Eat slugs, Malfoy, said Ron angrily
[1900]752    Crabbe stopped laughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way
[1901]1119   Be careful, Weasley, sneered Malfoy
[1902]4992    You don't want to start any trouble or your Mommy'll have to come and take you away from school
[1903]551    He put on a shrill, piercing voice
[1904]622     If you put another toe out of line-A knot of Slytherin fifth-years nearby laughed loudly at this
[1905]2315   Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter, smirked Malfoy
[1906]10440    It'd be worth more than his family's whole house-Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and whispered, Look out
[1907]9500  What's all this, what's all this
[1908]429   Gilderoy Lockhart was striding toward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him
[1909]4855    Who's giving out signed photos
[1910]9099  Harry started to speak but he was cut short as Lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and thundered jovially, Shouldn't have asked
[1911]5784   We meet again, Harry
[1912]11617  Pinned to Lockhart's side and burning with humiliation, Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd
[1913]808   Come on then, Mr
[1914]5400    Creevey, said Lockhart, beaming at Colin
[1915]3213    A double portrait, can't do better than that, and we'll both sign it for you
[1916]557   Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes
[1917]7112   Off you go, move along there, Lockhart called to the crowd, and he set off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing he knew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to his side
[1918]11695   A word to the wise, Harry, said Lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door
[1919]14403    I covered up for you back there with young Creevey - if he was photographing me, too, your schoolmates won't think you're setting yourself up so muchDeaf to Harry's stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase
[1920]9730   Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career isn't sensible - looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be frank
[1921]6697    There may well come a time when, like me, you'll need to keep a stack handy wherever you go, but - he gave a little chortle - I don't think you're quite there yet
[1922]11184   They had reached Lockhart's classroom and he let Harry go at last
[1923]12168    Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart's books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at the real thing
[1924]9967   The rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Hermione sat down on either side of Harry
[1925]8324   You could've fried an egg on your face said Ron
[1926]10516    You'd better hope Creevey doesn't meet Ginny, or they'll be starting a Harry Potter fan club
[1927]5888   Shut up, snapped Harry
[1928]7603    The last thing he needed was for Lockhart to hear the phrase Harry Potter fan clubWhen the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell
[1929]5481    He reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom's copy of Travels with Trolls , and held it up to show his own, winking portrait on the front
[1930]5195   Me, he said, pointing at it and winking as well
[1931]9513    Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most Charming Smile Award but I don't talk about that
[1932]2810    I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her
[1933]454  He waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly
[1934]944   I see you've all bought a complete set of my books - well done
[1935]1439    I thought we'd start today with a little quiz
[1936]8044    Nothing to worry about - just to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in-When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said, You have thirty minutes - start - now
[1937]6580  Harry looked down at his paper and read:1
[1938]5014    What is Gilderoy Lockhart s favorite color
[1939]0  2
[1940]5041    What is Gilderoy Lockhart's secret ambition
[1941]0  3
[1942]5050    What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date
[1943]813  On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to:54
[1944]5028    When is Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday, and what would his ideal gift be
[1945]745  Half an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class
[1946]122   Tut, tut - hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac
[1947]451    I say so in Year with the Yeti 
[1948]4246    And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully - I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples - though I wouldn't say no to a large bottle of Ogdeds Old Firewhisky
[1949]235  He gave them another roguish wink
[1950]3489    Ron was now staring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were sitting in front, were shaking with silent laughter
[1951]2595    Hermione, on the other hand, was listening to Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name
[1952]2874    but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions - good girl
[1953]141   In fact - he flipped her paper over - full marks
[1954]1729   Where is Miss Hermione Granger
[1955]2132  Hermione raised a trembling hand
[1956]35   Excellent
[1957]223   beamed Lockhart
[1958]223    Quite excellent
[1959]242   Take ten points for Gryffindor
[1960]557   And so - to business-He bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it
[1961]26   Now - be warned
[1962]252   It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind
[1963]521   You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room
[1964]785    Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here
[1965]164    All I ask is that you remain calm
[1966]6559   In spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of books for a better look at the cage
[1967]632    Lockhart placed a hand on the cover
[1968]322    Dean and Seamus had stopped laughing now
[1969]419    Neville was cowering in his front row seat
[1970]6052   I must ask you not to scream, said Lockhart in a low voice
[1971]2    It might provoke them
[1972]548   As the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the cover
[1973]5385   Yes, he said dramatically
[1974]114    Freshly caught Cornish pixies
[1975]2560   Seamus Finnigan couldn't control himself
[1976]3098    He let out a snort of laughter that even Lockhart couldn't mistake for a scream of terror
[1977]292   Yes
[1978]113   He smiled at Seamus
[1979]47   Well, they're not - they're not very - dangerous , are they
[1980]90   Seamus choked
[1981]3168   Don't be so sure
[1982]5400   said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at Seamus
[1983]296    Devilish tricky little blighters they can be
[1984]1288  The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing
[1985]973    The moment the cover had been removed, they had started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them
[1986]5983   Right, then, Lockhart said loudly
[1987]5274    Let's see what you make of them
[1988]206   And he opened the cage
[1989]2   It was pandemonium
[1990]838    The pixies shot in every direction like rockets
[1991]645    Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air
[1992]484    Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row with broken glass
[1993]173    The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino
[1994]1734    They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling
[1995]1035   Come on now - round them up, round them up, they're only pixies, Lockhart shouted
[1996]483   He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed,  Peskipiksi Pesternomi
[1997]748   It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window, too
[1998]1727    Lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way
[1999]214   The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit
[2000]17142    In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, Well, I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage
[2001]956    He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him
[2002]101   Can you believe him
[2003]2347   roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear
[2004]7860   He just wants to give us some hands-on experience, said Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into their cage
[2005]175   Hands on 
[2006]11127   said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out
[2007]11253    Hermione, he didn't have a clue what he was doing-Rubbish, said Hermione
[2008]13195    You've read his books - look at all those amazing things he's done-He says he's done, Ron muttered

[2019]7403     Harry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor
[2020]10603    Harder to avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry's schedule
[2021]6619    Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, All right, Harry
[2022]11432   six or seven times a day and hear, Hello, Colin, back, however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it
[2023]22348   Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disastrous car journey and Ron's wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron's hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck
[2024]6178    So with one thing and another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend
[2025]4434    He, Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning
[2026]6373    Harry, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier than he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team
[2027]1   Whassamatter
[2028]10819   said Harry groggily
[2029]186   Quidditch practice
[2030]5146   said Wood
[2031]436    Come on
[2032]5903  Harry squinted at the window
[2033]205    There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky
[2034]2675    Now that he was awake, he couldn't understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making
[2035]5763   Oliver, Harry croaked
[2036]4793    It's the crack of dawn
[2037]5247   Exactly, said Wood
[2038]1001    He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm
[2039]4918    It's part of our new training program
[2040]10731    Come on, grab your broom, and let's go, said Wood heartily
[2041]7393    None of the other teams have started training yet; we're going to be first off the mark this year-Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes
[2042]5610   Good man, said Wood
[2043]186    Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes
[2044]10659   When he'd found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he'd gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder
[2045]1873    He had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand
[2046]6181   I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry
[2047]1840   Look what I've got here
[2048]7465   I've had it developed, I wanted to show you-Harry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing under his nose
[2049]6644   A moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm Harry recognized as his own
[2050]558    He was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view
[2051]6466    As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and slumped, Panting, against the white edge of the picture
[2052]67   Will you sign it
[2053]5185   said Colin eagerly
[2054]11649   No, said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was really deserted
[2055]922    Sorry, Colin, I'm in a hurry - Quidditch practice-He climbed through the portrait hole
[2056]371   Oh, wow
[2057]77   Wait for me
[2058]943   I've never watched a Quidditch game before
[2059]97  Colin scrambled through the hole after him
[2060]12487   It'll be really boring, Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his face shining with excitement
[2061]8478   You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren't you, Harry
[2062]2355   Weren't you
[2063]5145   said Colin, trotting alongside him
[2064]26    You must be brilliant
[2065]704    I've never flown
[2066]24    Is it easy
[2067]57   Is that your own broom
[2068]91   Is that the best one there is
[2069]9242  Harry didn't know how to get rid of him
[2070]885    It was like having an extremely talkative shadow
[2071]8614   I don't really understand Quidditch, said Colin breathlessly
[2072]68    Is it true there are four balls
[2073]619   And two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms
[2074]11343  Yes, said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch
[2075]125    They're called Bludgers
[2076]486    There are two Beaters on each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side
[2077]1643    Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters
[2078]16   And what are the other balls for
[2079]6586   Colin asked, tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry
[2080]4886   Well, the Quaffle - that's the biggish red one - is the one that scores goals
[2081]1116    Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch - they're three long poles with hoops on the end
[2082]16047   And the fourth ball-- is the Golden Snitch, said Harry, and it's very small, very fast, and difficult to catch
[2083]13149    But that's what the Seeker's got to do, because a game of Quidditch doesn't end until the Snitch has been caught
[2084]5135    And whichever team's Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points
[2085]2569   And you're the Gryffindor Seeker, aren't you
[2086]5137   said Colin in awe
[2087]11655   Yes, said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew-drenched grass
[2088]4772    And there's the Keeper, too
[2089]29    He guards the goal posts
[2090]5038    That's it, really
[2091]22546   But Colin didn't stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice, I'll go and get a good seat, Harry
[2092]93   and hurried off to the stands
[2093]859   The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room
[2094]853    Wood was the only person who looked truly awake
[2095]1997    Fred and George Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and touslehaired, next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her
[2096]290    Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them
[2097]5845   There you are, Harry, what kept you
[2098]5167   said Wood briskly
[2099]2304    Now, I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field, because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program, which I really think will make all the differenceWood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in different colored inks
[2100]1524    He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars
[2101]12130    As Wood launched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley's head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet's shoulder and he began to snore
[2102]521   The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was another board under that, and a third under that one
[2103]5839    Harry sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on
[2104]11693   So, said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle
[2105]64    Is that clear
[2106]42   Any questions
[2107]6997  I've got a question, Oliver, said George, who had woken with a start
[2108]2796    Why couldn't you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake
[2109]2568  Wood wasn't pleased
[2110]5258   Now, listen here, you lot, he said, glowering at them all
[2111]494    We should have won the Quidditch cup last year
[2112]202    We're easily the best team
[2113]5875    But unfortunately - owing to circumstances beyond our control-Harry shifted guiltily in his seat
[2114]890    He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years
[2115]576   Wood took a moment to regain control of himself
[2116]79    Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him
[2117]5528   So this year, we train harder than ever before Okay, let's go and put our new theories into practice
[2118]636   Wood shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms
[2119]248    Stiff-legged and still yawning, his team followed
[2120]987   They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium
[2121]9996    As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the stands
[2122]2431   Aren't you finished yet
[2123]2135   called Ron incredulously
[2124]18114   Haven't even started, said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall
[2125]4981    Wood's been teaching us new moves
[2126]343   He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into the air
[2127]6262    The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more effectively than Wood's long talk
[2128]475    It felt wonderful to be back on the Quidditch field
[2129]1442    He soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing Fred and George
[2130]4904   What's that funny clicking noise
[2131]653   called Fred as they hurtled around the corner
[2132]6426   Harry looked into the stands
[2133]714    Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium
[2134]6544   Look this way, Harry
[2135]355   This way
[2136]50   he cried shrilly
[2137]4750   Who's that
[2138]5514   said Fred
[2139]6687   No idea, Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from Colin
[2140]5239   What's going on
[2141]5347   said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the air toward them
[2142]5075    Why's that first year taking pictures
[2143]3675   I don't like it
[2144]558    He could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training program
[2145]15916   He's in Gryffindor, said Harry quickly
[2146]8654   And the Slytherins don't need a spy, Oliver, said George
[2147]297   What makes you say that
[2148]5151   said Wood testily
[2149]5641   Because they're here in person, said George, pointing
[2150]825   Several people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks in their hands
[2151]3042   I don't believe it
[2152]88   Wood hissed in outrage
[2153]93    I booked the field for today
[2154]567   We'll see about this
[2155]531  Wood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted
[2156]6659    Harry, Fred, and George followed
[2157]11   Flint
[2158]255   Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain
[2159]596    This is our practice time
[2160]696   We got up specially
[2161]64   You can clear off now
[2162]91  Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood
[2163]1517    He had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied, Plenty of room for all of us, Wood
[2164]590   Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too
[2165]850    There were no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man
[2166]29   But I booked the field
[2167]5198   said Wood, positively spitting with rage
[2168]7    I booked it
[2169]5148  Ah, said Flint
[2170]2705    But I've got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape
[2171]5501    I, Professor S
[2172]1399    Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker'
[2173]1539    You've got a new Seeker
[2174]5154   said Wood, distracted
[2175]0    Where
[2176]1289  And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face
[2177]501    It was Draco Malfoy
[2178]7645   Aren't you Lucius Malfoy's son
[2179]6569   said Fred, looking at Malfoy with dislike
[2180]10381   Funny you should mention Draco's father, said Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly
[2181]5328    Let me show you the generous gift he's made to the Slytherin team
[2182]129   All seven of them held out their broomsticks
[2183]772    Seven highly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors'noses in the early morning sun
[2184]10   Very latest model
[2185]5603    Only came out last month, said Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own
[2186]322    I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount
[2187]1111    As for the old Cleansweeps - he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives - sweeps the board with them
[2188]1382   None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment
[2189]1071    Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits
[2190]5916   Oh, look, said Flint
[2191]23    A field invasion
[2192]4144   Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on
[2193]4784   What's happening
[2194]8090   Ron asked Harry
[2195]2400    Why aren't you playing
[2196]4932   And what's he doing here
[2197]1619  He was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes
[2198]6912   I'm the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley, said Malfoy, smugly
[2199]10530    Everyone's just been admiring the brooms my father's bought our team
[2200]2341   Ron gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him
[2201]2704   Good, aren't they
[2202]5544   said Malfoy smoothly
[2203]644    But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too
[2204]69    You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid for them
[2205]309   The Slytherin team howled with laughter
[2206]7414   At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in, said Hermione sharply
[2207]715     They got in on pure talent
[2208]6176   The smug look on Malfoy's face flickered
[2209]699   No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood, he spat
[2210]12045   Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words
[2211]1500    Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, How dare you
[2212]4143   and Ron plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling, You'll pay for that one, Malfoy
[2213]5528   and pointed it furiously under Flint's arm at Malfoys face
[2214]8067   A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron's wand, hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass
[2215]2002   Ron
[2216]2002   Ron
[2217]557   Are you all right
[2218]1625   squealed Hermione
[2219]2762   Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out
[2220]513    Instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap
[2221]301   The Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter
[2222]247    Flint was doubled up, hanging onto his new broomstick for support
[2223]590    Malfoy was on all fours, banging the ground with his fist
[2224]2384    The Gryffindors were gathered around Ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs
[2225]367    Nobody seemed to want to touch him
[2226]25798   We'd better get him to Hagrid's, it's nearest, said Harry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms
[2227]5875   What happened, Harry
[2228]143   What happened
[2229]18   Is he ill
[2230]2314   But you can cure him, can't you
[2231]504   Colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field
[2232]2284    Ron gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front
[2233]5187   Oooh, said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera
[2234]5783    Can you hold him still, Harry
[2235]403  Get out of the way, Colin
[2236]10901   said Harry angrily
[2237]3854    He and Hermione supported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest
[2238]13883   Nearly there, Ron, said Hermione as the gamekeeper's cabin came into view
[2239]10827    You'll be all right in a minute - almost there-They were within twenty feet of Hagrid's house when the front door opened, but it wasn't Hagrid who emerged
[2240]779    Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out
[2241]7844   Quick, behind here, Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearby bush
[2242]1753    Hermione followed, somewhat reluctantly
[2243]5806   It's a simple matter if you know what you're doing
[2244]1096   Lockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid
[2245]1099    If you need help, you know where I am
[2246]988   I'll let you have a copy of my book
[2247]4308    I'm surprised you haven't already got one - I'll sign one tonight and send it over
[2248]354    Well, good-bye
[2249]503   And he strode away toward the castle
[2250]14150   Harry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled Ron out of the bush and up to Hagrid's front door
[2251]64    They knocked urgently
[2252]1749   Hagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression brightened when he saw who it was
[2253]13238   Bin wonderin'when you'd come ter see me - come in, come in - thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again-Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily in the other
[2254]18090    Hagrid didn't seem perturbed by Ron's slug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he lowered Ron into a chair
[2255]5510   Better out than in, he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in front of him
[2256]2048    Get em all up, Ron
[2257]17361   I don't think there's anything to do except wait for it to stop, said Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin
[2258]6352    That's a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand-Hagrid was bustling around making them tea
[2259]5809    His boarhound, Fang, was slobbering over Harry
[2260]1858   What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid
[2261]11013   Harry asked, scratching Fang's ears
[2262]1226   Givin'me advice on gettin'kelpies out of a well, growled Hagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot
[2263]2138    Like I don'know
[2264]10    An'bangin'on about some banshee he banished
[2265]733    If one word of it was true, I'll eat my kettle
[2266]7423   It was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts'teacher, and Harry looked at him in surprise
[2267]8127    Hermione, however, said in a voice somewhat higher than usual, I think you're being a bit unfair
[2268]10442    Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job-He was the on'y man for the job, said Hagrid, offering them a plate of treacle fudge, while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin
[2269]244    An'I mean the on'y one
[2270]665    Gettin'very difficult ter find anyone fer the Dark Arts job
[2271]2841    People aren't too keen ter take it on, see
[2272]5465    They're startin'ter think it's jinxed
[2273]5149    No one's lasted long fer a while now
[2274]8570    So tell me, said Hagrid, jerking his head at Ron
[2275]195    Who was he tryin'ter curse
[2276]3459  Malfoy called Hermione something - it must've been really bad, because everyone went wild
[2277]7871   It was bad, said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty
[2278]3422    Malfoy called her Mudblood,'Hagrid-Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance
[2279]1337    Hagrid looked outraged
[2280]400   He didn'
[2281]1647   he growled at Hermione
[2282]5753   He did, she said
[2283]3757    But I don't know what it means
[2284]8499    I could tell it was really rude, of course-It's about the most insulting thing he could think of, gasped Ron, coming back up
[2285]6258    Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born - you know, non-magic parents
[2286]7279    There are some wizards - like Malfoy's family - who think they're better than everyone else because they're what people call pure-blood
[2287]930    He gave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand
[2288]3911    He threw it into the basin and continued, I mean, the rest of us know it doesn't make any difference at all
[2289]6732    Look at Neville Longbottom - he's pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up
[2290]11633   An'they haven't invented a spell our Hermione can'do, said Hagrid proudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta
[2291]12517   It's a disgusting thing to call someone, said Ron, wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand
[2292]125    Dirty blood, see
[2293]198    Common blood
[2294]4761    It's ridiculous
[2295]454    Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway
[2296]3832    If we hadn't married Muggles we'd've died out
[2297]126   He retched and ducked out of sight again
[2298]8938   Well, I don'blame yeh fer tryin'ter curse him, Ron, said Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin
[2299]1052    Bu'maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired
[2300]2798    Spect Lucius Malfoy would've come marchin'up ter school if yeh'd cursed his son
[2301]90    Least yer not in trouble
[2302]17440   Harry would have pointed out that trouble didn't come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn't; Hagrid's treacle fudge had cemented his jaws together
[2303]11927   Harry, said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought
[2304]312    Gotta bone ter pick with yeh
[2305]1731    I've heard you've bin givin'out signed photos
[2306]3564    How come I haven't got one
[2307]5863  Furious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart
[2308]5199   I have not been giving out signed photos, he said hotly
[2309]5999    If Lockhart's still spreading that around-But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing
[2310]12039   I'm on'y jokin', he said, patting Harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table
[2311]3104    I knew yeh hadn't really
[2312]1240    I told Lockhart yeh didn'need teh
[2313]52    Yer more famous than him without tryin'
[2314]14451   Bet he didn't like that, said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin
[2315]8086   Don'think he did, said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling
[2316]1447    An'then I told him I'd never read one o'his books an'he decided ter go
[2317]2208    Treacle fudge, Ron
[2318]2109   he added as Ron reappeared
[2319]7150   No thanks, said Ron weakly
[2320]204    Better not risk it
[2321]14358   Come an'see what I've bin growin', said Hagrid as Harry and Hermione finished the last of their tea
[2322]11749   In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid's house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen
[2323]251    Each was the size of a large boulder
[2324]2368   Gettin'on well, aren't they
[2325]5778   said Hagrid happily
[2326]136    Fer the Halloween feast should be big enough by then
[2327]700   What've you been feeding them
[2328]10818   said Harry
[2329]1477   Hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone
[2330]13421   Well, I've bin givin'them - you know - a bit o'help-Harry noticed Hagrid's flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin
[2331]13126    Harry had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong impression that Hagrid's old school wand was concealed inside it
[2332]3507    Hagrid wasn't supposed to use magic
[2333]7288    He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why - any mention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed
[2334]114   An Engorgement Charm, I suppose
[2335]6755   said Hermione, halfway between disapproval and amusement
[2336]1082    Well, you've done a good job on them
[2337]17925   That's what yer little sister said, said Hagrid, nodding at Ron
[2338]106    Met her jus'yesterday
[2339]7140    Hagrid looked sideways at Harry, his beard twitching
[2340]5649    Said she was jus'lookin'round the grounds, but I reckon she was hopin'she might run inter someone else at my house
[2341]5736    He winked at Harry
[2342]12084    If yeh ask me, she wouldn'say no ter a signed-Oh, shut up, said Harry
[2343]2198    Ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs
[2344]81   Watch it
[2345]3127   Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious pumpkins
[2346]6531   It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle fudge since dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat
[2347]8564    They said good-bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs
[2348]2254   They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out, There you are, Potter - Weasley
[2349]1674    Professor McGonagall was walking toward them, looking stern
[2350]96    You will both do your detentions this evening
[2351]933   What're we doing, Professor
[2352]7132   said Ron, nervously suppressing a burp
[2353]918   You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr
[2354]6201    Filch, said Professor McGonagall
[2355]862    And no magic, Weasley - elbow grease
[2356]2012   Ron gulped
[2357]392    Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student in the school
[2358]7618   And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan mail, said Professor McGonagall
[2359]3887   Oh n- Professor, can't I go and do the trophy room, too
[2360]10851   said Harry desperately
[2361]6203   Certainly not, said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows
[2362]995    Professor Lockhart requested you particularly
[2363]187    Eight o'clock sharp, both of you
[2364]10991   Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-school-rules sort of expression
[2365]14220    Harry didn't enjoy his shepherd's pie as much as he'd thought
[2366]3690    Both he and Ron felt they'd got the worse deal
[2367]8002   Filch'll have me there all night, said Ron heavily
[2368]212    No magic
[2369]446   There must be about a hundred cups in that room
[2370]896    I'm no good at Muggle cleaning
[2371]11443   I'd swap anytime, said Harry hollowly
[2372]834    I've had loads of practice with the Dursleys
[2373]19007    Answering Lockhart's fan mail he'll be a nightmareSaturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no time, it was five minutes to eight, and Harry was dragging his feet along the second-floor corridor to Lockhart's office
[2374]101    He gritted his teeth and knocked
[2375]804   The door flew open at once
[2376]223    Lockhart beamed down at him
[2377]4802   Ah, here's the scalawag
[2378]5086   he said
[2379]7136    Come in, Harry, come in-Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of Lockhart
[2380]29    He had even signed a few of them
[2381]460    Another large pile lay on his desk
[2382]14   You can address the envelopes
[2383]6302   Lockhart told Harry, as though this was a huge treat
[2384]4913   This first one's to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her - huge fan of mine-The minutes snailed by
[2385]12511    Harry let Lockhart's voice wash over him, occasionally saying, Mmm and Right and Yeah
[2386]11580    Now and then he caught a phrase like, Fame's a fickle friend, Harry, or Celebrity is as celebrity does, remember that
[2387]828   The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart watching him
[2388]12028    Harry moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out Veronica Smethley's address
[2389]12880    It must be nearly time to leave , Harry thought miserably, please let it be nearly timeAnd then he heard something - something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and Lockhart's prattle about his fans
[2390]1754   It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom
[2391]7324   Come come to me Let me rip you Let me tear you Let me kill youHarry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica Smethley's street
[2392]0   What
[2393]5222   he said loudly
[2394]771   I know
[2395]5290   said Lockhart
[2396]193    Six solid months at the top of the best-seller list
[2397]48   Broke all records
[2398]10836  No, said Harry frantically
[2399]539    That voice
[2400]95  Sorry
[2401]5909   said Lockhart, looking puzzled
[2402]539    What voice
[2403]8522  That - that voice that said - didn't you hear it
[2404]6662  Lockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment
[2405]5876   What are you talking about, Harry
[2406]409   Perhaps you're getting a little drowsy
[2407]1271   Great Scott - look at the time
[2408]861   We've been here nearly four hours
[2409]8323   I'd never have believed it - the time's flown, hasn't it
[2410]8513  Harry didn't answer
[2411]5626    He was straining his ears to hear the voice again, but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn't expect a treat like this every time he got detention
[2412]6179    Feeling dazed, Harry left
[2413]782   It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty
[2414]6075    Harry went straight up to the dormitory
[2415]4451    Ron wasn't back yet
[2416]6808    Harry pulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited
[2417]3629    Half an hour later, Ron arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room
[2418]280   My muscles have all seized up, he groaned, sinking on his bed
[2419]282    Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch cup before he was satisfied
[2420]336    And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award for Services to the School
[2421]438    Took ages to get the slime off How was it with Lockhart
[2422]9579  Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Seamus, Harry told Ron exactly what he had heard
[2423]7916   And Lockhart said he couldn't hear it
[2424]7088   said Ron
[2425]5785    Harry could see him frowning in the moonlight
[2426]1266    D'you think he was lying
[2427]4402   But I don't get it - even someone invisible would've had to open the door
[2428]11872   I know, said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the canopy above him
[2429]2941    I don't get it either

[2448]702    Lionfish 11/Nov/2007     Chapter Eight     The Deathday PartyContents  Prev Chapter  Next Chapter  
[2449]278     October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle
[2450]505    Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students
[2451]529    Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward
[2452]1878    Ginny Weasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy
[2453]940    The steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire
[2454]6422    Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid's pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds
[2455]11095    Oliver Wood's enthusiasm for regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud
[2456]2604   Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn't been a happy practice session
[2457]1448    Fred and George, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones
[2458]1220    They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like missiles
[2459]7648    As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was
[2460]15037    Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under his breath, don't fulfill their requirements half an inch, if thatHello, Nick, said Harry
[2461]6188   Hello, hello, said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round
[2462]888    He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed
[2463]6891    He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside
[2464]6497   You look troubled, young Potter, said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet
[2465]10818   So do you, said Harry
[2466]11336   Ah, Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, a matter of no importance It's not as though I really wanted to join Thought I'd apply, but apparently I don't fulfill requirements'-In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face
[2467]3751   But you would think, wouldn't you, he erupted suddenly, pulling the letter back out of his pocket, that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt
[2468]11615  Oh - yes, said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree
[2469]1883   I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule
[2470]943    However - Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter open and read furiously:We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies
[2471]1045    You will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo
[2472]37    It is with the greatest regret, therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements
[2473]269    With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore
[2474]715   'Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away
[2475]6118   Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry
[2476]11263   Most people would think that's good and beheaded, but oh, no, it's not enough for Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore
[2477]10570   Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, So - what's bothering you
[2478]0   Anything I can do
[2479]10818  No, said Harry
[2480]11825    Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly-The rest of Harry's sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from somewhere near his ankles
[2481]2030    He looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes
[2482]369    It was Mrs
[2483]518    Norris, the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students
[2484]11858   You'd better get out of here, Harry, said Nick quickly
[2485]8662    Filch isn't in a good mood - he's got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five
[2486]17187    He's been cleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place-Right, said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs
[2487]184    Norris, but not quickly enough
[2488]12147    Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry's right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-breaker
[2489]702    There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose was unusually purple
[2490]4   Filth
[2491]11520   he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry's Quidditch robes
[2492]13    Mess and muck everywhere
[2493]1025   I've had enough of it, I tell you
[2494]495   Follow me, Potter
[2495]7000  So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor
[2496]11298    Harry had never been inside Filch's office before; it was a place most students avoided
[2497]718    The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling
[2498]244    A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place
[2499]6140    Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels, Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever punished
[2500]1462    Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves
[2501]5223    A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch's desk
[2502]1490    It was common knowledge that he was always begging Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling
[2503]1204   Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment
[2504]7440   Dung, he muttered furiously, great sizzling dragon bogies frog brains rat intestines I've had enough of it make an example where's the form yesHe retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot
[2505]6193   Name Harry Potter
[2506]208    CrimeIt was only a bit of mud
[2507]10818   said Harry
[2508]9942   It's only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing
[2509]605   shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose
[2510]6277     Crime befouling the castle suggested sentenceDabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall
[2511]488   But as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG
[2512]259   on the ceiling of the office, which made the oil lamp rattle
[2513]55   PEEVES
[2514]258   Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage
[2515]1690    I'll have you this time, I'll have you
[2516]6519  And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the office, Mrs
[2517]43    Norris streaking alongside him
[2518]379   Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress
[2519]11995    Harry didn't much like Peeves, but couldn't help feeling grateful for his timing
[2520]7217    Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and it sounded as though he'd wrecked something very big this time) would distract Filch from Harry
[2521]6817   Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk
[2522]804    There was only one thing on it apart from his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver lettering on the front
[2523]9861    With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn't on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read:KwikspellA Correspondence Course in Beginners'Magic
[2524]6508   Intrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside
[2525]5721    More curly silver writing on the front page said:Feel out of step in the world of modern magic
[2526]184   Find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells
[2527]4   Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork
[2528]73  There is an answer
[2529]506  Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn course
[2530]168    Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell method
[2531]99  Madam Z
[2532]218    Nettles of Topsham writes:I had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke
[2533]357   Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution
[2534]629  Warlock D
[2535]59    J
[2536]609    Prod of Didsbury says:My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak
[2537]51   Thank you, Kwikspell
[2538]10632  Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope's contents
[2539]1377    Why on earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course
[2540]3502   Did this mean he wasn't a proper wizard
[2541]7908   Harry was just reading Lesson One: Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips) when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was coming back
[2542]7565    Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened
[2543]729   Filch was looking triumphant
[2544]71   That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable
[2545]484   he was saying gleefully to Mrs
[2546]29    Norris
[2547]14173    We'll have Peeves out this time, my sweet-His eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, Harry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started
[2548]5675   Filch's pasty face went brick red
[2549]5779    Harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury
[2550]362    Filch hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it into a drawer
[2551]795   Have you - did you read -
[2552]2   he sputtered
[2553]5900   No, Harry lied quickly
[2554]5048   Filch's knobbly hands were twisting together
[2555]12680   If I thought you'd read my private -not that it's mine - for a friend - be that as it may - however-Harry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder
[2556]3875    His eyes were popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan scarf didn't help
[2557]12096   Very well - go - and don't breathe a word - not that - however, if you didn't read - go now, I have to write up Peeves'report - go-Amazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back upstairs
[2558]5459    To escape from Filch's office without punishment was probably some kind of school record
[2559]5732   Harry
[2560]5732   Harry
[2561]770   Did it work
[2562]536  Nearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom
[2563]6705    Behind him, Harry could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height
[2564]10890   I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch's office, said Nick eagerly
[2565]394    Thought it might distract him-Was that you
[2566]10821   said Harry gratefully
[2567]3057    Yeah, it worked, I didn't even get detention
[2568]121    Thanks, Nick
[2569]255  They set off up the corridor together
[2570]21993    Nearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed, was still holding Sir Patrick's rejection letterI wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt, Harry said
[2571]6833    Nearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right through him
[2572]3192    He wished he hadn't; it was like stepping through an icy shower
[2573]5194   But there is something you could do for me, said Nick excitedly
[2574]8519    Harry - would I be asking too much - but no, you wouldn't want-What is it
[2575]10818   said Harry
[2576]6005    Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday, said Nearly Headless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified
[2577]12013   Oh, said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this
[2578]557    Right
[2579]560   I'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons
[2580]175    Friends will be coming from all over the country
[2581]8    It would be such an honor if you would attend
[2582]372    Mr
[2583]1878    Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, of course - but I daresay you'd rather go to the school feast
[2584]5823   He watched Harry on tenterhooks
[2585]12198   No, said Harry quickly, I'll come-My dear boy
[2586]6217   Harry Potter, at my deathday party
[2587]1430   And - he hesitated, looking excited - do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me
[2588]11035  Of - of course, said Harry
[2589]279   Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him
[2590]24   A deathday party
[2591]15044   said Hermione keenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in the common room
[2592]4276    I bet there aren't many living people who can say they've been to one of those - it'll be fascinating
[2593]555  Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died
[2594]7271   said Ron, who was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy
[2595]1373    Sounds dead depressing to meRain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful
[2596]2738    The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander
[2597]1444    Fred had rescued the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people
[2598]10853   Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room
[2599]16833    The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry's mind
[2600]6413   By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party
[2601]7559    The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid's vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment
[2602]7409   A promise is a promise, Hermione reminded Harry bossily
[2603]5731    You said you'd go to the deathday party
[2604]10750   So at seven o'clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons
[2605]6266   The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick's party had been lined with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces
[2606]328    The temperature dropped with every step they took
[2607]7109    As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard
[2608]98   Is that supposed to be music
[2609]2125   Ron whispered
[2610]1471    They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes
[2611]5239   My dear friends, he said mournfully
[2612]474    Welcome, welcome so pleased you could comeHe swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside
[2613]106   It was an incredible sight
[2614]1303    The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform
[2615]386    A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles
[2616]882    Their breath rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer
[2617]457   Shall we have a look around
[2618]6037   Harry suggested, wanting to warm up his feet
[2619]7669   Careful not to walk through anyone, said Ron nervously, and they set off around the edge of the dance floor
[2620]722    They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead
[2621]8910    Harry wasn't surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts
[2622]7106   Oh, no, said Hermione, stopping abruptly
[2623]3617    Turn back, turn back, I don't want to talk to Moaning Myrtle-Who
[2624]10974   said Harry as they backtracked quickly
[2625]7045   She haunts one of the toilets in the girls'bathroom on the first floor, said Hermione
[2626]31   She haunts a toilet
[2627]292  Yes
[2628]5388    It's been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place
[2629]5712    I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you-Look, food
[2630]7088   said Ron
[2631]901   On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black velvet
[2632]486    They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks, horrified
[2633]224    The smell was quite disgusting
[2634]9136    Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words,SIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTONDIED 31ST OCTOBER, 1492Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon
[2635]60   Can you taste it if you walk though it
[2636]6088   Harry asked him
[2637]5478   Almost, said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away
[2638]8429   I expect they've let it rot to give it a stronger flavor, said Hermione knowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis
[2639]0   Can we move
[2640]7250   I feel sick, said Ron
[2641]1408   They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them
[2642]10921   Hello, Peeves, said Harry cautiously
[2643]149   Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent
[2644]918    He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face
[2645]1   Nibbles
[2646]5195   he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus
[2647]6741   No thanks, said Hermione
[2648]6142   Heard you talking about poor Myrtle, said Peeves, his eyes dancing
[2649]99     Rude you was about poor Myrtle
[2650]414    He took a deep breath and bellowed, OY
[2651]57   MYRTLE
[2652]11406  Oh, no, Peeves, don't tell her what I said, she'll be really upset, Hermione whispered frantically
[2653]6245    I didn't mean it, I don't mind her - er, hello, Myrtle
[2654]92   The squat ghost of a girl had glided over
[2655]6845    She had the glummest face Harry had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles
[2656]0   What
[2657]5087   she said sulkily
[2658]57   How are you, Myrtle
[2659]7297   said Hermione in a falsely bright voice
[2660]4834    It's nice to see you out of the toilet
[2661]63   Myrtle sniffed
[2662]11078   Miss Granger was just talking about you - said Peeves slyly in Myrtle's ear
[2663]9262    Just saying-Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight, said Hermione, glaring at Peeves
[2664]1702   Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously
[2665]5995   You're making fun of me, she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her small, see-through eyes
[2666]9266   No - honestly - didn't I just say how nice Myrtle's looking
[2667]14466   said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs
[2668]5153   Oh, yeah-She did-Don't lie to me, Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down her face, while Peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder
[2669]5207    D'you think I don't know what people call me behind my back
[2670]95   Fat Myrtle
[2671]95   Ugly Myrtle
[2672]99   Miserable, moaning, moping Myrtle
[2673]878  You've forgotten pimply, Peeves hissed in her ear
[2674]198   Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon
[2675]131    Peeves shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling,  Pimply
[2676]4   Pimply
[2677]7168   Oh, dear, said Hermione sadly
[2678]362   Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd
[2679]18   Enjoying yourselves
[2680]667  Oh, yes, they lied
[2681]5450   Not a bad turnout, said Nearly Headless Nick proudly
[2682]7273    The Wailing Widow came all the way up from Kent It's nearly time for my speech, I'd better go and warn the orchestraThe orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment
[2683]930    They, and everyone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting horn sounded
[2684]5725   Oh, here we go, said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly
[2685]369   Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a headless horseman
[2686]11631    The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too, but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick's face
[2687]380   The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing and plunging
[2688]960    At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the horn
[2689]1864    The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick, squashing his head back onto his neck
[2690]81   Nick
[2691]47   he roared
[2692]0    How are you
[2693]534   Head still hanging in there
[2694]633  He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder
[2695]5212   Welcome, Patrick, said Nick stiffly
[2696]33   Live uns
[2697]15521   said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd howled with laughter)
[2698]5380   Very amusing, said Nearly Headless Nick darkly
[2699]3173   Don't mind Nick
[2700]5797   shouted Sir Patrick's head from the floor
[2701]2828    Still upset we won't let him join the Hunt
[2702]17898   But I mean to say - look at the fellow-I think, said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, Nick's very - frightening and - er-Ha
[2703]5471   yelled Sir Patrick's head
[2704]667   Bet he asked you to say that
[2705]10118  If I could have everyone's attention, it's time for my speech
[2706]5580   said Nearly Headless Nick loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight
[2707]583   My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrowBut nobody heard much more
[2708]2019    Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch
[2709]6467    Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his audience, but gave up as Sir Patrick's head went sailing past him to loud cheers
[2710]5885   Harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry
[2711]5000   I can't stand much more of this, Ron muttered, his teeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor
[2712]10819   Let's go, Harry agreed
[2713]1731   They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles
[2714]7918   Pudding might not be finished yet, said Ron hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall
[2715]6003   And then Harry heard it
[2716]6601    rip tear killIt was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in Lockhart's office
[2717]1061   He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his might, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway
[2718]5732   Harry, what're you -
[2719]5446  It's that voice again - shut up a minute- soo hungry for so longListen
[2720]14612   said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching him
[2721]1228    kill time to killThe voice was growing fainter
[2722]6502    Harry was sure it was moving away - moving upward
[2723]679    A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward
[2724]2910   Was it a phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn't matter
[2725]1027  This way, he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance hall
[2726]1201    It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall
[2727]9732    Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him
[2728]5739   Harry, what're we-SHH
[2729]5829  Harry strained his ears
[2730]1379    Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter still, he heard the voice:  I smell blood I SMELL BLOOD
[2731]5388  His stomach lurched-It's going to kill someone
[2732]24709   he shouted, and ignoring Ron's and Hermione's bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps - Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione panting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last, deserted passage
[2733]5732   Harry, what was that all about
[2734]7638   said Ron, wiping sweat off his face
[2735]4730    I couldn't hear anythingBut Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor
[2736]457   Look
[2737]222   Something was shining on the wall ahead
[2738]212    They approached slowly, squinting through the darkness
[2739]696    Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches
[2740]164   THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEENOPENED
[2741]5024    ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWAREWhat's that thing - hanging underneath
[2742]7653   said Ron, a slight quiver in his voice
[2743]10909   As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped - there was a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it
[2744]85    All three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash
[2745]369   Mrs
[2746]4913    Norris, the caretaker's cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket
[2747]760    She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring
[2748]2780   For a few seconds, they didn't move
[2749]12158    Then Ron said, Let's get out of here
[2750]8421   Shouldn't we try and help - Harry began awkwardly
[2751]7103   Trust me, said Ron
[2752]3276    We don't want to be found here
[2753]44   But it was too late
[2754]1223    A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that the feast had just ended
[2755]2191    From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends
[2756]657   The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat
[2757]10257    Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight
[2758]176   Then someone shouted through the quiet
[2759]35   Enemies of the Heir, beware
[2760]580   You'll be next, Mudbloods
[2761]501  It was Draco Malfoy
[2762]1537    He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat

[2773]695    Then he saw Mrs
[2774]760    Norris and fell back, clutching his face in horror

[2788]1155  Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other teachers
[2789]9992    In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, and Hermione and detached Mrs
[2790]40    Norris from the torch bracket
[2791]5643   Come with me, Argus, he said to Filch
[2792]372    You, too, Mr
[2793]833    Potter, Mr
[2794]750    Weasley, Miss Granger
[2795]377   Lockhart stepped forward eagerly
[2796]7285   My office is nearest, Headmaster - just upstairs - please feel free-Thank you, Gilderoy, said Dumbledore
[2797]501   The silent crowd parted to let them pass
[2798]3169    Lockhart, looking excited and important, hurried after Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall and Snape
[2799]11661   As they entered Lockhart's darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers
[2800]613    The real Lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back
[2801]1265    Dumbledore lay Mrs
[2802]198    Norris on the polished surface and began to examine her
[2803]9840    Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight, watching
[2804]6538   The tip of Dumbledore's long, crooked nose was barely an inch from Mrs
[2805]4785    Norris's fur
[2806]1344    He was looking at her closely through his half-moon spectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking
[2807]1642    Professor McGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed
[2808]1334    Snape loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile
[2809]325    And Lockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions
[2810]14087   It was definitely a curse that killed her - probably the Transmogrifian Torture - I've seen it used many times, so unlucky I wasn't there, I know the very countercurse that would have saved herLockhart's comments were punctuated by Filch's dry, racking sobs
[2811]1122    He was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs
[2812]725    Norris, his face in his hands
[2813]10593    Much as he detested Filch, Harry couldn't help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself If Dumbledore believed Filch, he would be expelled for sure
[2814]1460   Dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and tapping Mrs
[2815]581    Norris with his wand but nothing happened
[2816]579    She continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed
[2817]10874   I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou, said Lockhart, a series of attacks, the full story's in my autobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets, which cleared the matter up at onceThe photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked
[2818]225    One of them had forgotten to remove his hair net
[2819]837   At last Dumbledore straightened up
[2820]9985   She's not dead, Argus, he said softly
[2821]505   Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented
[2822]91   Not dead
[2823]1161   choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs
[2824]29    Norris
[2825]4773    But why's she all - all stiff and frozen
[2826]5967  She has been Petrified, said Dumbledore ("Ah
[2827]388   I thought so
[2828]5290   said Lockhart)
[2829]1    But how, I cannot sayAsk him
[2830]6481   shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face to Harry
[2831]6287   No second year could have done this, said Dumbledore firmly
[2832]1863    it would take Dark Magic of the most advanced-He did it, he did it
[2833]649   Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling
[2834]486    You saw what he wrote on the wall
[2835]6547   He found - in my office - he knows I'm a - I'm a - Filch's face worked horribly
[2836]518    He knows I'm a Squib
[2837]70   he finished
[2838]389   I never touched Mrs
[2839]29    Norris
[2840]11686   Harry said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the walls
[2841]3724    And I don't even know what a Squib is 
[2842]28   Rubbish
[2843]146   snarled Filch
[2844]425    He saw my Kwikspell letter
[2845]18046  If I might speak, Headmaster, said Snape from the shadows, and Harry's sense of foreboding increased; he was sure nothing Snape had to say was going to do him any good
[2846]6775   Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time, he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it
[2847]161    But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here
[2848]163    Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all
[2849]2487   Why wasn't he at the Halloween feast
[2850]9394  Harry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party
[2851]995    there were hundreds of ghosts, they'll tell you we were there-But why not join the feast afterward
[2852]6318   said Snape, his black eyes glittering in the candlelight
[2853]121    Why go up to that corridor
[2854]10025  Ron and Hermione looked at Harry
[2855]18126   Because - because - Harry said, his heart thumping very fast; something told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear, because we were tired and wanted to go to bed, he said
[2856]3   Without any supper
[2857]6214   said Snape, a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face
[2858]3690    I didn't think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties
[2859]9923   We weren't hungry, said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble
[2860]5369   Snape's nasty smile widened
[2861]5629   I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful, he said
[2862]966    It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story
[2863]738    I personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be honest
[2864]6935   Really, Severus, said Professor McGonagall sharply, I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch
[2865]3098    This cat wasn't hit over the head with a broomstick
[2866]556    There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything wrong
[2867]7083   Dumbledore was giving Harry a searching look
[2868]6081    His twinkling light-blue gaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed
[2869]5182   Innocent until proven guilty, Severus, he said firmly
[2870]1183   Snape looked furious
[2871]776   So did Filch
[2872]50   My cat has been Petrified
[2873]526   he shrieked, his eyes popping
[2874]346    I want to see some punishment
[2875]6051  We will be able to cure her, Argus, said Dumbledore patiently
[2876]133    Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes
[2877]677    As soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that will revive Mrs
[2878]29    Norris
[2879]976   I'll make it, Lockhart butted in
[2880]69    I must have done it a hundred times
[2881]5658    I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep-Excuse me, said Snape icily
[2882]426    But I believe I am the Potions master at this school
[2883]37   There was a very awkward pause
[2884]15252   You may go, Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione
[2885]466   They went, as quickly as they could without actually running
[2886]6509    When they were a floor up from Lockhart's office, they turned into an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them
[2887]5851    Harry squinted at his friends'darkened faces
[2888]2315   D'you think I should have told them about that voice I heard
[2889]7089  No, said Ron, without hesitation
[2890]3215    Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world
[2891]16175   Something in Ron's voice made Harry ask, You do believe me, don't you
[2892]7460  Course I do, said Ron quickly
[2893]21120    But - you must admit it's weirdI know it's weird, said Harry
[2894]4950    The whole thing's weird
[2895]185    What was that writing on the wall about
[2896]5342   The Chamber Has Been Opened  What's that supposed to mean
[2897]8118  You know, it rings a sort of bell, said Ron slowly
[2898]6817    I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once might've been BillAnd what on earth's a Squib
[2899]10818   said Harry
[2900]2050   To his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger
[2901]15036   Well - it's not funny really - but as it's Filch, he said
[2902]3446    A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any magic powers
[2903]575    Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but Squibs are quite unusual
[2904]5619    If Filch's trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib
[2905]129    It would explain a lot
[2906]887    Like why he hates students so much
[2907]2348    Ron gave a satisfied smile
[2908]4757    He's bitter
[2909]50   A clock chimed somewhere
[2910]10836   Midnight, said Harry
[2911]1494    We'd better get to bed before Snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else
[2912]1144   For a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on Mrs
[2913]29    Norris
[2914]5936    Filch kept it fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might come back
[2915]6455    Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs
[2916]5157    Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone
[2917]4875    When Filch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like breathing loudly'and looking happy
[2918]1350   Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs
[2919]4784    Norris's fate
[2920]2309    According to Ron, she was a great cat lover
[2921]4556   But you haven't really got to know Mrs
[2922]2361    Norris, Ron told her bracingly
[2923]195    Honestly, we're much better off without her
[2924]5118    Ginny's lip trembled
[2925]5519    Stuff like this doesn't often happen at Hogwarts, Ron assured her
[2926]1843    They'll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time
[2927]11770    I just hope he's got time to Petrify Filch before he's expelled
[2928]2920    I'm only joking - Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched
[2929]1696   The attack had also had an effect on Hermione
[2930]2792    It was quite usual for Hermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doing almost nothing else
[2931]8813    Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did they find out
[2932]6427   Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks
[2933]3128    After a hurried lunch, he went upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch-Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming toward him
[2934]7914    Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction
[2935]8073   Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of Magic homework
[2936]1680    Professor Binns had asked for a three foot long composition on The Medieval Assembly of European Wizards
[2937]10884   I don't believe it, I'm still eight inches short said Ron furiously, letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll
[2938]11551    And Hermione's done four feet seven inches and her writing's tiny
[2939]0   Where is she
[2940]6175   asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework
[2941]7212   Somewhere over there, said Ron, pointing along the shelves
[2942]679    Looking for another book
[2943]5772    I think she's trying to read the whole library before Christmas
[2944]8536   Harry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him
[2945]121   Dunno why you care
[2946]8440    I thought he was a bit of an idiot, said Ron, scribbling away, making his writing as large as possible
[2947]2119    All that junk about Lockhart being so great-Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves
[2948]881    She looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them
[2949]13298   All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out, she said, sitting down next to Harry and Ron
[2950]4919    And there's a two-week waiting list
[2951]5656    I wish I hadn't left my copy at home, but I couldn't fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books
[2952]335   Why do you want it
[2953]10818   said Harry
[2954]7082   The same reason everyone else wants it, said Hermione, to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets
[2955]4750   What's that
[2956]10973   said Harry quickly
[2957]5558   That's just it
[2958]9144    I can't remember, said Hermione, biting her lip
[2959]11660    And I can't find the story anywhere else-Hermione, let me read your composition, said Ron desperately, checking his watch
[2960]9255   No, I won't, said Hermione, suddenly severe
[2961]1535    You've had ten days to finish it-I only need another two inches, come on-The bell rang
[2962]4259    Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic, bickering
[2963]291   History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule
[2964]1714    Professor Binns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard
[2965]7999    Ancient and shriveled, many people said he hadn't noticed he was dead
[2966]1802    He had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staff room fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since
[2967]73   Today was as boring as ever
[2968]3119    Professor Binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again
[2969]579    He had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before
[2970]1971    Hermione put up her hand
[2971]1636   Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed
[2972]186   Miss - er -
[2973]800  Granger, Professor
[2974]7837    I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets, said Hermione in a clear voice
[2975]11790   Dean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown's head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom's elbow slipped off his desk
[2976]799   Professor Binns blinked
[2977]5933   My subject is History of Magic, he said in his dry, wheezy voice
[2978]168    I deal with facts , Miss Granger, not myths and legends
[2979]1338    He cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk slipping and continued, In September of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers-He stuttered to a halt
[2980]6908    Hermione's hand was waving in the air again
[2981]66   Miss Grant
[2982]3168  Please, sir, don't legends always have a basis in fact
[2983]7541  Professor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, Harry was sure no student had ever interrupted him before, alive or dead
[2984]6359   Well, said Professor Binns slowly, yes, one could argue that, I suppose
[2985]1868    He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before
[2986]5896    However, the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational , even ludicrous tale-But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns's every word
[2987]1544    He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his
[2988]6168    Harry could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest
[2989]5574   Oh, very well, he said slowly
[2990]2128    Let me see the Chamber of SecretsYou all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age
[2991]696    The four school Houses are named after them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin
[2992]1644    They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution
[2993]593   He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued
[2994]613   For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated
[2995]16    But then disagreements sprang up between them
[2996]281    A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others
[2997]573    Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts
[2998]476    He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families
[2999]380    He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy
[3000]1052    After a while, there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left the school
[3001]2370   Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled old tortoise
[3002]5427   Reliable historical sources tell us this much, he said
[3003]198    But these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets
[3004]766    The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing
[3005]1089   Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school
[3006]919    The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic
[3007]8538   There was silence as he finished telling the story, but it wasn't the usual, sleepy silence that filled Professor Binns's classes
[3008]354    There was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him, hoping for more
[3009]1489    Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed
[3010]5496   The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course, he said
[3011]579    Naturally, the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, many times, by the most learned witches and wizards
[3012]97    It does not exist
[3013]329    A tale told to frighten the gullible
[3014]6879   Hermione's hand was back in the air
[3015]600   Sir - what exactly do you mean by the horror within'the Chamber
[3016]6758  That is believed to be some sort of monster, which the Heir of Slytherin alone can control, said Professor Binns in his dry, reedy voice
[3017]289   The class exchanged nervous looks
[3018]6523   I tell you, the thing does not exist, said Professor Binns, shuffling his notes
[3019]122    There is no Chamber and no monster
[3020]10695   But, sir, said Seamus Finnigan, if the Chamber can only be opened by Slytherin's true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would they
[3021]6021  Nonsense, O'Flaherty, said Professor Binns in an aggravated tone
[3022]15462    If a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses haven't found the thing-But, Professor, piped up Parvati Patil, you'd probably have to use Dark Magic to open it-Just because a wizard doesn't use Dark Magic doesn't mean he can't , Miss Pennyfeather, snapped Professor Binns
[3023]6693    I repeat, if the likes of Dumbledore-But maybe you've got to be related to Slytherin, so Dumbledore couldn't - began Dean Thomas, but Professor Binns had had enough
[3024]5141   That will do, he said sharply
[3025]1    It is a myth
[3026]97   It does not exist
[3027]300   There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard
[3028]177   I regret telling you such a foolish story
[3029]184   We will return, if you please, to history , to solid, believable, verifiable fact
[3030]353  And within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor
[3031]11136   I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony, Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner
[3032]582    But I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff
[3033]2643    I wouldn't be in his house if you paid me
[3034]11348    Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I'd've got the train straight back homeHermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn't say anything
[3035]950    His stomach had just dropped unpleasantly
[3036]10047   Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered putting him in Slytherin
[3037]21454    He could remember, as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he'd placed the hat on his head a year before : You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about thatBut Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House's reputation for turning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, Not Slytherin
[3038]6561   and the hat had said, Oh, well, if you're sure better be Gryffindor As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevy went past
[3039]5733   Hiya, Harry
[3040]10883  Hullo, Colin, said Harry automatically
[3041]21303   Harry - Harry - a boy in my class has been saying you're-But Colin was so small he couldn't fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the Great Hall; they heard him squeak, See you, Harry
[3042]129   and he was gone
[3043]5130   What's a boy in his class saying about you
[3044]1656   Hermione wondered
[3045]17353   That I'm Slytherin's heir, I expect, said Harry, his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch-Fletchley had run away from him at lunchtime
[3046]8078   People here'll believe anything, said Ron in disgust
[3047]292   The crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty
[3048]6384   D'you really think there's a Chamber of Secrets
[3049]3973   Ron asked Hermione
[3050]8839   I don't know, she said, frowning
[3051]3629    Dumbledore couldn't cure Mrs
[3052]713    Norris, and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be - well - human
[3053]1041   As she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened
[3054]796    They stopped and looked
[3055]1906    The scene was just as it had been that night, except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message The Chamber of Secrets has been Opened
[3056]7040   That's where Filch has been keeping guard, Ron muttered
[3057]676   They looked at each other
[3058]149    The corridor was deserted
[3059]13640   Can't hurt to have a poke around, said Harry, dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searching for clues
[3060]16   Scorch marks
[3061]5086   he said
[3062]893    Here - and here-Come and look at this
[3063]6701   said Hermione
[3064]1057    This is funnyHar ry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall
[3065]2055    Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane, where around twenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a small crack
[3066]1324    A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside
[3067]1007   Have you ever seen spiders act like that
[3068]6705   said Hermione wonderingly
[3069]12820   No, said Harry, have you, Ron
[3070]2002   Ron
[3071]790  He looked over his shoulder
[3072]2247    Ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run
[3073]4750   What's up
[3074]10818   said Harry
[3075]10832   I - don't - like - spiders, said Ron tensely
[3076]9627   I never knew that, said Hermione, looking at Ron in surprise
[3077]12009    You've used spiders in Potions loads of timesI don't mind them dead, said Ron, who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window
[3078]4844    I just don't like the way they moveHermione giggled
[3079]11910   It's not funny, said Ron, fiercely
[3080]6100    If you must know, when I was three, Fred turned my - my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick You wouldn't like them either if you'd been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs andHe broke off, shuddering
[3081]1946    Hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh
[3082]11636    Feeling they had better get off the subject, Harry said, Remember all that water on the floor
[3083]1103   Where did that come from
[3084]4755   Someone's mopped it up
[3085]12369   It was about here, said Ron, recovering himself to walk a few paces past Filch's chair and pointing
[3086]532    Level with this door
[3087]1264   He reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though he'd been burned
[3088]4836   What's the matter
[3089]10818   said Harry
[3090]9407   Can't go in there, said Ron gruffly
[3091]4815    That's a girls'toilet
[3092]11764   Oh, Ron, there won't be anyone in there, said Hermione standing up and coming over
[3093]9764    That's Moaning Myrtle's place
[3094]5963    Come on, let's have a look
[3095]1124   And ignoring the large OUT of ORDER sign, she opened the door
[3096]5971   It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set foot in
[3097]332    Under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks
[3098]842    The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders; the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges
[3099]2068   Hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall
[3100]5311    When she reached it she said, Hello, Myrtle, how are you
[3101]8389  Harry and Ron went to look
[3102]194    Moaning Myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin
[3103]12850   This is a girlsbathroom, she said, eyeing Ron and Harry suspiciously
[3104]37     They're not girls
[3105]1632   No, Hermione agreed
[3106]1158    I just wanted to show them how er - nice it is in here
[3107]588   She waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor
[3108]7797   Ask her if she saw anything, Harry mouthed at Hermione
[3109]22   What are you whispering
[3110]5320   said Myrtle, staring at him
[3111]10973   Nothing, said Harry quickly
[3112]921    We wanted to ask-I wish people would stop talking behind my back
[3113]5738   said Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears
[3114]7697    I do have feelings, you know, even if I am dead-Myrtle, no one wants to upset you, said Hermione
[3115]5789    Harry only-No one wants to upset me
[3116]5093   That's a good one
[3117]66   howled Myrtle
[3118]1186    My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death
[3119]8078  We wanted to ask you if you've seen anything funny lately, said Hermione quickly
[3120]1287    Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween
[3121]903   Did you see anyone near here that night
[3122]10818   said Harry
[3123]7644   I wasn't paying attention, said Myrtle dramatically
[3124]508    Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself
[3125]8320    Then, of course, I remembered that I'm - that I'm-Already dead, said Ron helpfully
[3126]1668   Myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend
[3127]20464   Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shrugged wearily and said, Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle Come on, let's go
[3128]11857   Harry had barely closed the door on Myrtle's gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump
[3129]2002   RON
[3130]2276  Percy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefect badge agleam, an expression of complete shock on his face
[3131]4752   That's a girlsbathroom
[3132]40   he gasped
[3133]0    What were you -
[3134]3387  Just having a look around, Ron shrugged
[3135]7049    Clues, you know-Percy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry forcefully of Mrs
[3136]636    Weasley
[3137]5578   Get - away - from - there - Perry said, striding toward them and starting to bustle them along, flapping his arms
[3138]3840    Don't you care what this looks like
[3139]7246   Coming back here while everyone's at dinner-Why shouldn't we be here
[3140]7326   said Ron hotly, stopping short and glaring at Percy
[3141]157    Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat
[3142]24462  That's what I told Ginny, said Percy fiercely, but she still seems to think you're going to be expelled, I've never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of her , all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business-You don't care about Ginny, said Ron, whose ears were now reddening
[3143]2667     You're just worried I'm going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy-Five points from Gryffindor
[3144]5311   Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect badge
[3145]130    And I hope it teaches you a lesson
[3146]785   No more detective work , or I'll write to Mum
[3147]7041  And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron's ears
[3148]10422   Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the common room that night
[3149]2351    Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his Charms homework
[3150]687    When he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment
[3151]2359    Fuming almost as much as his homework, Ron slammed The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 shut
[3152]12274    To Harry's surprise, Hermione followed suit
[3153]0   Who can it be, though
[3154]6626   she said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a conversation they had just been having
[3155]5824    Who'd want to frighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwart's
[3156]12729  Let's think, said Ron in mock puzzlement
[3157]937    Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum
[3158]2291  He looked at Hermione
[3159]2296    Hermione looked back, unconvinced
[3160]801   If you're talking about Malfoy-Of course I am
[3161]7088   said Ron
[3162]851    You heard him - You'll be next, Mudbloods
[3163]8970  '- come on, you've only got to look at his foul rat face to know it's him-Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin
[3164]6702   said Hermione skeptically
[3165]11456   Look at his family, said Harry, closing his books, too
[3166]4995    The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin; he's always boasting about it
[3167]4921    They could easily be Slytherin's descendants
[3168]4889    His father's definitely evil enough
[3169]869   They could've had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries
[3170]7088   said Ron
[3171]11695    Handing it down, father to son Well, said Hermione cautiously, I suppose it's possibleBut how do we prove it
[3172]10842   said Harry darkly
[3173]8387   There might be a way, said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy
[3174]266    Of course, it would be difficult
[3175]94    And dangerous, very dangerous
[3176]5425    We'd be breaking about fifty school rules, I expect-If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won't you
[3177]7111   said Ron irritably
[3178]7290   All right, said Hermione coldly
[3179]7041    What we'd need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it's us
[3180]17634   But that's impossible, Harry said as Ron laughed
[3181]11451   No, it's not, said Hermione
[3182]881    All we'd need would be some Polyjuice Potion
[3183]4750   What's that
[3184]12820   said Ron and Harry together
[3185]4117   Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago-D'you think we've got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape
[3186]2109   muttered Ron
[3187]55   It transforms you into somebody else
[3188]562    Think about it
[3189]74   We could change into three of the Slytherins
[3190]771    No one would know it was us
[3191]839    Malfoy would probably tell us anything
[3192]6262    He's probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him
[3193]7444   This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me, said Ron, frowning
[3194]1425    What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever
[3195]7132  It wears off after a while, said Hermione, waving her hand impatiently
[3196]216    But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult
[3197]10659    Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it's bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library
[3198]647    There was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted Section: You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher
[3199]11770    Hard to see why we'd want the book, really, said Ron, if we weren't going to try and make one of the potions
[3200]21142    I think, said Hermione, that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chanceOh, come on, no teacher's going to fall for that, said Ron
[3201]968    They'd have to be really thick  J

[3212]699    Lionfish 11/Nov/2007     Chapter Ten     The Rogue BludgerContents  Prev Chapter  Next Chapter  
[3213]1235     Since the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart had not brought live creatures to class
[3214]306    Instead, he read passages from his books to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits
[3215]13012    He usually picked Harry to help him with these reconstructions; so far, Harry had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him
[3216]6914   Harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf
[3217]3422    If he hadn't had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood, he would have refused to do it
[3218]15683   Nice loud howl, Harry - exactly - and then, if you'll believe it, I pounced - like this - slammed him to the floor - thus with one hand, I managed to hold him down - with my other, I put my wand to his throat - I then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm- he let out a piteous moan - go on, Harry - higher than that - good - the fur vanished - the fangs shrank - and he turned back into a man
[3219]218    Simple, yet effective - and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks
[3220]1234   The bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet
[3221]97   Homework - compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf
[3222]236   Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one
[3223]387  The class began to leave
[3224]9938    Harry returned to the back of the room, where Ron and Hermione were waiting
[3225]80   Ready
[3226]5839   Harry muttered
[3227]11718   Wait till everyone's gone, said Hermione nervously
[3228]13900    All rightShe approached Lockhart's desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand, Harry and Ron right behind her
[3229]1076   Er - Professor Lockhart
[3230]1621   Hermione stammered
[3231]280    I wanted to - to get this book out of the library
[3232]866    Just for background reading
[3233]759    She held out the piece of paper, her hand shaking slightly
[3234]6521    But the thing is, it's in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to sign for it - I'm sure it would help me understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms
[3235]61   Ah, Gadding with Ghouls
[3236]7170   said Lockhart, taking the note from Hermione and smiling widely at her
[3237]104    Possibly my very favorite book
[3238]8    You enjoyed it
[3239]7406  Oh, yes, said Hermione eagerly
[3240]7656    So clever, the way you trapped that last one with the tea-strainer-Well, I'm sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help, said Lockhart warmly, and he pulled out an enormous peacock quill
[3241]2757    Yes, nice, isn't it
[3242]12821   he said, misreading the revolted look on Ron's face
[3243]154    I usually save it for book-signings
[3244]1768   He scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it back to Hermione
[3245]12890   So, Harry, said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag
[3246]5089    Tomorrow's the first Quidditch match of the season, I believe
[3247]344   Gryffindor against Slytherin, is it not
[3248]218   I hear you're a useful player
[3249]15    I was a Seeker, too
[3250]859    I was asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces
[3251]3694    Still, if ever you feel the need for a little private training, don't hesitate to ask
[3252]4013    Always happy to pass on my expertise to less able playersHarry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after Ron and Hermione
[3253]8194   I don't believe it, he said as the three of them examined the signature on the note
[3254]3412    He didn't even look at the book we wanted
[3255]16597   That's because he's a brainless git, said Ron
[3256]8418    But who cares, we've got what we needed-He is not a brainless git, said Hermione shrilly as they half ran toward the library
[3257]6444   Just because he said you were the best student of the year-They dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the library
[3258]1592    Madam Pince, the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture
[3259]68   Moste Potente Potions
[3260]6324   she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the note from Hermione; but Hermione wouldn't let go
[3261]5141   I was wondering if I could keep it, she said breathlessly
[3262]8013   Oh, come on, said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it at Madam Pince
[3263]571    We'll get you another autograph
[3264]1209    Lockhart'll sign anything if it stands still long enough
[3265]533   Madam Pince held the note up to the light, as though determined to detect a forgery, but it passed the test
[3266]1629    She stalked away between the lofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and moldy-looking book
[3267]2940    Hermione put it carefully into her bag and they left, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty
[3268]5251   Five minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle's out-of-order bathroom once again
[3269]9224    Hermione had overridden Ron's objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy
[3270]143    Moaning Myrtle was crying noisily in her stall, but they were ignoring her, and she them
[3271]2013   Hermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and the three of them bent over the damp-spotted pages
[3272]114    It was clear from a glance why it belonged in the Restricted Section
[3273]1998    Some of the potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about, and there were some very unpleasant illustrations, which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head
[3274]6882   Here it is, said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed The Polyjuice Potion
[3275]686    It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people
[3276]5979    Harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces
[3277]7655   This is the most complicated potion I've ever seen, said Hermione as they scanned the recipe
[3278]155    Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass, she murmured, running her finger down the list of ingredients
[3279]4952    Well, they're easy enough, they're in the student store-cupboard, we can help ourselves Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn - don't know where we're going to get that - shredded skin of a boomslang -
[3280]1347    that'll be tricky, too and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into
[3281]22   Excuse me
[3282]7143   said Ron sharply
[3283]1067    What d'you mean, a bit of whoever we're changing into
[3284]9660   I'm drinking nothing with Crabbe's toenails in it-Hermione continued as though she hadn't heard him
[3285]9132   We don't have to worry about that yet, though, because we add those bits lastRon turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another worry
[3286]2741   D'you realize how much we're going to have to steal, Hermione
[3287]4993   Shredded skin of a boomslang, that's definitely not in the students'cupboard
[3288]5777    What're we going to do, break into Snape's private stores
[3289]4255   I don't know if this is a good ideaHermione shut the book with a snap
[3290]5658   Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine, she said
[3291]695    There were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual
[3292]4102    I don't want to break rules, you know
[3293]993    I think threatening Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion
[3294]9667    But if you don't want to find out if it's Malfoy, I'll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in
[3295]8320   I never thought Id see the day when you'd be persuading us to break rules, said Ron
[3296]1124    All right, we'll do it
[3297]24    But not toenails, okay
[3298]557  How long will it take to make, anyway
[3299]13292   said Harry as Hermione, looking happier, opened the book again
[3300]3152   Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days I'd say it'd be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients
[3301]37   A month
[3302]7088   said Ron
[3303]1006    Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggle-borns in the school by then
[3304]13566   But Hermione's eyes narrowed dangerously again, and he added swiftly, But it's the best plan we've got, so full steam ahead, I say
[3305]11719   However, while Hermione was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, It'll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow
[3306]6363   Harry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming Quidditch match
[3307]1359    He was nervous, mainly at the thought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy
[3308]370    He had never wanted to beat Slytherin so badly
[3309]2956    After half an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got up, dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where he found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all looking uptight and not speaking much
[3310]1252   As eleven o'clock approached, the whole school started to make its way down to the Quidditch stadium
[3311]404    It was a muggy sort of day with a hint of thunder in the air
[3312]10113    Ron and Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms
[3313]5920    The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to Wood's usual pre-match pep talk
[3314]474   Slytherin has better brooms than us, he began
[3315]88    No point denying it
[3316]1897    But we've got better people on our brooms
[3317]2666    We've trained harder than they have, we've been flying in all weathers -("Too true, muttered George Weasley
[3318]5065    I haven't been properly dry since August")- and we're going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his way onto their team
[3319]6201   Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry
[3320]6412   It'll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father
[3321]9312    Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying, Harry, because we've got to win today, we've got to
[3322]11266   So no pressure, Harry said Fred, winking at him
[3323]1002   As they walked out onto the pitch, a roar of noise greeted them; mainly cheers, because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to see Slytherin beaten, but the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard, too
[3324]1744    Madam Hooch, the Quidditch teacher, asked Flint and Wood to shake hands, which they did, giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary
[3325]5218   On my whistle, said Madam Hooch
[3326]249    Three two oneWith a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky
[3327]5878    Harry flew higher than any of them, squinting around for the Snitch
[3328]558   All right there, Scarhead
[3329]625   yelled Malfoy, shooting underneath him as though to show off the speed of his broom
[3330]6299   Harry had no time to reply
[3331]1412    At that very moment, a heavy black Bludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed
[3332]5830   Close one, Harry
[3333]6290   said George, streaking past him with his club in his hand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin
[3334]12583    Harry saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for Harry again
[3335]7131   Harry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hard toward Malfoy
[3336]11809    Once again, the Bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at Harry's head
[3337]6123   Harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the pitch
[3338]244    He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him
[3339]489    What was going on
[3340]2185   Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it was their job to try and unseat as many people as possibleFred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end
[3341]6580    Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might; the Bludger was knocked off course
[3342]1   Gotcha
[3343]12247   Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it was magnetically attracted to Harry, the Bludger pelted after him once more and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed
[3344]6836   It had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face, splattering onto his glasses
[3345]4164    He didn't have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say, Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero
[3346]6550   The Slytherins'superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry out of the air
[3347]7719    Fred and George were now flying so close to him on either side that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it
[3348]11228   Someone's - tampered - with - this - Bludger - Fred grunted, swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on Harry
[3349]17867   We need time out, said George, trying to signal to Wood and stop the Bludger breaking Harry's nose at the same time
[3350]826   Wood had obviously got the message
[3351]11982    Madam Hooch's whistle rang out and Harry, Fred, and George dived for the ground, still trying to avoid the mad Bludger
[3352]5239   What's going on
[3353]5574   said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled together, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered
[3354]6    We're being flattened
[3355]1065    Fred, George, where were you when that Bludger stopped Angelina scoring
[3356]11609  We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other Bludger from murdering Harry, Oliver, said George angrily
[3357]13074    Someone's fixed it - it won't leave Harry alone
[3358]2507    It hasn't gone for anyone else all game
[3359]45    The Slytherins must have done something to it
[3360]10364   But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch's office since our last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then said Wood, anxiously
[3361]172    Madam Hooch was walking toward them
[3362]6237    Over her shoulder, Harry could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction
[3363]13218   Listen, said Harry as she came nearer and nearer, with you two flying around me all the time the only way I'm going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve
[3364]565    Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one
[3365]8455   Don't be thick, said Fred
[3366]1057    It'll take your head off
[3367]6439   Wood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys
[3368]5225   Oliver, this is insane, said Alicia Spinner angrily
[3369]8586    You can't let Harry deal with that thing on his own
[3370]5928    Let's ask for an inquiryIf we stop now, we'll have to forfeit the match
[3371]10818   said Harry
[3372]1038    And we're not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger
[3373]905   Come on, Oliver, tell them to leave me alone
[3374]5634  This is all your fault, George said angrily to Wood
[3375]1039    `Get the Snitch or die trying,'what a stupid thing to tell him-Madam Hooch had joined them
[3376]108   Ready to resume play
[3377]416   she asked Wood
[3378]12228   Wood looked at the determined look on Harry's face
[3379]5643   All right, he said
[3380]7342    Fred, George, you heard Harry - leave him alone and let him deal with the Bludger on his own
[3381]116   The rain was falling more heavily now
[3382]11297    On Madam Hooch's whistle, Harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind him
[3383]5858    Higher and higher Harry climbed; he looped and swooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled
[3384]1380    Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger
[3385]10701    He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn't change direction as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood
[3386]12763   A whistling in Harry's ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction
[3387]488   Training for the ballet, Potter
[3388]7731   yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at Malfoy in hatred, he saw it - the Golden Snitch
[3389]14424    It was hovering inches above Malfoy's left ear - and Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn't seen it
[3390]7641   For an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not daring to speed toward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch
[3391]3   WHAM
[3392]520   He had stayed still a second too long
[3393]6347    The Bludger had hit him at last, smashed into his elbow, and Harry felt his arm break
[3394]9460    Dimly, dazed by the searing pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain-drenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless at his side - the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this time zooming at his face - Harry swerved out of the way, one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain: get to Malfoy
[3395]8093   Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, sneering face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear: Malfoy thought Harry was attacking him
[3396]10878   What the - he gasped, careening out of Harry's way
[3397]7918   Harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch; he felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass out
[3398]214   With a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom
[3399]974    His arm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, he heard, as though from a distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting
[3400]770    He focused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand
[3401]5117   Aha, he said vaguely
[3402]829    We've won
[3403]2   And he fainted
[3404]942   He came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with someone leaning over him
[3405]378    He saw a glitter of teeth
[3406]373   Oh, no, not you, he moaned
[3407]13636   Doesn't know what he's saying, said Lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around them
[3408]5777    Not to worry, Harry
[3409]551    I'm about to fix your arm
[3410]0   No
[3411]10818   said Harry
[3412]1583    I'll keep it like this, thanksHe tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible
[3413]414    He heard a familiar clicking noise nearby
[3414]8549   I don't want a photo of this, Colin, he said loudly
[3415]11047   Lie back, Harry, said Lockhart soothingly
[3416]8879    It's a simple charm I've used countless times-Why can't I just go to the hospital wing
[3417]10892   said Harry through clenched teeth
[3418]8848   He should really, Professor, said a muddy Wood, who couldn't help grinning even though his Seeker was injured
[3419]14637    Great capture, Harry, really spectacular, your best yet, I'd say-Through the thicket of legs around him, Harry spotted Fred and George Weasley, wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box
[3420]67    It was still putting up a terrific fight
[3421]5466   Stand back, said Lockhart, who was rolling up his jade-green sleeves
[3422]25373   No - don't - said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at Harry's arm
[3423]11153   A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry's shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips
[3424]391    It felt as though his arm was being deflated
[3425]3222    He didn't dare look at what was happening
[3426]2881    He had shut his eyes, his face turned away from his arm, but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking away madly
[3427]4526    His arm didn't hurt anymore - nor did it feel remotely like an arm
[3428]5341   Ah, said Lockhart
[3429]292    Yes
[3430]47    Well, that can sometimes happen
[3431]225    But the point is, the bones are no longer broken
[3432]5102    That's the thing to bear in mind
[3433]7073    So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah, Mr
[3434]756    Weasley, Miss Granger, would you escort him
[3435]582   - and Madam Pomfrey will be able to - er - tidy you up a bit
[3436]6963   As Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided
[3437]1524    Taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side
[3438]473    What he saw nearly made him pass out again
[3439]1817   Poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, flesh-colored rubber glove
[3440]194    He tried to move his fingers
[3441]143    Nothing happened
[3442]13142   Lockhart hadn't mended Harry's bones
[3443]14    He had removed them
[3444]2647   Madam Pomfrey wasn't at all pleased
[3445]530   You should have come straight to me
[3446]507   she raged, holding up the sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a working arm
[3447]2817    I can mend bones in a second - but growing them back-You will be able to, won't you
[3448]10851   said Harry desperately
[3449]11833   I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful, said Madam Pomfrey grimly, throwing Harry a pair of pajamas
[3450]13511    You'll have to stay the nightHermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry's bed while Ron helped him into his pajamas
[3451]407    It took a while to stuff the rubbery, boneless arm into a sleeve
[3452]1859   How can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione, eh
[3453]12866   Ron called through the curtain as he pulled Harry's limp fingers through the cuff
[3454]6262    If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked
[3455]6929   Anyone can make a mistake, said Hermione
[3456]8309    And it doesn't hurt anymore, does it, Harry
[3457]11108  No, said Harry, getting into bed
[3458]2417    But it doesn't do anything else either
[3459]333   As he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly
[3460]1989   Hermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain
[3461]485    Madam Pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro
[3462]5325   You're in for a rough night, she said, pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it to him
[3463]114    Regrowing bones is a nasty business
[3464]131   So was taking the Skele-Gro
[3465]11040    It burned Harry's mouth and throat as it went down, making him cough and splutter
[3466]9879    Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water
[3467]7790    We won, though, said Ron, a grin breaking across his face
[3468]48    That was some catch you made
[3469]14375    Malfoy's face he looked ready to killI want to know how he fixed that Bludger, said Hermione darkly
[3470]12463    We can add that to the list of questions we'll ask him when we've taken the Polyjuice Potion, said Harry, sinking back onto his pillows
[3471]5753    I hope it tastes better than this stuffIf it's got bits of Slytherins in it
[3472]8474   You've got to be joking, said Ron
[3473]1189   The door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment
[3474]6228    Filthy and soaking wet, the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see Harry
[3475]11273    Unbelievable flying, Harry, said George
[3476]2153    I've just seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy
[3477]652    Something about having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing
[3478]3202    Malfoy didn't seem too happy
[3479]18328    They had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice; they gathered around Harry's bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over, shouting, This boy needs rest, he's got thirty-three bones to regrow
[3480]0   Out
[3481]0   OUT
[3482]6134   And Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him from the stabbing pains in his limp arm
[3483]7379   Hours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His arm now felt full of large splinters
[3484]557    For a second, he thought that was what had woken him
[3485]400    Then, with a thrill of horror, he realized that someone was sponging his forehead in the dark
[3486]0   Get off
[3487]5433   he said loudly, and then, Dobby
[3488]11381  The house-elf's goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry through the darkness
[3489]660    A single tear was running down his long, pointed nose
[3490]6788   Harry Potter came back to school, he whispered miserably
[3491]6456    Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter
[3492]3114    Ah sir, why didn't you heed Dobby
[3493]9057   Why didn't Harry Potter go back home when he missed the train
[3494]11110  Harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby's sponge away
[3495]182   What're you doing here
[3496]5086   he said
[3497]1516    And how did you know I missed the train
[3498]10824  Dobby's lip trembled and Harry was seized by a sudden suspicion
[3499]0   It was you
[3500]5212   he said slowly
[3501]153    You stopped the barrier from letting us through
[3502]6350  Indeed yes, sir, said Dobby, nodding his head vigorously, ears flapping
[3503]30553    Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward - he showed Harry ten long, bandaged fingers - but Dobby didn't care, sir, for he thought Harry Potter was safe, and never did Dobby dream that Harry Potter would get to school another way
[3504]707  He was rocking backward and forward, shaking his ugly head
[3505]12128   Dobby was so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at Hogwarts, he let his master's dinner burn
[3506]242   Such a flogging Dobby never had, sirHarry slumped back onto his pillows
[3507]7959   You nearly got Ron and me expelled, he said fiercely
[3508]1561    You'd better get lost before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you
[3509]268   Dobby smiled weakly
[3510]596   Dobby is used to death threats, sir
[3511]540    Dobby gets them five times a day at home
[3512]7282   He blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore, looking so pathetic that Harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself
[3513]1026   Why d'you wear that thing, Dobby
[3514]372   he asked curiously
[3515]143   This, sir
[3516]5305   said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase
[3517]5224     Tis a mark of the house-elf's enslavement, sir
[3518]413    Dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes, sir
[3519]897    The family is careful not to pass Dobby even a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house forever
[3520]12168   Dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly, Harry Potter must go home
[3521]903   Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make-Your Bludger
[3522]10887   said Harry, anger rising once more
[3523]902    What d'you mean, your Bludger
[3524]220   You made that Bludger try and kill me
[3525]311  Not kill you, sir, never kill you
[3526]5324   said Dobby, shocked
[3527]11313    Dobby wants to save Harry Potter's life
[3528]522   Better sent home, grievously injured, than remain here sir
[3529]6794   Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to be sent home
[3530]362  Oh, is that all
[3531]10901   said Harry angrily
[3532]4167    I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces
[3533]6522  Ah, if Harry Potter only knew
[3534]292   Dobby groaned, more tears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase
[3535]491    If he knew what he means to us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we dregs of the magical world
[3536]414   Dobby remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was at the height of his powers, sir
[3537]1118   We house-elves were treated like vermin, sir
[3538]1852   Of course, Dobby is still treated like that, sir, he admitted, drying his face on the pillowcase
[3539]341    But mostly, sir, life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
[3540]27488    Harry Potter survived, and the Dark Lord's power was broken, and it was a new dawn, sir, and Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end, sit And now, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to happen, are perhaps happening already, and Dobby cannot let Harry Potter stay here now that history is to repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once more
[3541]11629   Dobby froze, horrorstruck, then grabbed Harry's water jug from his bedside table and cracked it over his own head, toppling out of sight
[3542]1106    A second later, he crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering, Bad Dobby, very bad DobbySo there is a Chamber of Secrets
[3543]5855   Harry whispered
[3544]5857    And did you say it's been opened before
[3545]543   Tell me, Dobby
[3546]10302  He seized the elf's bony wrist as Dobby's hand inched toward the water jug
[3547]698    But I'm not Muggle-born - how can I be in danger from the Chamber
[3548]1584  Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby, stammered the elf, his eyes huge in the dark
[3549]13092    Dark deeds are planned in this place, but Harry Potter must not be here when they happen - go home, Harry Potter, go home
[3550]6598    Harry Potter must not meddle in this, sir, tis too dangerous-Who is it, Dobby
[3551]16099   Harry said, keeping a firm hold on Dobby's wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again
[3552]4920    Who's opened it
[3553]726   Who opened it last time
[3554]8040  Dobby can't, sir, Dobby can't, Dobby mustn't tell
[3555]108   squealed the elf
[3556]6349    Go home, Harry Potter, go home
[3557]930  I'm not going anywhere
[3558]10837   said Harry fiercely
[3559]7783    One of my best friends is Muggle-born; she'll be first in line if the Chamber really has been opened-Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends
[3560]327   moaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy
[3561]11    So noble
[3562]2   So valiant
[3563]6679   But he must save himself, he must, Harry Potter must not-Dobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering
[3564]6003    Harry heard it, too
[3565]291    There were footsteps coming down the passageway outside
[3566]211   Dobby must go
[3567]151   breathed the elf, terrified
[3568]10911    There was a loud crack, and Harry's fist was suddenly clenched on thin air
[3569]1235    He slumped back into bed, his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer
[3570]1596   Next moment, Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap
[3571]1708    He was carrying one end of what looked like a statue
[3572]1686    Professor McGonagall appeared a second later, carrying its feet
[3573]191    Together, they heaved it onto a bed
[3574]13293   Get Madam Pomfrey, whispered Dumbledore, and Professor McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry's bed out of sight
[3575]6050    Harry lay quite still, pretending to be asleep
[3576]1818    He heard urgent voices, and then Professor McGonagall swept back into view, closely followed by Madam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress
[3577]390    He heard a sharp intake of breath
[3578]143   What happened
[3579]1291   Madam Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore, bending over the statue on the bed
[3580]5968   Another attack, said Dumbledore
[3581]94    Minerva found him on the stairs
[3582]6102   There was a bunch of grapes next to him, said Professor McGonagall
[3583]1295    We think he was trying to sneak up here to visit Potter
[3584]10829   Harry's stomach gave a horrible lurch
[3585]989    Slowly and carefully, he raised himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed
[3586]792    A ray of moonlight lay across its staring face
[3587]69   It was Colin Creevey
[3588]863    His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him, holding his camera
[3589]13   Petrified
[3590]262   whispered Madam Pomfrey
[3591]6384   Yes, said Professor McGonagall
[3592]3681    But I shudder to think If Albus hadn't been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate - who knows what might have-The three of them stared down at Colin
[3593]5774    Then Dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the camera out of Colin's rigid grip
[3594]3618   You don't think he managed to get a picture of his attacker
[3595]6143   said Professor McGonagall eagerly
[3596]3598   Dumbledore didn't answer
[3597]182    He opened the back of the camera
[3598]345   Good gracious
[3599]5225   said Madam Pomfrey
[3600]72   A jet of steam had hissed out of the camera
[3601]6224    Harry, three beds away, caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic
[3602]5234   Melted, said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly
[3603]342    All meltedWhat does this mean, Albus
[3604]1385   Professor McGonagall asked urgently
[3605]6356   It means, said Dumbledore, that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again
[3606]698   Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth
[3607]1945    Professor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore
[3608]51   But, Albus surely who
[3609]6483  The question is not who, said Dumbledore, his eyes on Colin
[3610]15721    The question is, how And from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall's shadowy face, she didn't understand this any better than he did

[3621]6063     Harry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff
[3622]11902    He sat up quickly and looked over at Colin's bed, but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday
[3623]823    Seeing that he was awake, Madam Pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers
[3624]5570   All in order, she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge left-handed
[3625]911    When you've finished eating, you may leave
[3626]12797   Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby, but they weren't there
[3627]10009    Harry left to look for them, wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren't interested in whether he had his bones back or not
[3628]8828   As Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled out of it, looking in far better spirits than last time they'd met
[3629]11216   Oh, hello, Harry, he said
[3630]441    Excellent flying yesterday, really excellent
[3631]1442    Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup - you earned fifty points
[3632]6238  You haven't seen Ron or Hermione, have you
[3633]10818   said Harry
[3634]7755   No, I haven't, said Percy, his smile fading
[3635]18053    I hope Ron's not in another girls'toilet Harry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle's bathroom
[3636]7639    He couldn't see why Ron and Hermione would be in there again, but after making sure that neither Filch nor any prefects were around, he opened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall
[3637]10359   It's me, he said, closing the door behind him
[3638]6904    There was a clunk, a splash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione's eye peering through the keyhole
[3639]5732   `Harry
[3640]5086   she said
[3641]673    You gave us such a fright - come in
[3642]4858    How's your arm
[3643]10913  Fine, said Harry, squeezing into the stall
[3644]6418    An old cauldron was perched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told Harry they had lit a fire beneath it
[3645]6382    Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires was a speciality of Hermione's
[3646]9843   We'd've come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion, Ron explained as Harry, with difficulty, locked the stall again
[3647]932    We've decided this is the safest place to hide it
[3648]7865   Harry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione interrupted
[3649]3028   We already know - we heard Professor McGonagall telling Professor Flitwick this morning
[3650]8760    That's why we decided we'd better get going-The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better, snarled Ron
[3651]1954    D'you know what I think
[3652]508   He was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin
[3653]17443   There's something else, said Harry, watching Hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion
[3654]712    Dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night
[3655]4304   Ron and Hermione looked up, amazed
[3656]9317    Harry told them everything Dobby had told him - or hadn't told him
[3657]3888    Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths open
[3658]333   The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before
[3659]6701   Hermione said
[3660]7644   This settles it, said Ron in a triumphant voice
[3661]7093    Lucius Malfoy must've opened the Chamber when he was at school here and now he's told dear old Draco how to do it
[3662]4766    It's obvious
[3663]6063    Wish Dobby'd told you what kind of monster's in there, though
[3664]6599    I want to know how come nobody's noticed it sneaking around the school
[3665]7060   Maybe it can make itself invisible, said Hermione, prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron
[3666]9880    Or maybe it can disguise itself - pretend to be a suit of armor or something - I've read about Chameleon Ghouls-You read too much, Hermione, said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches
[3667]6495    He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry
[3668]646   So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm
[3669]556    He shook his head
[3670]6503    You know what, Harry
[3671]8227   If he doesn't stop trying to save your life he's going to kill you
[3672]838   The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by Monday morning
[3673]270    The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion
[3674]513    The first years were now moving around the castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone
[3675]8963   Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up
[3676]191    They were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues
[3677]1490    They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs
[3678]1412    Weasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares
[3679]366   Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans, amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school
[3680]1375    Neville Longbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger; he was a pure-blood, and therefore unlikely to be attacked
[3681]6351   They went for Filch first, Neville said, his round face fearful
[3682]518    And everyone knows I'm almost a Squib
[3683]1877   In the second week of December Professor McGonagall came around as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at school for Christmas
[3684]10171    Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; they had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very suspicious
[3685]879    The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him
[3686]328   Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished
[3687]6002    They still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to get them was from Snape's private stores
[3688]13101    Harry privately felt he'd rather face Slytherin's legendary monster than let Snape catch him robbing his office
[3689]11912   What we need, said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon's double Potions lesson loomed nearer, is a diversion
[3690]5597    Then one of us can sneak into Snape's office and take what we need
[3691]8451    Harry and Ron looked at her nervously
[3692]3270   I think I'd better do the actual stealing, Hermione continued in a matter-of-fact tone
[3693]1528    You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and I've got a clean record
[3694]843    So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so
[3695]5777   Harry smiled feebly
[3696]5714    Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape's Potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye
[3697]740   Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons
[3698]5318    Thursday afternoon's lesson proceeded in the usual way
[3699]404    Twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients
[3700]787    Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors'work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively
[3701]14715    Draco Malfoy, who was Snape's favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say Unfair
[3702]10977   Harry's Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on more important things
[3703]7109    He was waiting for Hermione's signal, and he hardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery potion
[3704]13683    When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, Hermione caught Harry's eye and nodded
[3705]11909   Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred's Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand
[3706]128    The firework began to fizz and sputter
[3707]11703    Knowing he had only seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it landed right on target in Goyle's cauldron
[3708]5054   Goyle's potion exploded, showering the whole class
[3709]458    People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them
[3710]3869    Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate - Snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened
[3711]13228    Through the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape's office
[3712]82   Silence
[3713]82   SILENCE
[3714]527   Snape roared
[3715]9161    Anyone who has been splashed, come here for a Deflating Draft - when I find out who did this-Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon
[3716]14579    As half the class lumbered up to Snape's desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffed-up lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes bulging
[3717]5781   When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle's cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework
[3718]31    There was a sudden hush
[3719]1223   If I ever find out who threw this, Snape whispered, I shall make sure that person is expelled
[3720]6355   Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression
[3721]2001    Snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome
[3722]14885   He knew it was me, Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom
[3723]332    I could tell
[3724]2011   Hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly
[3725]5810   It'll be ready in two weeks, she said happily
[3726]15623   Snape can't prove it was you, said Ron reassuringly to Harry
[3727]0    What can he do
[3728]11418  Knowing Snape, something foul, said Harry as the potion frothed and bubbled
[3729]11749   A week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up
[3730]805    Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them over, looking excited
[3731]65   They're starting a Dueling Club
[3732]5164   said Seamus
[3733]112    First meeting tonight
[3734]8061   I wouldn't mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy one of these daysWhat, you reckon Slytherin's monster can duel
[3735]7283   said Ron, but he, too, read the sign with interest
[3736]12713   Could be useful, he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into dinner
[3737]0    Shall we go
[3738]8122  Harry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o'clock that evening they hurried back to the Great Hall
[3739]849    The long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of candles floating overhead
[3740]1326    The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school eemed to be packed beneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited
[3741]624   I wonder who'll be teaching us
[3742]6809   said Hermione as they edged into the chattering crowd
[3743]1052    Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young - maybe it'll be him
[3744]12431   As long as it's not - Harry began, but he ended on a groan: Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape, wearing his usual black
[3745]806   Lockhart waved an arm for silence and called Gather round, gather round
[3746]0   Can everyone see me
[3747]189   Can you all hear me
[3748]35   Excellent
[3749]2316  Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions - for full details, see my published works
[3750]7033   Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape, said Lockhart, flashing a wide smile
[3751]873    He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin
[3752]4462    Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry - you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him, never fear
[3753]2834  Wouldn't it be good if they finished each other off
[3754]12652   Ron muttered in Harry's ear
[3755]5272   Snape's upper lip was curling
[3756]8714    Harry wondered why Lockhart was still smiling; if Snape had been looking at him like that he'd have been running as fast as he could in the opposite direction
[3757]3609   Lockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at least, Lockhart did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas Snape jerked his head irritably
[3758]902    Then they raised their wands like swords in front of them
[3759]838   As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position, Lockhart told the silent crowd
[3760]95    On the count of three, we will cast our first spells
[3761]306    Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course
[3762]8881   I wouldn't bet on that, Harry murmured, watching Snape baring his teeth
[3763]762   One - two - three-Both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent; Snape cried: Expelliarmus
[3764]1224   There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to sprawl on the floor
[3765]490   Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered
[3766]1635    Hermione was dancing on tiptoes
[3767]5869    Do you think he's all right
[3768]76   she squealed through her fingers
[3769]9   Who cares
[3770]12820   said Harry and Ron together
[3771]562   Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet
[3772]665    His hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end
[3773]0   Well, there you have it
[3774]5109   he said, tottering back onto the platform
[3775]6282    That was a Disarming Charm - as you see, I've lost my wand - ah, thank you, Miss Brown - yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do
[3776]1541    If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy - however, I felt it would be instructive to let them seeSnape was looking murderous
[3777]5385    Possibly Lockhart had noticed, because he said, Enough demonstrating
[3778]1379   I'm going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs
[3779]2905    Professor Snape, if you'd like to help me-They moved through the crowd, matching up partners
[3780]8932    Lockhart teamed Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Snape reached Harry and Ron first
[3781]1306   Time to split up the dream team, I think, he sneered
[3782]652    Weasley, you can partner Finnigan
[3783]7902    Potter-Harry moved automatically toward Hermione
[3784]9167   I don't think so, said Snape, smiling coldly
[3785]372    Mr
[3786]876    Malfoy, come over here
[3787]5760    Let's see what you make of the famous Potter
[3788]195    And you, Miss Granger - you can partner Miss Bulstrode
[3789]464   Malfoy strutted over, smirking
[3790]7007    Behind him walked a Slytherin girl who reminded Harry of a picture he'd seen in Holidays with Hags
[3791]299    She was large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively
[3792]2679    Hermione gave her a weak smile that she did not return
[3793]523   Face your partners
[3794]339   called Lockhart, back on the platform
[3795]22    And bow
[3796]1181  Hrry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off each other
[3797]124   Wands at the ready
[3798]339   shouted Lockhart
[3799]17787    When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm them - we don't want any accidents - one  two  three-Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on two": His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he'd been hit over the head with a saucepan
[3800]7497    He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted,  Rictusempra
[3801]861   A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing
[3802]5092   I said disarm only
[3803]7034   Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his knees; Harry had hit him with a Tickling Charm, and he could barely move for laughing
[3804]18242    Harry hung back, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy while he was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry's knees, choked,  Tarantallegra
[3805]10973   and the next second Harry's legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep
[3806]133   Stop
[3807]133   Stop
[3808]946   screamed Lockhart, but Snape took charge
[3809]3    Finite Incantatem
[3810]12199   he shouted; Harry's feet stopped dancing, Malfoy stopped laughing, and they were able to look up
[3811]81   A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene
[3812]8882    Both Neville and Justin were lying on the floor, panting; Ron was holding up an ashen-faced Seamus, apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done; but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving; Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whimpering in pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor
[3813]6028    Harry leapt forward and pulled Millicent off
[3814]148    It was difficult: She was a lot bigger than he was
[3815]6174   Dear, dear, said Lockhart, skittering through the crowd, looking at the aftermath of the duels
[3816]8247    Up you go, MacmillanCareful there, Miss Fawcett Pinch it hard, it'll stop bleeding in a second,I think I'd better teach you how to block unfriendly spells, said Lockhart, standing flustered in the midst of the hall
[3817]2437    He glanced at Snape, whose black eyes glinted, and looked quickly away
[3818]12895    Let's have a volunteer pair - Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley, how about you-A bad idea, Professor Lockhart, said Snape, gliding over like a large and malevolent bat
[3819]90    Longbottom causes devastation with the simplest spells
[3820]5751    We'll be sending what's left of Finch-Fletchley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox
[3821]5948    Neville's round, pink face went pinker
[3822]901    How about Malfoy and Potter
[3823]5685   said Snape with a twisted smile
[3824]146   Excellent idea
[3825]12643   said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and Malfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room
[3826]11022   Now, Harry, said Lockhart
[3827]519    When Draco points his wand at you, you do this
[3828]715   He raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action, and dropped it
[3829]2948    Snape smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up, saying, Whoops - my wand is a little overexcited-Snape moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and whispered something in his ear
[3830]452    Malfoy smirked, too
[3831]12681    Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart and said, Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again
[3832]32  Scared
[3833]3377   muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn't hear him
[3834]11145   You wish, said Harry out of the corner of his mouth
[3835]6055   Lockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder
[3836]7207    Just do what I did, Harry
[3837]430  What, drop my wand
[3838]2713  But Lockhart wasn't listening
[3839]0   Three - two - one - go
[3840]135   he shouted
[3841]1161   Malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed,  Serpensortia
[3842]639  The end of his wand exploded
[3843]7208    Harry watched, aghast, as a long black snake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, and raised itself, ready to strike
[3844]781    There were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away, clearing the floor
[3845]15498   Don't move, Potter, said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of Harry standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake
[3846]599    I'll get rid of itAllow me
[3847]339   shouted Lockhart
[3848]1710    He brandished his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack
[3849]392    Enraged, hissing furiously, it slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised itself again, fangs exposed, poised to strike
[3850]8408   Harry wasn't sure what made him do it
[3851]2481    He wasn't even aware of deciding to do it
[3852]809    All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake, Leave him alone
[3853]6828   And miraculously - inexplicably - the snake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry
[3854]6046    Harry felt the fear drain out of him
[3855]5564    He knew the snake wouldn't attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn't have explained
[3856]1617   He looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see Justin looking relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful - but certainly not angry and scared
[3857]601   What do you think you're playing at
[3858]6719   he shouted, and before Harry could say anything, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall
[3859]1578   Snape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke
[3860]16818    Snape, too, was looking at Harry in an unexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Harry didn't like it
[3861]163    He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls
[3862]443    Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes
[3863]12874   Come on, said Ron's voice in his ear
[3864]4296    Move - come on-Ron steered him out of the hall, Hermione hurrying alongside them
[3865]1027    As they went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something
[3866]13701    Harry didn't have a clue what was going on, and neither Ron nor Hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common room
[3867]12890   Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair and said, You're a Parselmouth
[3868]3040    Why didn't you tell us
[3869]441  I'm a what
[3870]10818   said Harry
[3871]3   `A Parselmouth
[3872]7088   said Ron
[3873]128    You can talk to snakes
[3874]11589  I know, said Harry
[3875]6391    I mean, that's only the second time I've ever done it
[3876]2241    I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once - long story - but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to that was before I knew I was a wizard-A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil
[3877]2072   Ron repeated faintly
[3878]0   So
[3879]10818   said Harry
[3880]382    I bet loads of people here can do it
[3881]9758   Oh, no they can't, said Ron
[3882]4864    It's not a very common gift
[3883]5824    Harry, this is bad
[3884]4842   What's bad
[3885]11238   said Harry, starting to feel quite angry
[3886]4828    What's wrong with everyone
[3887]13177   Listen, if I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin-Oh, that's what you said to it
[3888]852  What d'you mean
[3889]7680   You were there - you heard me-I heard you speaking Parseltongue, said Ron
[3890]71    Snake language
[3891]7551    You could have been saying anything - no wonder Justin panicked, you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something - it was creepy, you know-Harry gaped at him
[3892]115   I spoke a different language
[3893]2902   But - I didn't realize - how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it
[3894]2558  Ron shook his head
[3895]2277    Both he and Hermione were looking as though someone had died
[3896]8208    Harry couldn't see what was so terrible
[3897]11519   D'you want to tell me what's wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin's head
[3898]5086   he said
[3899]3762    What does it matter how I did it as long as Justin doesn't have to join the Headless Hunt
[3900]7750  It matters, said Hermione, speaking at last in a hushed voice, because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for
[3901]5131    That's why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent
[3902]11053   Harry's mouth fell open
[3903]7189   Exactly, said Ron
[3904]21000    And now the whole school's going to think you're his great-great-great-great-grandson or something-But I'm not, said Harry, with a panic he couldn't quite explain
[3905]7452   You'll find that hard to prove, said Hermione
[3906]1050    He lived about a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be
[3907]6075   Harry lay awake for hours that night
[3908]592    Through a gap in the curtains around his four-poster he watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wonderedCould he be a descendant of Salazar Slithering
[3909]8400   He didn't know anything about his father's family, after all
[3910]182    The Dursleys had always forbidden questions about his wizarding relatives
[3911]6275   Quietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue
[3912]2967    The words wouldn't come
[3913]1106    It seemed he had to be face-to-face with a snake to do it
[3914]6754   But I'm in Gryffindor, Harry thought
[3915]12213    The Sorting Hat wouldn't have put me in here if I had Slytherin bloodAh, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the Sorting Hat wanted to put you in Slytherin, don't you remember
[3916]6064  Harry turned over
[3917]2719    He'd see Justin the next day in Herbology and he'd explain that he'd been calling the snake off, not egging it on, which (he thought angrily, pummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized
[3918]2434   By next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else, now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs
[3919]98    Norris and Colin Creevey
[3920]10904   Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess
[3921]24049   For heaven's sake, Harry, said Hermione, exasperated, as one of Ron's bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board
[3922]4845    Go and find Justin if it's so important to you
[3923]6866   So Harry got up and left through the portrait hole, wondering where Justin might be
[3924]372   The castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the thick, swirling gray snow at every window
[3925]6484    Shivering, Harry walked past classrooms where lessons were taking place, catching snatches of what was happening within
[3926]1533    Professor McGonagall was shouting at someone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend into a badger
[3927]7358    Resisting the urge to take a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that Justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work, and deciding to check the library first
[3928]2971   A group of the Hufliepuffs who should have been in Herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn't seem to be working
[3929]7932    Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see that their heads were close together and they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation
[3930]2482    He couldn't see whether Justin was among them
[3931]511    He was walking toward them when something of what they were saying met his ears, and he paused to listen, hidden in the Invisibility section
[3932]674   So anyway, a stout boy was saying, I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory
[3933]10672    I mean to say, if Potter's marked him down as his next victim, it's best if he keeps a low profile for a while
[3934]6802    Of course, Justin's been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born
[3935]1041    Justin actually told him he'd been down for Eton
[3936]9968    That's not the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin's heir on the loose, is it
[3937]1119  You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie
[3938]5193   said a girl with blonde pigtails anxiously
[3939]9997   Hannah, said the stout boy solemnly, he's a Parselmouth
[3940]5289    Everyone knows that's the mark of a Dark wizard
[3941]417    Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes
[3942]302   They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue
[3943]596   There was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie went on, Remember what was written on the wall
[3944]35   Enemies of the Heir, Beware
[3945]710    Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch
[3946]10553    Next thing we know, Flich's cat's attacked
[3947]1098    That first year, Creevey, was annoying Potter at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud
[3948]5785    Next thing we know - Creevey's been attacked
[3949]10705   He always seems so nice, though, said Hannah uncertainly, and, well, he's the one who made You-Know-Who disappear
[3950]2400    He can't be all bad, can he
[3951]11489  Ernie lowered his voice mysteriously, the Hufflepuffs bent closer, and Harry edged nearer so that he could catch Ernie's words
[3952]911   No one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who
[3953]668    I mean to say, he was only a baby when it happened
[3954]6    He should have been blasted into smithereens
[3955]1556    Only a really powerful Dark wizard could have survived a curse like that
[3956]11824    He dropped his voice until it was barely more than a whisper, and said, That's probably why You- Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place
[3957]3442    Didn't want another Dark Lord competing with him
[3958]5295    I wonder what other powers Potter's been hiding
[3959]8179  Harry couldn't take anymore
[3960]262    Clearing his throat loudly, he stepped out from behind the bookshelves
[3961]8963    If he hadn't been feeling so angry, he would have found the sight that greeted him funny: Every one of the Hufflepuffs looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of him, and the color was draining out of Ernie's face
[3962]10854   Hello, said Harry
[3963]1120    I'm looking for Justin Finch-Fletchley
[3964]132   The Hufflepuffs'worst fears had clearly been confirmed
[3965]751    They all looked fearfully at Ernie
[3966]335   What do you want with him
[3967]5696   said Ernie in a quavering voice
[3968]11843   I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the Dueling Club, said Harry
[3969]5743   Ernie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, We were all there
[3970]469    We saw what happened
[3971]229   Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed off
[3972]10818   said Harry
[3973]5754   All I saw, said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as he spoke, was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin
[3974]2711   I didn't chase it at him
[3975]11492   Harry said, his voice shaking with anger
[3976]2740    It didn't even touch him
[3977]5265  It was a very near miss, said Ernie
[3978]14966    And in case you're getting ideas, he added hastily, I might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my blood's as pure as anyone's, so-- I don't care what sort of blood you've got
[3979]10837   said Harry fiercely
[3980]508    Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns
[3981]6226  I've heard you hate those Muggles you live with, said Ernie swiftly
[3982]15715   It's not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them, said Harry
[3983]1441    I'd like to see you try it
[3984]762   He turned on his heel and stormed out of the library, earning himself a reproving glare from Madam Pince, who was polishing the gilded cover of a large spellbook
[3985]6444   Harry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where he was going, he was in such a fury
[3986]730    The result was that he walked into something very large and solid, which knocked him backward onto the floor
[3987]12473   Oh, hello, Hagrid, Harry said, looking up
[3988]8708   Hagrid's face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow-covered balaclava, but it couldn't possibly be anyone else, as he filled most of the corridor in his moleskin overcoat
[3989]345    A dead rooster was hanging from one of his massive, gloved hands
[3990]5757   All righ', Harry
[3991]5240   he said, pulling up the balaclava so he could speak
[3992]2635    Why aren't yeh in class
[3993]10937  Canceled, said Harry, getting up
[3994]182    What're you doing in here
[3995]731  Hagrid held up the limp rooster
[3996]255   Second one killed this term, he explained
[3997]10051    It's either foxes or a Blood-Suckin Bugbear, an'I need the Headmaster's permission ter put a charm around the hen coop
[3998]5852   He peered more closely at Harry from under his thick, snowflecked eyebrows
[3999]512   Yeh sure yeh're all righ'
[4000]9140   Yeh look all hot an'bothered-Harry couldn't bring himself to repeat what Ernie and the rest of the Hufflepuffs had been saying about him
[4001]9836   It's nothing, he said
[4002]7596    Id better get going, Hagrid, it's Transfiguration next and I've got to pick up my books
[4003]5461   He walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him
[4004]7521   Justin's been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-bornHarry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor, which was particularly dark; the torches had been extinguished by a strong, icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane
[4005]429    He was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over something lying on the floor
[4006]1327   He turned to squint at what he'd fallen over and felt as though his stomach had dissolved
[4007]2315   Justin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of shock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling
[4008]2449    And that wasn't all
[4009]6047    Next to him was another figure, the strangest sight Harry had ever seen
[4010]981   It was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and transparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor
[4011]6105    His head was half off and his face wore an expression of shock identical to Justin's
[4012]7162   Harry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs
[4013]1017    He lookedwildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies
[4014]180    The only sounds were the muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side
[4015]841   He could run, and no one would ever know he had been there
[4016]6104    But he couldn't just leave them lying here He had to get help Would anyone believe he hadn't had anything to do with this
[4017]1409  As he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him opened with a bang
[4018]303    Peeves the Poltergeist came shooting out
[4019]5220   Why, it's potty wee Potter
[4020]10792   cackled Peeves, knocking Harry's glasses askew as he bounced past him
[4021]5211    What's Potter up to
[4022]5477   Why's Potter lurking-Peeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault
[4023]354    Upside down, he spotted Justin and Nearly Headless Nick
[4024]6925    He flipped the right way up, filled his lungs and, before Harry could stop him, screamed, ATTACK
[4025]65   ATTACK
[4026]65   ANOTHER ATTACK
[4027]56   NO MORTAL OR GHOST IS SAFE
[4028]86   RUN FOR YOUR LIVES
[4029]1   ATTAAAACK
[4030]1814  Crash - crash - crash - door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out
[4031]1405    For several long minutes, there was a scene of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick
[4032]6112    Harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet
[4033]2042    Professor McGonagall came running, followed by her own class, one of whom still had black-and-white-striped hair
[4034]849    She used her wand to set off a loud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into their classes
[4035]290    No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene
[4036]123   Caught in the act
[4037]6613   Ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing his finger dramatically at Harry
[4038]16   That will do, Macmillan
[4039]6147   said Professor McGonagall sharply
[4040]225   Peeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the scene; Peeves always loved chaos
[4041]12360    As the teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song:Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done, You're killing off'students, you think it's good fun-That's enough Peeves
[4042]7211   barked Professor McGonagall, and Peeves zoomed away backward, with his tongue out at Harry
[4043]2830   Justin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed to know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick
[4044]2258    In the end, Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave to Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs
[4045]1847    This Ernie did, fanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft
[4046]7013    This left Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together
[4047]5902   This way, Potter, she said
[4048]21035   Professor, said Harry at once, I swear I didn't-This is out of my hands, Potter, said Professor McGonagall curtly
[4049]730   They marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle
[4050]22   Lemon drop
[4051]5086   she said
[4052]439    This was evidently a password, because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two
[4053]8310    Even full of dread for what was coming, Harry couldn't fail to be amazed
[4054]1057    Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator
[4055]7325    As he and Professor McGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed behind them
[4056]6952    They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin
[4057]357   He knew now where he was being taken
[4058]833    This must be where Dumbledore lived

[4074]1737     They stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and Professor McGonagall rapped on the door
[4075]260    It opened silently and they entered
[4076]7412    Professor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there, alone
[4077]6408   Harry looked around
[4078]12061    One thing was certain: of all the teachers'offices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore's was by far the most interesting
[4079]3268    If he hadn't been scared out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it
[4080]1059   It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises
[4081]733    A number of curious silver instruments stood on spindle legged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke
[4082]405    The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames
[4083]5488    There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard's hat - the Sorting Hat
[4084]5758   Harry hesitated
[4085]406    He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls
[4086]2971    Surely it couldn't hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again
[4087]2816   Just to see just to make sure it had put him in the right House
[4088]1219   He walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and lowered it slowly onto his head
[4089]2718    It was much too large and slipped down over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he'd put it on
[4090]6477    Harry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting
[4091]12029    Then a small voice said in his ear, Bee in your bonnet, Harry Potter
[4092]6252  Er, yes, Harry muttered
[4093]7206    Er - sorry to bother you - I wanted to ask-You've been wondering whether I put you in the right House, said the hat smartly
[4094]561    Yes you were particularly difficult to place
[4095]26476    But I stand by what I said before - Harry's heart leapt - you would have done well in Slytherin-Harry's stomach plummeted
[4096]392    He grabbed the point of the hat and pulled it off
[4097]413    It hung limply in his hand, grubby and faded
[4098]5996    Harry pushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick
[4099]5342   You're wrong, he said aloud to the still and silent hat
[4100]2708    It didn't move
[4101]6245    Harry backed away, watching it
[4102]109    Then a strange, gagging noise behind him made him wheel around
[4103]2449   He wasn't alone after all
[4104]1535    Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey
[4105]6741    Harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making its gagging noise again
[4106]6814    Harry thought it looked very ill
[4107]6577    Its eyes were dull and, even as Harry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail
[4108]12587   Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore's pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the bird burst into flames
[4109]6352   Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk
[4110]4157    He looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldn't see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smouldering pile of ash on the floor
[4111]838   The office door opened
[4112]1646    Dumbledore came in, looking very somber
[4113]6523   Professor, Harry gasped
[4114]14712    Your bird - I couldn't do anything - he just caught fire-To Harry's astonishment, Dumbledore smiled
[4115]5642   About time, too, he said
[4116]6238    He's been looking dreadful for days; I've been telling him to get a move on
[4117]11486   He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry's face
[4118]5848   Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry
[4119]672    Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes
[4120]1920    Watch himHarry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes
[4121]415    It was quite as ugly as the old one
[4122]10989   It's a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day, said Dumbledore, seating himself behind his desk
[4123]5785    He's really very handsome most of the time, wonderful red and gold plumage
[4124]60    Fascinating creatures, phoenixes
[4125]419    They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets
[4126]13267   In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what he was there for, but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settled himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his penetrating, light-blue stare
[4127]4878   Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand
[4128]7441   It wasn'Harry, Professor Dumbledore
[4129]5761   said Hagrid urgently
[4130]3067    I was talkin'ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir-Dumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on, waving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers everywhere
[4131]4276   it can't've bin him, I'll swear it in front o'the Ministry o'Magic if I have to
[4132]9673   Hagrid, I-- yeh've got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never-Hagrid
[4133]6039   said Dumbledore loudly
[4134]6664    I do not think that Harry attacked those people
[4135]6144   Oh, said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side
[4136]557    Right
[4137]827    I'll wait outside then, Headmaster
[4138]616   And he stomped out looking embarrassed
[4139]4254   You don't think it was me, Professor
[4140]6790   Harry repeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk
[4141]15099   No, Harry, I don't, said Dumbledore, though his face was somber again
[4142]455    But I still want to talk to you
[4143]7071   Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of his long fingers together
[4144]12641   I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you'd like to tell me, he said gently
[4145]0    Anything at all
[4146]9481   Harry didn't know what to say
[4147]1438    He thought of Malfoy shouting, You'll be next, Mudbloods
[4148]5284   and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom
[4149]11572    Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said: Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world
[4150]11382    He thought, too, about what everyone was saying about him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with Salazar SlytherinNo, said Harry
[4151]3227    There isn't anything, ProfessorThe double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic
[4152]5388    Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick's fate that seemed to worry people most
[4153]42    What could possibly do that to a ghost
[4154]851   people asked each other; what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead
[4155]647   There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas
[4156]10546   At this rate, we'll be the only ones left, Ron told Harry and Hermione
[4157]596    Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle
[4158]5254    What a jolly holiday it's going to be
[4159]2066   Crabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed up to stay over the holidays, too
[4160]6138    But Harry was glad that most people were leaving
[4161]742    He was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors, as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed
[4162]859   Fred and George, however, found all this very funny
[4163]7501    They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting, Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming throughPercy was deeply disapproving of this behavior
[4164]5260   It is not a laughing matter, he said coldly
[4165]6355   Oh, get out of the way, Percy, said Fred
[4166]10518    Harry's in a hurry
[4167]10735   Yeah, he's off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant, said George, chortling
[4168]3054   Ginny didn't find it amusing either
[4169]17038   Oh, don't, she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he was planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met
[4170]15326   Harry didn't mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at least, thought the idea of his being Slytherin's heir was quite ludicrous
[4171]2067    But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it
[4172]21904   It's because he's bursting to say it's really him, said Ron knowingly
[4173]1041    You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you're getting all the credit for his dirty work
[4174]7102   Not for long, said Hermione in a satisfied tone
[4175]5026    The Polyjuice Potion's nearly ready
[4176]882    We'll be getting the truth out of him any day now
[4177]432   At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle
[4178]8109    Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private
[4179]1849    Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr
[4180]369    and Mrs
[4181]636    Weasley
[4182]4147    Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior, didn't spend much time in the Gryffindor common room
[4183]1121    He had already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time
[4184]360   Christmas morning dawned, cold and white
[4185]9930    Harry and Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both
[4186]5516   Wake up, she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window
[4187]9416   Hermione - you're not supposed to be in here - said Ron, shielding his eyes against the light
[4188]6847   Merry Christmas to you, too, said Hermione, throwing him his present
[4189]964    I've been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to the potion
[4190]4830    It's ready
[4191]6065   Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake
[4192]227   Are you sure
[4193]13759  Positive, said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron's four-poster
[4194]803    If we're going to do it, I say it should be tonight
[4195]1050   At that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a very small package in her beak
[4196]11107   Hello, said Harry happily as she landed on his bed
[4197]42    Are you speaking to me again
[4198]1290  She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him, which turned out to be from the Dursleys
[4199]7086    They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether he'd be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too
[4200]10807   The rest of Harry's Christmas presents were far more satisfactory
[4201]11369    Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxurious eagle-feather quill
[4202]6812    Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from Mrs
[4203]859    Weasley and a large plum cake
[4204]644    He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr
[4205]10195    Weasley's car (which hadn't been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next
[4206]718   No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts
[4207]1139   The Great Hall looked magnificent
[4208]503    Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling
[4209]1687    Dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed
[4210]3419    Percy, who hadn't noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read Pinhead, kept asking them all what they were sniggering at
[4211]9723    Harry didn't even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remark about his new sweater from the Slytherin table
[4212]1376    With a bit of luck, Malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours'time
[4213]9869   Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening
[4214]7523   We still need a bit of the people you're changing into, said Hermione matter-of-factly, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent
[4215]11415    And obviously, it'll be best if you can get something of Crabbe's and Goyle's; they're Malfoys best friends, he'll tell them anything
[4216]3210    And we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating him
[4217]18929   I've got it all worked out, she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry's and Ron's stupefied faces
[4218]97    She held up two plump chocolate cakes
[4219]773    I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught
[4220]587    All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them
[4221]828    You know how greedy they are, they're bound to eat them
[4222]142    Once they're asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet
[4223]8424   Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other
[4224]8021   Hermione, I don't think-That could go seriously wrong-But Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one Professor McGonagall sometimes had
[4225]14996   The potion will be useless without Crabbe's and Goyle's hair, she said sternly
[4226]3721    You do want to investigate Malfoy, don't you
[4227]12294  Oh, all right, all right, said Harry
[4228]0    But what about you
[4229]171   Whose hair are you ripping out
[4230]1383  I've already got mine
[4231]7396   said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it
[4232]161    Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club
[4233]664   She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me
[4234]7942   And she's gone home for Christmas - so I'll just have to tell the Slytherins I've decided to come back
[4235]9873   When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again, Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression
[4236]510   Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong
[4237]24993  But to Harry's and Ron's utter amazement, stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said
[4238]1073    They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle
[4239]5994    Harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters
[4240]9157    When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door
[4241]0   How thick can you get
[4242]2415   Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them
[4243]299    Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths
[4244]406    For a moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their faces
[4245]394    Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over backward onto the floor
[4246]382   By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall
[4247]17753    Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle's forehead and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe's hairs
[4248]741    They also stole their shoes, because their own were far too small for Crabbe- and Goyle-size feet
[4249]5710    Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom
[4250]1999   They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron
[4251]8589    Pulling their robes up over their faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door
[4252]1615   Hermione
[4253]2630  They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shiny-faced and looking anxious
[4254]344    Behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling, glutinous potion
[4255]422    Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat
[4256]667   Did you get them
[4257]1988   Hermione asked breathlessly
[4258]10751   Harry showed her Goyle's hair
[4259]343   Good
[4260]7123    And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry, Hermione said, holding up a small sack
[4261]917    You'll need bigger sizes once you're Crabbe and Goyle
[4262]164   The three of them stared into the cauldron
[4263]1900    Close up, the potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly
[4264]8778   I'm sure I've done everything right, said Hermione, nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions
[4265]2451    It looks like the book says it should once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves
[4266]0   Now what
[4267]2125   Ron whispered
[4268]97   We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs
[4269]1962   Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses
[4270]5536    Then, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode's hair out of its bottle into the first glass
[4271]996   The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly
[4272]738    A second later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow
[4273]7149   Urgh - essence of Millicent Bulstrode, said Ron, eyeing it with loathing
[4274]53    Bet it tastes disgusting
[4275]6717   Add yours, then, said Hermione
[4276]17790   Harry dropped Goyle's hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe's into the last one
[4277]10428    Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle's turned the khaki color of a booger, Crabbe's a dark, murky brown
[4278]14651   Hang on, said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses
[4279]3531    We'd better not all drink them in here Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we won't fit
[4280]4781    And Millicent Bulstrode's no pixie
[4281]8020   Good thinking, said Ron, unlocking the door
[4282]576    We'll take separate stalls
[4283]5976   Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the middle stall
[4284]80   Ready
[4285]119   he called
[4286]13464   Ready, came Ron's and Hermione's voices
[4287]6137   One - two - three-Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps
[4288]740    It tasted like overcooked cabbage
[4289]7537   Immediately, his insides started writhing as though he'd just swallowed live snakes - doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be sick - then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers and toes - next, bringing him gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax - and before his eyes, his hands began to grow, the fingers thickened, the nails broadened, the knuckles were bulging like bolts - his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows - his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops - his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small
[4290]340   As suddenly as it had started, everything stopped
[4291]6670    Harry lay facedown on the stone-cold floor, listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet
[4292]215    With difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up
[4293]1095    So this was what it felt like, being Goyle
[4294]6315    His large hand trembling, he pulled off his old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on the spare ones, and laced up Goyle's boatlike shoes
[4295]1049    He reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead
[4296]3933    Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn't need them - he took them off and called, Are you two okay
[4297]5646   Goyle's low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth
[4298]1214   Yeah, came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right
[4299]6340   Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror
[4300]713    Goyle stared back at him out of dull, deepset eyes
[4301]5806    Harry scratched his ear
[4302]748    So did Goyle
[4303]7420   Ron's door opened
[4304]122    They stared at each other
[4305]3299    Except that he looked pale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the pudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms
[4306]12112   This is unbelievable, said Ron, approaching the mirror and prodding Crabbe's flat nose
[4307]6    Unbelievable
[4308]17044   We'd better get going, said Harry, loosening the watch that was cutting into Goyle's thick wrist
[4309]2079    We've still got to find out where the Slytherin common room is
[4310]14825    I only hope we can find someone to followRon, who had been gazing at Harry, said, You don't know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking
[4311]6869    He banged on Hermione's door
[4312]931    C'mon, we need to go-A high-pitched voice answered him
[4313]4869   I - I don't think I'm going to come after all
[4314]0    You go on without me
[4315]22756   Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode's ugly, no one's going to know it's you-No - really - I don't think I'll come
[4316]9020    You two hurry up, you're wasting time-Harry looked at Ron, bewildered
[4317]7991   That looks more like Goyle, said Ron
[4318]5523    That's how he looks every time a teacher asks him a question
[4319]1637   Hermione, are you okay
[4320]11316   said Harry through the door
[4321]7080   Fine - I'm fine - go on-Harry looked at his watch
[4322]231    Five of their precious sixty minutes had already passed
[4323]1176   We'll meet you back here, all right
[4324]5086   he said
[4325]8708   Harry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set off
[4326]11600   Don't swing your arms like that, Harry muttered to Ron
[4327]28   Eh
[4328]4899  Crabbe holds them sort of stiffHow's this
[4329]5307  Yeah, that's betterThey went down the marble staircase
[4330]917    All they needed now was a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but there was nobody around
[4331]7   Any ideas
[4332]5839   muttered Harry
[4333]7723   The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there, said Ron, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons
[4334]1335    The words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the entrance
[4335]7140   Excuse me, said Ron, hurrying up to her
[4336]1634    We've forgotten the way to our common room
[4337]16   I beg your pardon
[4338]5158   said the girl stiffly
[4339]545    Our common room
[4340]474   I'm a Ravenclaw
[4341]1116   She walked away, looking suspiciously back at them
[4342]21734   Harry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe's and Goyle's huge feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn't going to be as easy as they had hoped
[4343]33   The labyrinthine passages were deserted
[4344]1264    They walked deeper and deeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to see how much time they had left
[4345]1402    After a quarter of an hour, just when they were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead
[4346]29   Ha
[4347]7115   said Ron excitedly
[4348]4750    There's one of them now
[4349]488  The figure was emerging from a side room
[4350]160    As they hurried nearer, however, their hearts sank
[4351]2724    It wasn't a Slytherin, it was Percy
[4352]182   What're you doing down here
[4353]7129   said Ron in surprise
[4354]805   Percy looked affronted
[4355]5134   That, he said stiffly, is none of your business
[4356]7234    It's Crabbe, isn't it
[4357]7729  Wh - oh, yeah, said Ron
[4358]5240   Well, get off to your dormitories, said Percy sternly
[4359]5223    It's not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days
[4360]2085   You are, Ron pointed out
[4361]5305   I, said Percy, drawing himself up, am a prefect
[4362]4815    Nothing's about to attack me
[4363]8402   A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron
[4364]6932    Draco Malfoy was strolling toward them, and for the first time in his life, Harry was pleased to see him
[4365]611   There you are, he drawled, looking at them
[4366]1015    Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time
[4367]1974   I've been looking for you; I want to show you something really funny
[4368]625   Malfoy glanced witheringly at Percy
[4369]818   And what're you doing down here, Weasley
[4370]13   he sneered
[4371]809   Percy looked outraged
[4372]827   You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect
[4373]5086   he said
[4374]3683    I don't like your attitude
[4375]8222  Malfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him
[4376]12406    Harry almost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in time
[4377]10736    He and Ron hurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into the next passage, That Peter Weasley-Percy, Ron corrected him automatically
[4378]5526   Whatever, said Malfoy
[4379]876    I've noticed him sneaking around a lot lately
[4380]5562    And I bet I know what he's up to
[4381]10341    He thinks he's going to catch Slytherin's heir single-handed
[4382]349   He gave a short, derisive laugh
[4383]7860    Harry and Ron exchanged excited looks
[4384]757   Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall
[4385]4900   What's the new password again
[4386]10818   he said to Harry
[4387]10939   Er - said Harry
[4388]756   Oh, yeah - pure-blood
[4389]6647   said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open
[4390]8320    Malfoy marched through it, and Harry and Ron followed him
[4391]2049   The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains
[4392]299    A fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several Slytherins were silhouetted around it in high-backed chairs
[4393]13558   Wait here, said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire
[4394]15940    I'll go and get it my father's just sent it to me-Wondering what Malfoy was going to show them, Harry and Ron sat down, doing their best to look at home
[4395]2348   Malfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked like a newspaper clipping
[4396]6881    He thrust it under Ron's nose
[4397]5706   That'll give you a laugh, he said
[4398]13326   Harry saw Ron's eyes widen in shock
[4399]6373    He read the clipping quickly, gave a very forced laugh, and handed it to Harry
[4400]7175   It had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet , and it said:INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGICArthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car
[4401]372   Mr
[4402]1863    Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the enchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for Mr
[4403]5388    Weasley's resignation
[4404]1269    Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute, Mr
[4405]764    Malfoy told our reporter
[4406]287    He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately
[4407]372   Mr
[4408]1896    Weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife told reporters to clear off or she'd set the family ghoul on them
[4409]0   Well
[4410]11343   said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the clipping back to him
[4411]8306    Don't you think it's funny
[4412]10878  Ha, ha, said Harry bleakly
[4413]6925   Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them, said Malfoy scornfully
[4414]1817    You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave
[4415]12124   Ron's - or rather, Crabbe's - face was contorted with fury
[4416]4825   What's up with you, Crabbe
[4417]491   snapped Malfoy
[4418]2024   Stomachache, Ron grunted
[4419]5653   Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick from me, said Malfoy, snickering
[4420]3971    You know, I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't reported all these attacks yet, he went on thoughtfully
[4421]5866    I suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush it all up
[4422]3204    He'll be sacked if it doesn't stop soon
[4423]20984    Father's always said old Dumbledore's the worst thing that's ever happened to this place
[4424]113    He loves Muggle-borns
[4425]1848    A decent headmaster would never've let slime like that Creevey in
[4426]2434   Malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel but accurate impression of Colin: `Potter, can I have your picture, Potter
[4427]4   Can I have your autograph
[4428]481   Can I lick your shoes, please, Potter
[4429]8659  He dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron
[4430]4836   What's the matter with you two
[4431]8646  Far too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh, but Malfoy seemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on the uptake
[4432]6188   Saint Potter, the Mudbloods'friend, said Malfoy slowly
[4433]7600    He's another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go around with that jumped up Granger Mudblood
[4434]10553    And people think he's Slytherin's heir
[4435]14690  Harry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely seconds away from telling them it was him - but then I wish I knew who it is, said Malfoy petulantly
[4436]145    I could help them
[4437]7680   Ron's jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than usual
[4438]22725    Fortunately, Malfoy didn't notice, and Harry, thinking fast, said, You must have some idea who's behind it allYou know I haven't, Goyle, how many times do I have to tell you
[4439]491   snapped Malfoy
[4440]3696    And Father won't tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either
[4441]3175    Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it'll look suspicious if I know too much about it
[4442]1914    But I know one thing - last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died
[4443]20723    So I bet it's a matter of time before one of them's killed this time I hope it's Granger, he said with relish
[4444]6867   Ron was clenching Crabbe's gigantic fists
[4445]16553    Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning look and said, D'you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught
[4446]6208  Oh, yeah whoever it was was expelled, said Malfoy
[4447]119    They're probably still in Azkaban
[4448]52   Azkaban
[4449]10832   said Harry, puzzled
[4450]7566   Azkaban - the wizard prison, Goyle, said Malfoy, looking at him in disbelief Honestly, if you were any slower, you'd be going backward
[4451]6386   He shifted restlessly in his chair and said, Father says to keep my head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it
[4452]352    He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed up in it
[4453]6044    Of course, he's got a lot on his plate at the moment
[4454]1264    You know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week
[4455]11743  Harry tried to force Goyle's dull face into a look of concern
[4456]5803   Yeah said Malfoy
[4457]2713    Luckily, they didn't find much
[4458]5985    Father's got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff
[4459]2274    But luckily, we've got our own secret chamber under the drawing-room floor-Ho
[4460]7088   said Ron
[4461]1116   Malfoy looked at him
[4462]6399    So did Harry
[4463]2004    Ron blushed
[4464]345    Even his hair was turning red
[4465]8797    His nose was also slowly lengthening - their hour was up, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror he was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too
[4466]289   They both jumped to their feet
[4467]6123   Medicine for my stomach, Ron grunted, and without further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurled themselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that Malfoy hadn't noticed anything
[4468]12761    Harry could feel his feet slipping around in Goyle's huge shoes and had to hoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where they'd locked Crabbe and Goyle
[4469]5693    Leaving their shoes outside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up the marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom
[4470]5609   Well, it wasn't a complete waste of time, Ron panted, closing the bathroom door behind them
[4471]10127    I know we still haven't found out who's doing the attacks, but I'm going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the Malfoys'drawing room
[4472]6312   Harry checked his face in the cracked mirror
[4473]32    He was back to normal
[4474]8945    He put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Hermione's stall
[4475]4139   Hermione, come out, we've got loads to tell you-Go away
[4476]1624   Hermione squeaked
[4477]8410   Harry and Ron looked at each other
[4478]4836   What's the matter
[4479]7088   said Ron
[4480]32    You must be back to normal by now, we are
[4481]695   But Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door
[4482]6574    Harry had never seen her looking so happy
[4483]5184   Ooooooh, wait till you see, she said
[4484]7543    It's awful-They heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged, sobbing, her robes pulled up over her head
[4485]4750   What's up
[4486]7105   said Ron uncertainly
[4487]5571    Have you still got Millicent's nose or something
[4488]4157  Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink
[4489]829   Her face was covered in black fur
[4490]1533    Her eyes had turned yellow and there were long, pointed ears poking through her hair
[4491]240   It was a c-cat hair
[4492]9   she howled
[4493]947    M-Millicent Bulstrode m-must have a cat
[4494]2664   And the p-potion isn't supposed to be used for animal transformations
[4495]7455  Uh-oh, said Ron
[4496]5772   You'll be teased something dreadful, said Myrtle happily
[4497]17360   It's okay, Hermione, said Harry quickly
[4498]676    We'll take you up to the hospital wing
[4499]3048    Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questionsIt took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom
[4500]471    Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw
[4501]1516    Wait till everyone finds out you've got a tail

[4512]1799     Hermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks
[4513]1171    There was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked
[4514]8399    So many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around Hermione's bed, to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry face
[4515]8039   Harry and Ron went to visit her every evening
[4516]5318    When the new term started, they brought her each day's homework
[4517]15245   If I'd sprouted whiskers, I'd take a break from work, said Ron, tipping a stack of books onto Hermione's bedside table one evening
[4518]13066   Don't be silly, Ron, I've got to keep up, said Hermione briskly
[4519]1639    Her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown
[4520]4531    I don't suppose you've got any new leads
[4521]2892   she added in a whisper, so that Madam Pomfrey couldn't hear her
[4522]10829   Nothing, said Harry gloomily
[4523]8314   I was so sure it was Malfoy, said Ron, for about the hundredth time
[4524]4750   What's that
[4525]12634   asked Harry, pointing to something gold sticking out from under Hermione's pillow
[4526]9943   Just a get well card, said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for her
[4527]7992    He pulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud:To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most Charming Smile Award
[4528]4300   Ron looked up at Hermione, disgusted
[4529]43   You sleep with this under your pillow
[4530]1880  But Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of medicine
[4531]974   Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you've ever met, or what
[4532]13527   Ron said to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower
[4533]7028   Snape had given them so much homework, Harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he finished it
[4534]5853    Ron was just saying he wished he had asked Hermione how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a Hair Raising Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears
[4535]11209   That's Filch, Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused, out of sight, listening hard
[4536]8311   You don't think someone else's been attacked
[4537]7092   said Ron tensely
[4538]5767   They stood still, their heads inclined toward Flich's voice, which sounded quite hysterical
[4539]103   even more work for me
[4540]4059   Mopping all night, like I haven't got enough to do
[4541]2849   No, this is the final straw, I'm going to Dumbledore-His footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard a distant door slam
[4542]170   They poked their heads around the corner
[4543]699    Filch had clearly been manning his usual lookout post: They were once again on the spot where Mrs
[4544]87    Norris had been attacked
[4545]493    They saw at a glance what Filch had been shouting about
[4546]6669    A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom
[4547]5381    Now that Filch had stopped shouting, they could hear Myrtle's wails echoing off the bathroom walls
[4548]4750   Now what's up with her
[4549]7088   said Ron
[4550]17346   Let's go and see, said Harry, and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its OUT OF ORDER sign, ignored it as always, and entered
[4551]194   Moaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and harder than ever before
[4552]154    She seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet
[4553]1327    It was dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet
[4554]4807   What's up, Myrtle
[4555]10818   said Harry
[4556]4750   Who's that
[4557]83   glugged Myrtle miserably
[4558]457    Come to throw something else at me
[4559]10851  Harry waded across to her stall and said, Why would I throw something at you
[4560]3596  Don't ask me, Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave of yet more water, which splashed onto the already sopping floor
[4561]18184    Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at meBut it can't hurt you if someone throws something at you, said Harry, reasonably
[4562]4638    I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it
[4563]5349  He had said the wrong thing
[4564]7753    Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked, Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it
[4565]111   Ten points if you can get it through her stomach
[4566]590   Fifty points if it goes through her head
[4567]87   Well, ha, ha, ha
[4568]3533   What a lovely game, I don't think
[4569]67  Who threw it at you, anyway
[4570]6088   asked Harry
[4571]11268   I don't know I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell right through the top of my head, said Myrtle, glaring at them
[4572]8300    It's over there, it got washed outHarry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing
[4573]301    A small, thin book lay there
[4574]328    It had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom
[4575]8168    Harry stepped forward to pick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back
[4576]0   What
[4577]10818   said Harry
[4578]5   Are you crazy
[4579]7088   said Ron
[4580]47    It could be dangerous
[4581]47   Dangerous
[4582]10874  "said Harry, laughing
[4583]483    Come off it, how could it be dangerous
[4584]8438  You'd be surprised, said Ron, who was looking apprehensively at the book
[4585]10736    Some of the books the Ministry's confiscated Dad's told me - there was one that burned your eyes out
[4586]323    And everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives
[4587]536    And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading
[4588]1198   You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed
[4589]12843    And-All right, I've got the point, said Harry
[4590]717   The little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy
[4591]10345   Well, we won't find out unless we look at it, he said, and he ducked around Ron and picked it up off the floor
[4592]7081   Harry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old
[4593]221    He opened it eagerly
[4594]3807    On the first page he could just make out the name T M
[4595]180    Riddle in smudged ink
[4596]18343   Hang on, said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was looking over Harry's shoulder
[4597]3079    I know that name T
[4598]441    M
[4599]1376    Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago
[4600]1430   How on earth d'you know that
[4601]10827   said Harry in amazement
[4602]7369   Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention, said Ron resentfully
[4603]13    That was the one I burped slugs all over
[4604]1441    If you'd wiped slime off a name for an hour, you'd remember it, too
[4605]5801   Harry peeled the wet pages apart
[4606]93    They were completely blank
[4607]7609    There wasn't the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel's birthday, or dentist, half-past three
[4608]10857   He never wrote in it, said Harry, disappointed
[4609]555   I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away
[4610]7104   said Ron curiously
[4611]6561   Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London
[4612]11653   He must've been Muggle-born, said Harry thoughtfully
[4613]12034    To have bought a diary from Vauxhall RoadWell, it's not much use to you, said Ron
[4614]613    He dropped his voice
[4615]5011    Fifty points if you can get it through Myrtle's nose
[4616]5736   Harry, however, pocketed it
[4617]2044   Hermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less, and furfree, at the beginning of February
[4618]8380    On her first evening back in Gryffindor Tower, Harry showed her T
[4619]441    M
[4620]5346    Riddle's diary and told her the story of how they had found it
[4621]7642   Oooh, it might have hidden powers, said Hermione enthusiastically, taking the diary and looking at it closely
[4622]11872   If it has, it's hiding them very well, said Ron
[4623]4826    Maybe it's shy
[4624]12393    I don't know why you don't chuck it, Harry
[4625]11906   I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it, said Harry
[4626]3705    I wouldn't mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services to Hogwarts either
[4627]7781   Could've been anything, said Ron
[4628]895    Maybe he got thirty O
[4629]18   W
[4630]5   L
[4631]4902   s or saved a teacher from the giant squid
[4632]14425    Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would've done everyone a favor But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione's face that she was thinking what he was thinking
[4633]0   What
[4634]7693   said Ron, looking from one to the other
[4635]3068   Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn't it
[4636]5086   he said
[4637]10276    That's what Malfoy said
[4638]7491   Yeah said Ron slowly
[4639]7207   And this diary is fifty years old, said Hermione, tapping it excitedly
[4640]0   So
[4641]4062  Oh, Ron, wake up, snapped Hermione
[4642]2004    We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago
[4643]3079    We know T
[4644]441    M
[4645]1376    Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago
[4646]1054    Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin
[4647]9177   His diary would probably tell us everything - where the Chamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it - the person who's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want that lying around, would they
[4648]14671  That's a brilliant theory, Hermione, said Ron, with just one tiny little flaw
[4649]4865    There's nothing written in his diary
[4650]2174   But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag
[4651]68   It might be invisible ink
[4652]123   she whispered
[4653]5246   She tapped the diary three times and said, Aparecium
[4654]143  Nothing happened
[4655]2463    Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser
[4656]10570   It's a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley, she said
[4657]183   She rubbed hard on January first
[4658]143    Nothing happened
[4659]12372   I'm telling you, there's nothing to find in there, said Ron
[4660]4233    Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and couldn't be bothered filling it in
[4661]17049   Harry couldn't explain, even to himself, why he didn't just throw Riddle's diary away
[4662]966    The fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, as though it were a story he wanted to finish
[4663]8538    And while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T
[4664]441    M
[4665]1547    Riddle before, it still seemed to mean something to him, almost as though Riddle was a friend he'd had when he was very small, and had half-forgotten
[4666]3    But this was absurd
[4667]1304    He'd never had friends before Hogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that
[4668]16778   Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so next day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle's special award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he'd seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime
[4669]5423   Riddle's burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet
[4670]11690    It didn't carry details of why it had been given to him ("Good thing, too, or it'd be even bigger and I'd still be polishing it, said Ron)
[4671]6586    However, they did find Riddle's name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys
[4672]8104   He sounds like Percy, said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust
[4673]14392    Prefect, Head Boy probably top of every class-You say that like it's a bad thing, said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice
[4674]299   The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again
[4675]371    Inside the castle, the mood had grown more hopeful
[4676]819    There had been no more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving childhood
[4677]7180   The moment their acne clears up, they'll be ready for repotting again, Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon
[4678]2806    And after that, it won't be long until we're cutting them up and stewing them
[4679]936    You'll have Mrs
[4680]585    Norris back in no time
[4681]6365   Perhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry
[4682]772    It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with the school so alert and suspicious
[4683]2883    Perhaps the monster, whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty yearsErnie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn't take this cheerful view
[4684]6224    He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had given himself away at the Dueling Club
[4685]3635    Peeves wasn't helping matters; he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing Oh, Potter, you rotter now with a dance routine to match
[4686]961   Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop
[4687]6911    Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration
[4688]9380    I don't think there'll be any more trouble, Minerva, he said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking
[4689]1586    I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time
[4690]790    The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him
[4691]532    Rather sensible to stop now, before I came down hard on him
[4692]1020   You know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster
[4693]409    Wash away the memories of last term
[4694]5840   I won't say any more just now, but I think I know just the thingHe tapped his nose again and strode off
[4695]5747   Lockhart's idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on February fourteenth
[4696]9402    Harry hadn't had much sleep because of a late-running Quidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to the Great Hall, slightly late
[4697]1606    He thought, for a moment, that he'd walked through the wrong doors
[4698]403   The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers
[4699]390    Worse still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling
[4700]10687    Harry went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles
[4701]5239   What's going on
[4702]6247   Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon
[4703]2489   Ron pointed to the teachers'table, apparently too disgusted to speak
[4704]641    Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was waving for silence
[4705]699    The teachers on either side of him were looking stony-faced
[4706]12123    From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall's cheek
[4707]2195    Snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro
[4708]4974   Happy Valentine's Day
[4709]339   Lockhart shouted
[4710]582    And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards
[4711]3339   Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn't end here
[4712]1432  Lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs
[4713]812    Not just any dwarfs, however
[4714]428    Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps
[4715]80   My friendly, card-carrying cupids
[4716]223   beamed Lockhart
[4717]294    They will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines
[4718]2571   And the fun doesn't stop here
[4719]1035   I'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion
[4720]1432   Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion
[4721]1974   And while you're at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I've ever met, the sly old dog
[4722]1492  Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands
[4723]1412    Snape was looking as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison
[4724]12188   Please, Hermione, tell me you weren't one of the forty-six, said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson
[4725]4613    Hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn't answer
[4726]6809   All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up with Harry
[4727]2   Oy, you
[4728]467   Arry Potter
[4729]7192   shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry
[4730]7739   Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape
[4731]6448    The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by kicking people's shins, and reached him before he'd gone two paces
[4732]7496   I've got a musical message to deliver to Arry Potter in person, he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way
[4733]6018   Not here, Harry hissed, trying to escape
[4734]71   Stay still
[4735]10719   grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry's bag and pulling him back
[4736]320   Let me go
[4737]5780   Harry snarled, tugging
[4738]268   With a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two
[4739]1057    His books, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything
[4740]6300   Harry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor
[4741]5239   What's going on here
[4742]1369   came the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy
[4743]6975    Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine
[4744]4756   What's all this commotion
[4745]6470   said another familiar voice as Percy Weasley arrived
[4746]7078   Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor
[4747]16263   Right, he said, sitting on Harry's ankles
[4748]6733    Here is your singing valentine:His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,His hair is as dark as a blackboard,I wish he was mine,he's really divine,The hero who conquered the Dark LordHarry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot
[4749]2900    Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth
[4750]6013   Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now, he said, shooing some of the younger students away
[4751]6970    And you, Malfoy-Harry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something
[4752]12205    Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that he'd got Riddle's diary
[4753]10955   Give that back, said Harry quietly
[4754]5280   Wonder what Potter's written in this
[4755]19214   said Malfoy, who obviously hadn't noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry's own diary
[4756]153    A hush fell over the onlookers
[4757]6957    Ginny was staring from the diary to Harry, looking terrified
[4758]6017   Hand it over, Malfoy, said Percy sternly
[4759]12514   When I've had a look, said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at Harry
[4760]11325   Percy said, As a school prefect - but Harry had lost his temper
[4761]725    He pulled out his wand and shouted, Expelliarmus
[4762]2543   and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air
[4763]2153    Ron, grinning broadly, caught it
[4764]5732   Harry
[4765]5346   said Percy loudly
[4766]259    No magic in the corridors
[4767]1360    I'll have to report this, you know
[4768]9386  But Harry didn't care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day
[4769]5664    Malfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her, I don't think Potter liked your valentine much
[4770]1302  Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class
[4771]8833    Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away
[4772]4960    Ron didn't need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs
[4773]19084   It wasn't until they had reached Professor Flitwick's class that Harry noticed something rather odd about Riddle's diary
[4774]162    All his other books were drenched in scarlet ink
[4775]208    The diary, however, was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it
[4776]7752    He tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn't much interested in anything else
[4777]6348   Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night
[4778]13727    This was partly because he didn't think he could stand Fred and George singing, His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle's diary again, and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time
[4779]6033   Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it
[4780]652    Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary
[4781]405   The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it was being sucked into the page, vanished
[4782]12747    Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote, My name is Harry Potter
[4783]229   The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace
[4784]143    Then, at last, something happened
[4785]6196   Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry had never written
[4786]6229   Hello, Harry Potter
[4787]158    My name is Tom Riddle
[4788]1179    How did you come by my diary
[4789]6320  These words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to scribble back
[4790]164   Someone tried to flush it down a toilet
[4791]4979   He waited eagerly for Riddle's reply
[4792]445   Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink
[4793]817    But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read
[4794]231   What do you mean
[4795]5810   Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his excitement
[4796]500   `I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things
[4797]198    Things that were covered up
[4798]765    Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
[4799]10660   That's where I am now, Harry wrote quickly
[4800]5589    I'm at Hogwarts, and horrible stuff's been happening
[4801]934    Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets
[4802]107  His heart was hammering
[4803]5962    Riddle's reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew
[4804]1151   Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets
[4805]1167    In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist
[4806]22    But this was a lie
[4807]778    In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one
[4808]1110    I caught the person who'd opened the Chamber and he was expelled
[4809]1769    But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth
[4810]278    A story was given out that the girl had died in a freak accident
[4811]684    They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut
[4812]325    But I knew it could happen again
[4813]91    The monster lived on, and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned
[4814]6019   Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back
[4815]4784   It's happening again now
[4816]5541    There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who's behind them
[4817]556    Who was it last time
[4818]5852  I can show you, if you like, came Riddle's reply
[4819]3020    You don't have to take my word for it
[4820]528    I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him
[4821]5914   Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary
[4822]1033    What did Riddle mean
[4823]5123   How could he be taken inside somebody else's memory
[4824]998   He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was growing dark
[4825]1227    When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming
[4826]320   Let me show you
[4827]5987   Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters
[4828]579   OKThe pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June
[4829]7191    Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen
[4830]2485    His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow
[4831]1362   He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus
[4832]324   He knew immediately where he was
[4833]9781    This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore's office - but it wasn't Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk
[4834]1167    A wizened, frail-looking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight
[4835]6036    Harry had never seen this man before
[4836]5630   I'm sorry, he said shakily
[4837]6253    I didn't mean to butt in-But the wizard didn't look up
[4838]421    He continued to read, frowning slightly
[4839]7439    Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, Er - I'll just go, shall I
[4840]170  Still the wizard ignored him
[4841]2979    He didn't seem even to have heard him
[4842]6634    Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice
[4843]104   Sorry I disturbed you
[4844]877    I'll go now, he half-shouted
[4845]6893   The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window
[4846]431   The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset
[4847]1262    The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door
[4848]6578   Harry looked around the office
[4849]215    No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirring silver contraptions
[4850]8165    This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago
[4851]683   There was a knock on the office door
[4852]5989   Enter, said the old wizard in a feeble voice
[4853]538   A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat
[4854]5003    A silver prefect's badge was glinting on his chest
[4855]6169    He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet-black hair
[4856]5327   Ah, Riddle, said the Headmaster
[4857]933   You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet
[4858]5221   said Riddle
[4859]707    He looked nervous
[4860]5138   Sit down, said Dippet
[4861]1722    I've just been reading the letter you sent me
[4862]5583   Oh, said Riddle
[4863]364    He sat down, gripping his hands together very tightly
[4864]6027   My dear boy, said Dipper kindly, I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer
[4865]479    Surely you want to go home for the holidays
[4866]5221  No, said Riddle at once
[4867]1204    I'd much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that - to that-You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe
[4868]5111   said Dippet curiously
[4869]5823   Yes, sir, said Riddle, reddening slightly
[4870]129   You are Muggle-born
[4871]5637  Half-blood, sir, said Riddle
[4872]362    Muggle father, witch mother
[4873]60   And are both your parents -
[4874]1126  My mother died just after I was born, sir
[4875]1632    They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather
[4876]24   Dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically
[4877]663   The thing is, Tom, he sighed, Special arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstancesYou mean all these attacks, sir
[4878]16016   said Riddle, and Harry's heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything
[4879]5150   Precisely, said the headmaster
[4880]433    My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends
[4881]889    Particularly in light of the recent tragedy the death of that poor little girl You will be safer by far at your orphanage
[4882]993    As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school
[4883]5413    We are no nearer locating the - er - source of all this unpleasantnessRiddle's eyes had widened
[4884]671   Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped-What do you mean
[4885]5875   said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair
[4886]1157    Riddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks
[4887]5519  No, sir, said Riddle quickly
[4888]6924   But Harry was sure it was the same sort of no that he himself had given Dumbledore
[4889]690   Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed
[4890]616   You may go, TomRiddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room
[4891]5853    Harry followed him
[4892]508   Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor
[4893]6796    Riddle stopped, and so did Harry, watching him
[4894]6469    Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking
[4895]76    He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed
[4896]6063   Then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly behind him
[4897]4270    They didn't see another person until they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase
[4898]258   What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom
[4899]5887  Harry gaped at the wizard
[4900]1039    He was none other than a fifty-year-younger Dumbledore
[4901]5419   I had to see the headmaster, sir, said Riddle
[4902]12538   Well, hurry off to bed, said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well
[4903]215    Best not to roam the corridors these days
[4904]798    Not sinceHe sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off
[4905]6726    Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit
[4906]17068   But to Harry's disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with Snape
[4907]10716    The torches hadn't been lit, and when Riddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just see him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside
[4908]6088   It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour
[4909]1711    All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue
[4910]7833    And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present, he heard something move beyond the door
[4911]29   Someone was creeping along the passage
[4912]505    He heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden
[4913]9269    Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind him, forgetting that he couldn't be heard
[4914]1340   For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddle stopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises
[4915]6835    Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper
[4916]530   C'mon gotta get yeh outta here C'mon now in the boxThere was something familiar about that voiceRiddle suddenly jumped around the corner
[4917]5794    Harry stepped out behind him
[4918]1482    He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it
[4919]5362   Evening, Rubeus, said Riddle sharply
[4920]918   The boy slammed the door shut and stood up
[4921]51   What yer doin'down here, Tom
[4922]238  Riddle stepped closer
[4923]9836   It's all over, he said
[4924]1004    I'm going to have to turn you in, Rubeus
[4925]3503    They're talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don't stop
[4926]4400   N at d'yeh-I don't think you meant to kill anyone
[4927]3498    But monsters don't make good pets
[4928]1229    I suppose you just let it out for exercise and-It never killed no one
[4929]6041   said the large boy, backing against the closed door
[4930]6013    From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking
[4931]5798   Come on, Rubeus, said Riddle, moving yet closer
[4932]5004    The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow
[4933]3347    The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughteredIt wasn't him
[4934]1069   roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark passage
[4935]113    He wouldn'
[4936]0   He never
[4937]5767  Stand aside, said Riddle, drawing out his wand
[4938]394   His spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light
[4939]1414    The door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite
[4940]6661    And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone
[4941]1814   A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers - Riddle raised his wand again, but he was too late
[4942]772    The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight
[4943]2306    Riddle scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down, yelling, NOOOOOO
[4944]11841  The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle's diary lying open on his stomach
[4945]3593   Before he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door opened and Ron came in
[4946]5086   There you are, he said
[4947]5865   Harry sat up
[4948]102    He was sweating and shaking
[4949]4750   What's up
[4950]7703   said Ron, looking at him with concern
[4951]2654   It was Hagrid, Ron
[4952]1271    Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago

[4959]746    Lionfish 11/Nov/2007     Chapter Fourteen     Cornelius FudgeContents  Prev Chapter  Next Chapter  
[4960]10320     Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures
[4961]2782    During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he'd christened Fluffy
[4962]7960    And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was sure he'd have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it
[4963]9865    He'd probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it
[4964]842    But he was equally certain that Hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody
[4965]13404   Harry half wished he hadn't found out how to work Riddle's diary
[4966]5103    Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what he'd seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed
[4967]7683   Riddle might have got the wrong person, said Hermione
[4968]1538    Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking peopleHow many monsters d'you think this place can hold
[4969]2380   Ron asked dully
[4970]11816   We always knew Hagrid had been expelled, said Harry miserably
[4971]1511    And the attacks must've stopped after Hagrid was kicked out
[4972]3256    Otherwise, Riddle wouldn't have got his award
[4973]2175   Ron tried a different tack
[4974]2194   Riddle does sound like Percy - who asked him to squeal on Hagrid, anyway
[4975]8760  But the monster had killed someone, Ron, said Hermione
[4976]11887   And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts, said Harry
[4977]12245    I don't blame him for wanting to stay hereYou met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn't you, Harry
[4978]11026  He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent, said Harry quickly
[4979]200   The three of them fell silent
[4980]2593    After a long pause, Hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice
[4981]1324   Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all
[4982]7750  That'd be a cheerful visit, said Ron
[4983]688     Hello, Hagrid
[4984]589    Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately
[4985]2486  'In the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled
[4986]1563    It was now nearly four months since Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good
[4987]8473    Peeves had finally got bored of his Oh, Potter, you rotter song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three
[4988]845    This made Professor Sprout very happy
[4989]12745   The moment they start trying to move into each other's pots, we'll know they're fully mature, she told Harry
[4990]1149    Then we'll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing
[4991]1155   The second years were given something new to think about during their Easter holidays
[4992]3141    The time had come to choose their subjects for the third year, a matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously
[4993]8240   it could affect our whole future, she told Harry and Ron as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks
[4994]12019   I just want to give up Potions, said Harry
[4995]9407   We can't, said Ron gloomily
[4996]1904    We keep all our old subjects, or I'd've ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts
[4997]4800   But that's very important
[4998]6728   said Hermione, shocked
[4999]7649   Not the way Lockhart teaches it, said Ron
[5000]2617    I haven't learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose
[5001]811   Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose
[5002]1246    Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes
[5003]7656    Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on
[5004]6621    Hermione took nobody's advice but signed up for everything
[5005]7129   Harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them
[5006]3499    Not that he didn't get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager to share his experience
[5007]11155   Depends where you want to go, Harry, he said
[5008]6018    It's never too early to think about the future, so I'd recommend Divination
[5009]3101    People say Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if they're thinking of working in close contact with them - look at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time
[5010]467    My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures
[5011]5757    Play to your strengths, Harry
[5012]6974   But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch
[5013]3346    In the end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at them, at least he'd have someone friendly to help him
[5014]5169   Gryffindor's next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff
[5015]6985    Wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework
[5016]10995    However, the training sessions were getting better, or at least drier, and the evening before Saturday's match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor's chances for the Quidditch cup had never been better
[5017]3109   But his cheerful mood didn't last long
[5018]1144    At the top of the stairs to the dormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic
[5019]17896   Harry - I don't know who did it - I just found-Watching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the door
[5020]10595   The contents of Harry's trunk had been thrown everywhere
[5021]460    His cloak lay ripped on the floor
[5022]432    The bedclothes had been pulled off his four-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress
[5023]6377   Harry walked over to the bed, open-mouthed, treading on a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls
[5024]3028    As he and Neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in
[5025]211    Dean swore loudly
[5026]5875   What happened, Harry
[5027]10929  No idea, said Harry
[5028]12654    But Ron was examining Harry's robes
[5029]56    All the pockets were hanging out
[5030]12443   Someone's been looking for something, said Ron
[5031]18    Is there anything missing
[5032]6094  Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk
[5033]2816    It was only as he threw the last of the Lockhart books back into it that he realized what wasn't there
[5034]16937   Riddle's diary's gone, he said in an undertone to Ron
[5035]0   What
[5036]8908  Harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followed him out
[5037]3074    They hurried down to the Gryffindor common room, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy 
[5038]2351   Hermione looked aghast at the news
[5039]11195   But - only a Gryffindor could have stolen - nobody else knows our password-Exactly, said Harry
[5040]357   They woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing breeze
[5041]171   Perfect Quidditch conditions
[5042]10452   said Wood enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table, loading the team's plates with scrambled eggs
[5043]5982    Harry, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast
[5044]12514   Harry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering if the new owner of Riddle's diary was right in front of his eyes
[5045]10926    Hermione had been urging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn't like the idea
[5046]2669    He'd have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and how many people knew why Hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago
[5047]3083   He didn't want to be the one who brought it all up again
[5048]15326   As he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Harry's growing list
[5049]1365    He had just set foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet again
[5050]5142   Kill this time let me rip tearHe shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from him in alarm
[5051]539   The voice
[5052]11537   said Harry, -looking over his shoulder
[5053]3787    I just heard it again - didn't you
[5054]2649  Ron shook his head, wide-eyed
[5055]2034    Hermione, however, clapped a hand to her forehead
[5056]7823   Harry - I think I've just understood something
[5057]1416   I've got to go to the library
[5058]439  And she sprinted away, up the stairs
[5059]177   What does she understand
[5060]12972   said Harry distractedly, still looking around, trying to tell where the voice had come from
[5061]7703   Loads more than I do, said Ron, shaking his head
[5062]5473   But why's she got to go to the library
[5063]13557  Because that's what Hermione does, said Ron, shrugging
[5064]60    When in doubt, go to the library
[5065]8433   Harry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were now emerging from the Great Hall behind him, talking loudly, exiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch
[5066]7988   You'd better get moving, said Ron
[5067]13156    It's nearly eleven - the match-Harry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds, but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room, his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game
[5068]205   The teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause
[5069]496    Oliver Wood took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; Madam Hooch released the balls
[5070]333    The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics
[5071]8468   Harry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGonagall came half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone
[5072]11499   Harry's heart dropped like a stone
[5073]1226   This match has been cancelled, Professor McGonagall called through the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium
[5074]9    There were boos and shouts
[5075]1924    Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and ran toward Professor McGonagall without getting off his broomstick
[5076]751   But, Professor
[5077]135   he shouted
[5078]3927    We've got to play - the cup - Gryffindor-Professor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her megaphone:All students are to make their way back to the House common rooms, where their Heads of Houses will give them further information
[5079]155    As quickly as you can, please
[5080]5778  Then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her
[5081]11534   Potter, I think you'd better come with meWondering how she could possibly suspect him this time, Harry saw Ron detach himself from the complaining crowd; he came running up to them as they set off toward the castle
[5082]14245    To Harry's surprise, Professor McGonagall didn't object
[5083]2466   Yes, perhaps you'd better come, too, WeasleySome of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled; others looked worried
[5084]9167    Harry and Ron followed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase
[5085]7931    But they weren't taken to anybody's office this time
[5086]6899   This will be a bit of a shock, said Professor McGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary
[5087]164    There has been another attack another double attack
[5088]11227   Harry's insides did a horrible somersault
[5089]3876    Professor McGonagall pushed the door open and he and Ron entered
[5090]0    
[5091]960    Madam Pomfrey was bending over a fifth-year girl with long, curly hair
[5092]7467    Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they'd accidentally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room
[5093]1792    And on the bed next to her was-Hermione
[5094]2019   Ron groaned
[5095]2434   Hermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy
[5096]6171   They were found near the library, said Professor McGonagall
[5097]3042    I don't suppose either of you can explain this
[5098]563   It was on the floor next to themShe was holding up a small, circular mirror
[5099]9656   Harry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Hermione
[5100]6382   I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower, said Professor McGonagall heavily
[5101]398    I need to address the students in any case
[5102]771   All students will return to their House common rooms by six o'clock in the evening
[5103]725    No student is to leave the dormitories after that time
[5104]141    You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher
[5105]230    No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher
[5106]173    All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed
[5107]84    There will be no more evening activities
[5108]1901   The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor McGonagall in silence
[5109]6100    She rolled up the parchment from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice, I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed
[5110]512    It is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught
[5111]1326    I would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them to come forward
[5112]476   She climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and the Gryffindors began talking immediately
[5113]11015   That's two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, one Ravenclaw, and one Hufflepuff,  said the Weasley twins'friend Lee Jordan, counting on his fingers
[5114]2643    Haven't any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe
[5115]7502   Isn't it obvious all this stuff's coming from Slytherin
[5116]4155   The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin - why don't they just chuck all the Slytherins out
[5117]69   he roared, to nods and scattered applause
[5118]4240   Percy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once he didn't seem keen to make his views heard
[5119]675    He was looking pale and stunned
[5120]11477   Percy's in shock, George told Harry quietly
[5121]4912    That Ravenclaw girl - Penelope Clearwater - she's a prefect
[5122]4065    I don't think he thought the monster would dare attack a prefect
[5123]5967   But Harry was only half-listening
[5124]4962    He didn't seem to be able to get rid of the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone
[5125]3310    And if the culprit wasn't caught soon, he was looking at a lifetime back with the Dursleys
[5126]1619    Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed
[5127]6391    Harry now knew exactly how he had felt
[5128]489   What're we going to do
[5129]17768   said Ron quietly in Harry's ear
[5130]1839    D'you think they suspect Hagrid
[5131]12578  We've got to go and talk to him, said Harry, making up his mind
[5132]14965    I can't believe it's him this time, but if he set the monster loose last time he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start
[5133]28976   But McGonagall said we've got to stay in our tower unless we're in class-I think, said Harry, more quietly still, it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again
[5134]7319   Harry had inherited just one thing from his father: a long and silvery Invisibility Cloak
[5135]994    It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it
[5136]2771    They went to bed at the usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and Seamus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally fallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak over themselves
[5137]2978   The journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors wasn't enjoyable
[5138]6311    Harry, who had wandered the castle at night several times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset
[5139]353    Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity
[5140]6315    Their Invisibility Cloak didn't stop them making any noise, and there was a particularly tense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where Snape stood standing guard
[5141]2859    Thankfully, Snape sneezed at almost exactly the moment Ron swore
[5142]525    It was with relief that they reached the oak front doors and eased them open
[5143]257   It was a clear, starry night
[5144]7227    They hurried toward the lit windows of Hagrid's house and pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside his front door
[5145]1039   Seconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open
[5146]1057    They found themselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them
[5147]227    Fang the boarhound barked loudly behind him
[5148]5668   Oh, he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them
[5149]6    What're you two doin'here
[5150]4750  What's that for
[5151]11186   said Harry, pointing at the crossbow as they stepped inside
[5152]767   Nothin'- nothin'- Hagrid muttered
[5153]2774    I've bin expectin'- doesn'matter - Sit down - I'll make tea-He hardly seemed to know what he was doing
[5154]648    He nearly extinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand
[5155]674   Are you okay, Hagrid
[5156]10818   said Harry
[5157]2471    Did you hear about Hermione
[5158]6996  Oh, I heard, all righ', said Hagrid, a slight break in his voice
[5159]244   He kept glancing nervously at the windows
[5160]1866    He poured them both large mugs of boiling water (he had forgotten to add tea bags) and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door
[5161]728   Hagrid dropped the fruitcake
[5162]8147    Harry and Ron exchanged panicstricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner
[5163]1553    Hagrid checked that they were hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door once more
[5164]1077   Good evening, Hagrid
[5165]817   It was Dumbledore
[5166]1756    He entered, looking deadly serious, and was followed by a second, very odd-looking man
[5167]1280   The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, a scarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots
[5168]231    Under his arm he carried a lime-green bowler
[5169]9616   That's Dad's boss
[5170]2024   Ron breathed
[5171]511    Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic
[5172]8219  Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up
[5173]840   Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty
[5174]1828    He dropped into one of his chairs and looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge
[5175]6078   Bad business, Hagrid, said Fudge in rather clipped tones
[5176]130    Very bad business
[5177]436    Had to come
[5178]128    Four attacks on Muggle-borns
[5179]1096    Things've gone far enough
[5180]5685    Ministry's got to act
[5181]7164   I never, said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore
[5182]9686    You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir-I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence, said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge
[5183]5772   Look, Albus, said Fudge, uncomfortably
[5184]10163    Hagrid's record's against him
[5185]13479    Ministry's got to do something - the school governors have been in touch-Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in the slightest, said Dumbledore
[5186]6451    His blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen before
[5187]5882   Look at it from my point of view, said Fudge, fidgeting with his bowler
[5188]541    I'm under a lot of pressure
[5189]1055    Got to be seen to be doing something
[5190]8766    If it turns out it wasn't Hagrid, he'll be back and no more said
[5191]1383    But I've got to take him
[5192]690    Got to
[5193]2616    Wouldn't be doing my duty-Take me
[5194]5777   said Hagrid, who was trembling
[5195]0    Take me where
[5196]11310  For a short stretch only, said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid's eyes
[5197]665    Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution
[5198]1042    If someone else is caught, you'll be let out with a full apology-Not Azkaban
[5199]668   croaked Hagrid
[5200]858   Before Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door
[5201]833   Dumbledore answered it
[5202]11540    It was Harry's turn for an elbow in the ribs; he'd let out an audible gasp
[5203]372   Mr
[5204]6913    Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid's hut, swathed in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile
[5205]190    Fang started to growl
[5206]5285   Already here, Fudge, he said approvingly
[5207]350    Good, goodWhat're you doin'here
[5208]5787   said Hagrid furiously
[5209]222    Get outta my house
[5210]1483  My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your - er - d'you call this a house
[5211]6455   said Lucius Malfoy, sneering as he looked around the small cabin
[5212]765    I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here
[5213]1157   And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius
[5214]5903   said Dumbledore
[5215]619    He spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes
[5216]12689   Dreadful thing, Dumbledore, said Malfoy lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside
[5217]724    This is an Order of Suspension - you'll find all twelve signatures on it
[5218]661    I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch
[5219]20    How many attacks have there been now
[5220]2488   Two more this afternoon, wasn't it
[5221]2215   At this rate, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school
[5222]8482   Oh, now, see here, Lucius, said Fudge, looking alarmed, Dumbledore suspended - no, no - last thing we want just now
[5223]5811   The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge, said Mr
[5224]458    Malfoy smoothly
[5225]10502    And as Dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks-See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can't stop them, said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, I mean to say, who can
[5226]5647  That remains to be seen, said Mr
[5227]570    Malfoy with a nasty smile
[5228]1756    But as all twelve of us have voted-Hagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling
[5229]1435   An'how many did yeh have ter threaten an'blackmail before they agreed, Malfoy, eh
[5230]47   he roared
[5231]7261   Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, Hagrid, said Mr
[5232]440    Malfoy
[5233]815    I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that
[5234]3178    They won't like it at all
[5235]947   Yeh can'take Dumbledore
[5236]926   yelled Hagrid, making Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his basket
[5237]710    Take him away, an'the Muggle-borns won'stand a chance
[5238]570   There'll be killin'next
[5239]6641  Calm yourself, Hagrid, said Dumbledore sharply
[5240]1170    He looked at Lucius Malfoy
[5241]892   If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside-But - stuttered Fudge
[5242]0   No
[5243]684   growled Hagrid
[5244]6873   Dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy's cold gray ones
[5245]7377   However, said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word, you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it
[5246]14311   For a second, Harry was almost sure Dumbledore's eyes flickered toward the corner where he and Ron were hidden
[5247]5535   Admirable sentiments, said Malfoy, bowing
[5248]931    We shall all miss your - er - highly individual way of running things, Albus, and only hope your successor willl manage to prevent any - ah - killins
[5249]1584   He strode to the cabin door, opened it, and bowed Dumbledore out
[5250]8793    Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waited for Hagrid to go ahead of him, but Hagrid stood his ground, took a deep breath, and said carefully, If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they'd have ter do would be ter follow the spiders
[5251]1247    That'd lead em right
[5252]5194    That's all I'm sayin'
[5253]328   Fudge stared at him in amazement
[5254]6823   All right, I'm comin', said Hagrid, pulling on his moleskin overcoat
[5255]7828    But as he was about to follow Fudge through the door, he stopped again and said loudly, An'someone'll need ter feed Fang while I'm away
[5256]2908   The door banged shut and Ron pulled off the Invisibility Cloak
[5257]7166   We're in trouble now, Ron said hoarsely
[5258]817    No Dumbledore
[5259]367    They might as well close the school tonight
[5260]922    There'll be an attack a day with him gone
[5261]815   Fang started howling, scratching at the closed door

[5270]696    Lionfish 11/Nov/2007     Chapter Fifteen     AragogContents  Prev Chapter  Next Chapter  
[5271]1019     Summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses
[5272]11295    But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn't look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong
[5273]9629   Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing
[5274]1138   We're taking no more chances, Madam Pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door
[5275]7657    No, I'm sorry, there's every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people offWith Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows
[5276]4585    There was barely a face to be seen in the school that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled
[5277]12579   Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to himself I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it
[5278]453    But what good were these words
[5279]1312   Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were
[5280]5721  Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand
[5281]3256    The trouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow
[5282]8632    Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron
[5283]2859    They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors
[5284]6282    Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome
[5285]158   One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion
[5286]2166    Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy
[5287]17442    Harry didn't realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle
[5288]7650   I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore, he said, not troubling to keep his voice down
[5289]11006    I told you he thinks Dumbledore's the worst headmaster the school's ever had
[5290]713    Maybe we'll get a decent headmaster now
[5291]3044    Someone who won't want the Chamber of Secrets closed
[5292]20330    McGonagall won't last long, she's only filling inSnape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione's empty seat and cauldron
[5293]5805   Sir, said Malfoy loudly
[5294]7943    Sir, why don't you apply for the headmaster's job
[5295]8548  Now, now, Malfoy, said Snape, though he couldn't suppress a thin-lipped smile
[5296]1591    Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors
[5297]651    I daresay he'll be back with us soon enough
[5298]6383   Yeah, right, said Malfoy, smirking
[5299]7935    I expect you'd have Father's vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job - I'll tell Father you're the best teacher here, sir-Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron
[5300]3800   I'm quite surprised the Mudbloods haven't all packed their bags by now, Malfoy went on
[5301]68    Bet you five Galleons the next one dies
[5302]11035    Pity it wasn't Granger-The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy's last words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags and books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed
[5303]8266   Let me at him, Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms
[5304]24743    I don't care, I don't need my wand, I'm going to kill him with my bare hands-Hurry up, I've got to take you all to Herbology, barked Snape over the class's heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose
[5305]1634    It was only safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses
[5306]1923   The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing from their number, Justin and Hermione
[5307]1038   Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian Shrivelfigs
[5308]7110    Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan
[5309]13226    Ernie took a deep breath and said, very formally, I just want to say, Harry, that I'm sorry I ever suspected you
[5310]8280    I know you'd never attack Hermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I said
[5311]6220    We're all in the same boat now, and, well-He held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it
[5312]8208   Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron
[5313]8263   That Draco Malfoy character, said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs, he seems very pleased about all this, doesn't he
[5314]6883   D'you know, I think he might be Slytherin's heir
[5315]20371   That's clever of you, said Ron, who didn't seem to have forgiven Ernie as readily as Harry
[5316]11484   Do you think it's Malfoy, Harry
[5317]424   Ernie asked
[5318]11071   No, said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared
[5319]6043   A second later, Harry spotted something
[5320]935   Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting
[5321]8194    Harry hit Ron over the hand with his pruning shears
[5322]12   Ouch
[5323]6470   What're you-Harry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun
[5324]8484   Oh, yeah, said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased
[5325]2504    But we can't follow them now-Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously
[5326]11052   Harry's eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders
[5327]493    If they pursued their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would end up
[5328]3560   Looks like they're heading for the Forbidden ForestAnd Ron looked even unhappier about that
[5329]1678   At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson
[5330]7862    Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot
[5331]8850   We'll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again, Harry told Ron
[5332]71    We can take Fang with us
[5333]6216    He's used to going into the forest with Hagrid, he might be some help
[5334]8167   Right, said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers
[5335]5051    Er - aren't there - aren't there supposed to be werewolves in the forest
[5336]5411   he added as they took their usual places at the back of Lockhart's classroom
[5337]11422   Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, There are good things in there, too
[5338]734    The centaurs are all right, and the unicornsRon had never been into the Forbidden Forest before
[5339]5828    Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again
[5340]923   Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him
[5341]1315    Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but Lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant
[5342]517   Come now, he cried, beaming around him
[5343]397    Why all these long faces
[5344]430  People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered
[5345]9067   Don't you people realize, said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as though they were all a bit dim, the danger has passed
[5346]517   The culprit has been taken away-Says who
[5347]5309   said Dean Thomas loudly
[5348]11669   My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn't have taken Hagrid if he hadn't been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty, said Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two
[5349]7946   Oh, yes he would, said Ron, even more loudly than Dean
[5350]6587   I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid's arrest than you do, Mr
[5351]5992    Weasley, said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone
[5352]11847   Ron started to say that he didn't think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk
[5353]2460   We weren't there, remember
[5354]5839   Harry muttered
[5355]18493   But Lockhart's disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always thought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole business was now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart's stupid face
[5356]7247    Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let's do it tonight
[5357]4831   Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione
[5358]163    The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded
[5359]1016   The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o'clock onward the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go
[5360]3571    They also had plenty to talk about, with the result that the common room often didn't empty until past midnight
[5361]7585   Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear
[5362]15766    Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in Hermione's usual chair
[5363]10043    Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed
[5364]8235   Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole
[5365]249   It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers
[5366]1104    At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds
[5367]12537   Course, said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow
[5368]1247    Those spiders might not've been going there at all
[5369]3315    I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, butHis voice trailed away hopefully
[5370]6554   They reached Hagrid's house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows
[5371]6983    When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them
[5372]608    Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together
[5373]11740   Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid's table
[5374]659    There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest
[5375]12372   C'mon, Fang, we're going for a walk, said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree
[5376]6372   Harry took out his wand, murmured, Lumos
[5377]1849   and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders
[5378]7519   Good thinking, said Ron
[5379]4491    I'd light mine, too, but you know - it'd probably blow up or somethingHarry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass
[5380]537    Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees
[5381]2621   Okay, Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, I'm ready
[5382]5070    Let's go
[5383]356   So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, they entered the forest
[5384]11224    By the glow of Harry's wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path
[5385]631    They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves
[5386]11863    Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and Harry's wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path
[5387]7404   Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside his little sphere of light was pitch-black
[5388]188    He had never been this deep into the forest before
[5389]2199    He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he'd been in here
[5390]6446    But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders
[5391]22698   Something wet touched Harry's hand and he jumped backward, crushing Ron's foot, but it was only Fang's nose
[5392]671   What d'you reckon
[5393]14865   Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand
[5394]8357   We've come this far, said Ron
[5395]279   So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees
[5396]3159    They couldn't move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness
[5397]11168    Harry could feel Fang's hot breath on his hand
[5398]5942    More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight
[5399]1408   They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles
[5400]268    After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever
[5401]8661   Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins
[5402]0   What
[5403]18875   said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping Harry's elbow very hard
[5404]10600   There's something moving over there, Harry breathed
[5405]861    Listen sounds like something bigThey listened
[5406]770    Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees
[5407]7450   Oh, no, said Ron
[5408]12027    Oh, no, oh, no, oh-Shut up, said Harry frantically
[5409]756    It'll hear you
[5410]189   Hear me
[5411]7748   said Ron in an unnaturally high voice
[5412]5092    It's already heard Fang
[5413]338  The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood, terrified, waiting
[5414]194    There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence
[5415]6115   What d'you think it's doing
[5416]10818   said Harry
[5417]7350   Probably getting ready to pounce, said Ron
[5418]103   They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move
[5419]6062   D'you think it's gone
[5420]5855   Harry whispered
[5421]1793   Dunno-Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes
[5422]1021    Fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder
[5423]5732   Harry
[5424]13330   Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief Harry, it's our car
[5425]0  What
[5426]436  Come on
[5427]8345  Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing
[5428]372   Mr
[5429]5842    Weasley's car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze
[5430]3711    As Ron walked, open-mouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him, exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner
[5431]5306   It's been here all the time
[5432]7267   said Ron delightedly, walking around the car
[5433]457    Look at it
[5434]5351    The forest's turned it wildThe sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud
[5435]250    Apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own
[5436]8883    Fang didn't seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who could feel him quivering
[5437]6348    His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed his wand back into his robes
[5438]942   And we thought it was going to attack us
[5439]7245   said Ron, leaning against the car and patting it
[5440]170    I wondered where it had gone
[5441]6320  Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders, but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights
[5442]5844   We've lost the trail, he said
[5443]5129    C'mon, let's go and find them
[5444]4786   Ron didn't speak
[5445]2708    He didn't move
[5446]7504    His eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry
[5447]552    His face was livid with terror
[5448]9066   Harry didn't even have time to turn around
[5449]1215    There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown
[5450]9153    Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron's legs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling - next moment, he was being swept away into the dark trees
[5451]7542   Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers
[5452]2327    Behind him, he could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron
[5453]302    They were moving into the very heart of the forest
[5454]15610    Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn't have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing
[5455]6064   He never knew how long he was in the creature's clutches; he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders
[5456]1059    Craning his neck sideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on
[5457]65   Spiders
[5458]891    Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below
[5459]397    Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic
[5460]6537    The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load
[5461]6028   Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him
[5462]2078    Ron and Fang thudded down next to him
[5463]2592    Fang wasn't howling anymore, but cowering silently on the spot
[5464]9525    Ron looked exactly like Harry felt
[5465]953    His mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping
[5466]6050   Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something
[5467]681    It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke
[5468]39   Aragog
[5469]119   it called
[5470]39    Aragog
[5471]460  And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small elephant emerged, very slowly
[5472]1502    There was gray in the black of his body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white
[5473]4    He was blind
[5474]0   What is it
[5475]5146   he said, clicking his pincers rapidly
[5476]5880   Men, clicked the spider who had caught Harry
[5477]652   Is it Hagrid
[5478]5781   said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely
[5479]2084   Strangers, clicked the spider who had brought Ron
[5480]145   Kill them, clicked Aragog fretfully
[5481]11331    I was sleepingWe're friends of Hagrid's, Harry shouted
[5482]472    His heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat
[5483]334   Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow
[5484]68   Aragog paused
[5485]5979   Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before, he said slowly
[5486]16398   Hagrid's in trouble, said Harry, breathing very fast
[5487]5879    That's why we've come
[5488]68   In trouble
[5489]11601   said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers
[5490]78    But why has he sent you
[5491]9890  Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn't think his legs would support him
[5492]209    So he spoke from the ground, as calmly as he could
[5493]6357   They think, up at the school, that Hagrid's been setting a - a - something on students
[5494]824    They've taken him to Azkaban
[5495]10065   Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause, except applause didn't usually make Harry feel sick with fear
[5496]5375   But that was years ago, said Aragog fretfully
[5497]413    Years and years ago
[5498]105    I remember it well
[5499]5097    That's why they made him leave the school
[5500]211    They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets
[5501]1503    They thought that Hagrid had opened the Chamber and set me free
[5502]3307   And you you didn't come from the Chamber of Secrets
[5503]11102   said Harry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead
[5504]0   I
[5505]5237   said Aragog, clicking angrily
[5506]145    I was not born in the castle
[5507]474    I come from a distant land
[5508]900    A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg
[5509]1196    Hagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table
[5510]1520    Hagrid is my good friend, and a good man
[5511]250    When I was discovered, and blamed for the death of a girl, he protected me
[5512]781    I have lived here in the forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me
[5513]5565    He even found me a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through Hagrid's goodnessHarry summoned what remained of his courage
[5514]58   So you never - never attacked anyone
[5515]226  Never, croaked the old spider
[5516]705    It would have been my instinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human
[5517]211    The body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom
[5518]497    I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up
[5519]2717    Our kind like the dark and the quietBut then Do you know what did kill that girl
[5520]10818   said Harry
[5521]6335    Because whatever it is, it's back and attacking people again-His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted all around him
[5522]5591   The thing that lives in the castle, said Aragog, is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others
[5523]1411    Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school
[5524]0   What is it
[5525]10841   said Harry urgently
[5526]217   More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in
[5527]76   We do not speak of it
[5528]5144   said Aragog fiercely
[5529]0    We do not name it
[5530]1441   I never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many times
[5531]8963   Harry didn't want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides
[5532]204    Aragog seemed to be tired of talking
[5533]8215    He was backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron
[5534]7392   We'll just go, then, Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind him
[5535]0   Go
[5536]5251   said Aragog slowly
[5537]1241    I think notBut - but-My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command
[5538]57    But I cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our midst
[5539]1067    Good-bye, friend of Hagrid
[5540]5740   Harry spun around
[5541]1707    Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wall of spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads
[5542]7939   Even as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good, there were too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow
[5543]372   Mr
[5544]5990    Weasley's car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring, its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto their backs, their endless legs waving in the air
[5545]8287    The car screeched to a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open
[5546]71   Get Fang
[5547]16318   Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of the car - the doors slammed shut - Ron didn't touch the accelerator but the car didn't need him; the engine roared and they were off, hitting more spiders
[5548]1221    They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and they were soon crashing through the forest, branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew
[5549]8459   Harry looked sideways at Ron
[5550]3371    His mouth was still open in the silent scream, but his eyes weren't popping anymore
[5551]22   Are you okay
[5552]2379  Ron stared straight ahead, unable to speak
[5553]7179   They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak
[5554]5985    After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky
[5555]496   The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield
[5556]288    They had reached the edge of the forest
[5557]12515    Fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid's house, tail between his legs
[5558]8949    Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring
[5559]6290    Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view
[5560]11497   Harry went back into Hagrid's cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak
[5561]122    Fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket
[5562]8642    When Harry got outside again, he found Ron being violent sick in the pumpkin patch
[5563]7423   Follow the spiders, said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve
[5564]1224    I'll never forgive Hagrid
[5565]67    We're lucky to be alive
[5566]13828   I bet he thought Aragog wouldn't hurt friends of his, said Harry
[5567]10283   That's exactly Hagrid's problem
[5568]7276   said Ron, thumping the wall of the cabin
[5569]8408    He always thinks monsters aren't as bad as they're made out, and look where it's got him
[5570]57   A cell in Azkaban
[5571]24   He was shivering uncontrollably now
[5572]105    What was the point of sending us in there
[5573]2126   What have we found out, I'd like to know
[5574]14304  That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets, said Harry, throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk
[5575]19    He was innocent
[5576]2327   Ron gave a loud snort
[5577]2667    Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard wasn't his idea of being innocent
[5578]6865   As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar
[5579]968    They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking
[5580]917    At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash
[5581]390    They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory
[5582]2336   Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed
[5583]8574    Harry, however, didn't feel very sleepy
[5584]5566    He sat on the edge of his fourposter, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said
[5585]4707   The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort -even other monsters didn't want to name it
[5586]2079    But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it was, or how it petrified its victims
[5587]857    Even Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets
[5588]6450   Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window
[5589]2437   He couldn't see what else they could do
[5590]202    They had hit dead ends everywhere
[5591]2538    Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time
[5592]110    There was nobody else to ask
[5593]11024    Harry lay down, still thinking about what Aragog had said
[5594]1083   He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright
[5595]18120   Ron, he hissed through the dark, Ron-Ron woke with a yelp like Fang's, stared wildly around, and saw Harry
[5596]2121   Ron - that girl who died
[5597]21152    Aragog said she was found in a bathroom, said Harry, ignoring Neville's snuffling snores from the corner
[5598]305    What if she never left the bathroom
[5599]4750   What if she's still there
[5600]2543  Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight
[5601]28    And then he understood, too
[5602]3584   You don't think - not Moaning Myrtle

[5622]696    Lionfish 11/Nov/2007     Chapter Fifteen     AragogContents  Prev Chapter  Next Chapter  
[5623]1019     Summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses
[5624]11295    But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn't look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong
[5625]9629   Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing
[5626]1138   We're taking no more chances, Madam Pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door
[5627]7657    No, I'm sorry, there's every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people offWith Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows
[5628]4585    There was barely a face to be seen in the school that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled
[5629]12579   Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to himself I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it
[5630]453    But what good were these words
[5631]1312   Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were
[5632]5721  Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand
[5633]3256    The trouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow
[5634]8632    Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron
[5635]2859    They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors
[5636]6282    Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome
[5637]158   One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion
[5638]2166    Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy
[5639]17442    Harry didn't realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle
[5640]7650   I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore, he said, not troubling to keep his voice down
[5641]11006    I told you he thinks Dumbledore's the worst headmaster the school's ever had
[5642]713    Maybe we'll get a decent headmaster now
[5643]3044    Someone who won't want the Chamber of Secrets closed
[5644]20330    McGonagall won't last long, she's only filling inSnape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione's empty seat and cauldron
[5645]5805   Sir, said Malfoy loudly
[5646]7943    Sir, why don't you apply for the headmaster's job
[5647]8548  Now, now, Malfoy, said Snape, though he couldn't suppress a thin-lipped smile
[5648]1591    Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors
[5649]651    I daresay he'll be back with us soon enough
[5650]6383   Yeah, right, said Malfoy, smirking
[5651]7935    I expect you'd have Father's vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job - I'll tell Father you're the best teacher here, sir-Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron
[5652]3800   I'm quite surprised the Mudbloods haven't all packed their bags by now, Malfoy went on
[5653]68    Bet you five Galleons the next one dies
[5654]11035    Pity it wasn't Granger-The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy's last words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags and books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed
[5655]8266   Let me at him, Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms
[5656]24743    I don't care, I don't need my wand, I'm going to kill him with my bare hands-Hurry up, I've got to take you all to Herbology, barked Snape over the class's heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose
[5657]1634    It was only safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses
[5658]1923   The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing from their number, Justin and Hermione
[5659]1038   Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian Shrivelfigs
[5660]7110    Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan
[5661]13226    Ernie took a deep breath and said, very formally, I just want to say, Harry, that I'm sorry I ever suspected you
[5662]8280    I know you'd never attack Hermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I said
[5663]6220    We're all in the same boat now, and, well-He held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it
[5664]8208   Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron
[5665]8263   That Draco Malfoy character, said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs, he seems very pleased about all this, doesn't he
[5666]6883   D'you know, I think he might be Slytherin's heir
[5667]20371   That's clever of you, said Ron, who didn't seem to have forgiven Ernie as readily as Harry
[5668]11484   Do you think it's Malfoy, Harry
[5669]424   Ernie asked
[5670]11071   No, said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared
[5671]6043   A second later, Harry spotted something
[5672]935   Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting
[5673]8194    Harry hit Ron over the hand with his pruning shears
[5674]12   Ouch
[5675]6470   What're you-Harry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun
[5676]8484   Oh, yeah, said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased
[5677]2504    But we can't follow them now-Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously
[5678]11052   Harry's eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders
[5679]493    If they pursued their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would end up
[5680]3560   Looks like they're heading for the Forbidden ForestAnd Ron looked even unhappier about that
[5681]1678   At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson
[5682]7862    Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot
[5683]8850   We'll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again, Harry told Ron
[5684]71    We can take Fang with us
[5685]6216    He's used to going into the forest with Hagrid, he might be some help
[5686]8167   Right, said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers
[5687]5051    Er - aren't there - aren't there supposed to be werewolves in the forest
[5688]5411   he added as they took their usual places at the back of Lockhart's classroom
[5689]11422   Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, There are good things in there, too
[5690]734    The centaurs are all right, and the unicornsRon had never been into the Forbidden Forest before
[5691]5828    Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again
[5692]923   Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him
[5693]1315    Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but Lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant
[5694]517   Come now, he cried, beaming around him
[5695]397    Why all these long faces
[5696]430  People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered
[5697]9067   Don't you people realize, said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as though they were all a bit dim, the danger has passed
[5698]517   The culprit has been taken away-Says who
[5699]5309   said Dean Thomas loudly
[5700]11669   My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn't have taken Hagrid if he hadn't been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty, said Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two
[5701]7946   Oh, yes he would, said Ron, even more loudly than Dean
[5702]6587   I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid's arrest than you do, Mr
[5703]5992    Weasley, said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone
[5704]11847   Ron started to say that he didn't think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk
[5705]2460   We weren't there, remember
[5706]5839   Harry muttered
[5707]18493   But Lockhart's disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always thought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole business was now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart's stupid face
[5708]7247    Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let's do it tonight
[5709]4831   Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione
[5710]163    The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded
[5711]1016   The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o'clock onward the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go
[5712]3571    They also had plenty to talk about, with the result that the common room often didn't empty until past midnight
[5713]7585   Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear
[5714]15766    Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in Hermione's usual chair
[5715]10043    Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed
[5716]8235   Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole
[5717]249   It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers
[5718]1104    At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds
[5719]12537   Course, said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow
[5720]1247    Those spiders might not've been going there at all
[5721]3315    I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, butHis voice trailed away hopefully
[5722]6554   They reached Hagrid's house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows
[5723]6983    When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them
[5724]608    Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together
[5725]11740   Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid's table
[5726]659    There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest
[5727]12372   C'mon, Fang, we're going for a walk, said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree
[5728]6372   Harry took out his wand, murmured, Lumos
[5729]1849   and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders
[5730]7519   Good thinking, said Ron
[5731]4491    I'd light mine, too, but you know - it'd probably blow up or somethingHarry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass
[5732]537    Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees
[5733]2621   Okay, Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, I'm ready
[5734]5070    Let's go
[5735]356   So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, they entered the forest
[5736]11224    By the glow of Harry's wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path
[5737]631    They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves
[5738]11863    Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and Harry's wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path
[5739]7404   Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside his little sphere of light was pitch-black
[5740]188    He had never been this deep into the forest before
[5741]2199    He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he'd been in here
[5742]6446    But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders
[5743]22698   Something wet touched Harry's hand and he jumped backward, crushing Ron's foot, but it was only Fang's nose
[5744]671   What d'you reckon
[5745]14865   Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand
[5746]8357   We've come this far, said Ron
[5747]279   So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees
[5748]3159    They couldn't move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness
[5749]11168    Harry could feel Fang's hot breath on his hand
[5750]5942    More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight
[5751]1408   They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles
[5752]268    After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever
[5753]8661   Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins
[5754]0   What
[5755]18875   said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping Harry's elbow very hard
[5756]10600   There's something moving over there, Harry breathed
[5757]861    Listen sounds like something bigThey listened
[5758]770    Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees
[5759]7450   Oh, no, said Ron
[5760]12027    Oh, no, oh, no, oh-Shut up, said Harry frantically
[5761]756    It'll hear you
[5762]189   Hear me
[5763]7748   said Ron in an unnaturally high voice
[5764]5092    It's already heard Fang
[5765]338  The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood, terrified, waiting
[5766]194    There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence
[5767]6115   What d'you think it's doing
[5768]10818   said Harry
[5769]7350   Probably getting ready to pounce, said Ron
[5770]103   They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move
[5771]6062   D'you think it's gone
[5772]5855   Harry whispered
[5773]1793   Dunno-Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes
[5774]1021    Fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder
[5775]5732   Harry
[5776]13330   Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief Harry, it's our car
[5777]0  What
[5778]436  Come on
[5779]8345  Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing
[5780]372   Mr
[5781]5842    Weasley's car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze
[5782]3711    As Ron walked, open-mouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him, exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner
[5783]5306   It's been here all the time
[5784]7267   said Ron delightedly, walking around the car
[5785]457    Look at it
[5786]5351    The forest's turned it wildThe sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud
[5787]250    Apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own
[5788]8883    Fang didn't seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who could feel him quivering
[5789]6348    His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed his wand back into his robes
[5790]942   And we thought it was going to attack us
[5791]7245   said Ron, leaning against the car and patting it
[5792]170    I wondered where it had gone
[5793]6320  Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders, but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights
[5794]5844   We've lost the trail, he said
[5795]5129    C'mon, let's go and find them
[5796]4786   Ron didn't speak
[5797]2708    He didn't move
[5798]7504    His eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry
[5799]552    His face was livid with terror
[5800]9066   Harry didn't even have time to turn around
[5801]1215    There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown
[5802]9153    Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron's legs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling - next moment, he was being swept away into the dark trees
[5803]7542   Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers
[5804]2327    Behind him, he could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron
[5805]302    They were moving into the very heart of the forest
[5806]15610    Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn't have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing
[5807]6064   He never knew how long he was in the creature's clutches; he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders
[5808]1059    Craning his neck sideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on
[5809]65   Spiders
[5810]891    Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below
[5811]397    Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic
[5812]6537    The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load
[5813]6028   Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him
[5814]2078    Ron and Fang thudded down next to him
[5815]2592    Fang wasn't howling anymore, but cowering silently on the spot
[5816]9525    Ron looked exactly like Harry felt
[5817]953    His mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping
[5818]6050   Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something
[5819]681    It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke
[5820]39   Aragog
[5821]119   it called
[5822]39    Aragog
[5823]460  And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small elephant emerged, very slowly
[5824]1502    There was gray in the black of his body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white
[5825]4    He was blind
[5826]0   What is it
[5827]5146   he said, clicking his pincers rapidly
[5828]5880   Men, clicked the spider who had caught Harry
[5829]652   Is it Hagrid
[5830]5781   said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely
[5831]2084   Strangers, clicked the spider who had brought Ron
[5832]145   Kill them, clicked Aragog fretfully
[5833]11331    I was sleepingWe're friends of Hagrid's, Harry shouted
[5834]472    His heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat
[5835]334   Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow
[5836]68   Aragog paused
[5837]5979   Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before, he said slowly
[5838]16398   Hagrid's in trouble, said Harry, breathing very fast
[5839]5879    That's why we've come
[5840]68   In trouble
[5841]11601   said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers
[5842]78    But why has he sent you
[5843]9890  Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn't think his legs would support him
[5844]209    So he spoke from the ground, as calmly as he could
[5845]6357   They think, up at the school, that Hagrid's been setting a - a - something on students
[5846]824    They've taken him to Azkaban
[5847]10065   Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause, except applause didn't usually make Harry feel sick with fear
[5848]5375   But that was years ago, said Aragog fretfully
[5849]413    Years and years ago
[5850]105    I remember it well
[5851]5097    That's why they made him leave the school
[5852]211    They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets
[5853]1503    They thought that Hagrid had opened the Chamber and set me free
[5854]3307   And you you didn't come from the Chamber of Secrets
[5855]11102   said Harry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead
[5856]0   I
[5857]5237   said Aragog, clicking angrily
[5858]145    I was not born in the castle
[5859]474    I come from a distant land
[5860]900    A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg
[5861]1196    Hagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table
[5862]1520    Hagrid is my good friend, and a good man
[5863]250    When I was discovered, and blamed for the death of a girl, he protected me
[5864]781    I have lived here in the forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me
[5865]5565    He even found me a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through Hagrid's goodnessHarry summoned what remained of his courage
[5866]58   So you never - never attacked anyone
[5867]226  Never, croaked the old spider
[5868]705    It would have been my instinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human
[5869]211    The body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom
[5870]497    I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up
[5871]2717    Our kind like the dark and the quietBut then Do you know what did kill that girl
[5872]10818   said Harry
[5873]6335    Because whatever it is, it's back and attacking people again-His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted all around him
[5874]5591   The thing that lives in the castle, said Aragog, is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others
[5875]1411    Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school
[5876]0   What is it
[5877]10841   said Harry urgently
[5878]217   More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in
[5879]76   We do not speak of it
[5880]5144   said Aragog fiercely
[5881]0    We do not name it
[5882]1441   I never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many times
[5883]8963   Harry didn't want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides
[5884]204    Aragog seemed to be tired of talking
[5885]8215    He was backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron
[5886]7392   We'll just go, then, Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind him
[5887]0   Go
[5888]5251   said Aragog slowly
[5889]1241    I think notBut - but-My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command
[5890]57    But I cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our midst
[5891]1067    Good-bye, friend of Hagrid
[5892]5740   Harry spun around
[5893]1707    Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wall of spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads
[5894]7939   Even as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good, there were too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow
[5895]372   Mr
[5896]5990    Weasley's car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring, its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto their backs, their endless legs waving in the air
[5897]8287    The car screeched to a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open
[5898]71   Get Fang
[5899]16318   Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of the car - the doors slammed shut - Ron didn't touch the accelerator but the car didn't need him; the engine roared and they were off, hitting more spiders
[5900]1221    They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and they were soon crashing through the forest, branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew
[5901]8459   Harry looked sideways at Ron
[5902]3371    His mouth was still open in the silent scream, but his eyes weren't popping anymore
[5903]22   Are you okay
[5904]2379  Ron stared straight ahead, unable to speak
[5905]7179   They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak
[5906]5985    After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky
[5907]496   The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield
[5908]288    They had reached the edge of the forest
[5909]12515    Fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid's house, tail between his legs
[5910]8949    Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring
[5911]6290    Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view
[5912]11497   Harry went back into Hagrid's cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak
[5913]122    Fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket
[5914]8642    When Harry got outside again, he found Ron being violent sick in the pumpkin patch
[5915]7423   Follow the spiders, said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve
[5916]1224    I'll never forgive Hagrid
[5917]67    We're lucky to be alive
[5918]13828   I bet he thought Aragog wouldn't hurt friends of his, said Harry
[5919]10283   That's exactly Hagrid's problem
[5920]7276   said Ron, thumping the wall of the cabin
[5921]8408    He always thinks monsters aren't as bad as they're made out, and look where it's got him
[5922]57   A cell in Azkaban
[5923]24   He was shivering uncontrollably now
[5924]105    What was the point of sending us in there
[5925]2126   What have we found out, I'd like to know
[5926]14304  That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets, said Harry, throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk
[5927]19    He was innocent
[5928]2327   Ron gave a loud snort
[5929]2667    Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard wasn't his idea of being innocent
[5930]6865   As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar
[5931]968    They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking
[5932]917    At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash
[5933]390    They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory
[5934]2336   Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed
[5935]8574    Harry, however, didn't feel very sleepy
[5936]5566    He sat on the edge of his fourposter, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said
[5937]4707   The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort -even other monsters didn't want to name it
[5938]2079    But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it was, or how it petrified its victims
[5939]857    Even Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets
[5940]6450   Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window
[5941]2437   He couldn't see what else they could do
[5942]202    They had hit dead ends everywhere
[5943]2538    Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time
[5944]110    There was nobody else to ask
[5945]11024    Harry lay down, still thinking about what Aragog had said
[5946]1083   He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright
[5947]18120   Ron, he hissed through the dark, Ron-Ron woke with a yelp like Fang's, stared wildly around, and saw Harry
[5948]2121   Ron - that girl who died
[5949]21152    Aragog said she was found in a bathroom, said Harry, ignoring Neville's snuffling snores from the corner
[5950]305    What if she never left the bathroom
[5951]4750   What if she's still there
[5952]2543  Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight
[5953]28    And then he understood, too
[5954]3584   You don't think - not Moaning Myrtle

[5974]728    Lionfish 11/Nov/2007     Chapter Seventeen     The Heir of SlytherinContents  Prev Chapter  Next Chapter  
[5975]870     He was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber
[5976]1322    Towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place
[5977]6230    His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence
[5978]149    Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar
[5979]336   And where was Ginny
[5980]722  He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns
[5981]275    Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls
[5982]893    He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement
[5983]345    The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him
[5984]791    More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir
[5985]706   Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall
[5986]13410   Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor
[5987]1007    And between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair
[5988]336   Ginny
[5989]5916   Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees
[5990]12361    Ginny - don't be dead - please don't be dead - He flung his wand aside, grabbed Ginny's shoulders, and turned her over
[5991]3781    Her face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn't Petrified
[5992]6001    But then she must beGinny, please wake up, Harry muttered desperately, shaking her
[5993]5583    Ginny's head lolled hopelessly from side to side
[5994]8132   She won't wake, said a soft voice
[5995]5827   Harry jumped and spun around on his knees
[5996]631   A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching
[5997]6527    He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at him through a misted window
[5998]1    But there was no mistaking him
[5999]181   Tom - Tom Riddle
[6000]11801  Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry's face
[6001]3328   What d'you mean, she won't wake
[6002]10851   Harry said desperately
[6003]9500    She's not - she's not -
[6004]10014  She's still alive, said Riddle
[6005]808    But only just
[6006]5854   Harry stared at him
[6007]1229    Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen
[6008]22   Are you a ghost
[6009]10835   Harry said uncertainly
[6010]5400   A memory, said Riddle quietly
[6011]285    Preserved in a diary for fifty years
[6012]5232   He pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes
[6013]11524    Lying open there was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom
[6014]6694    For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there - but there were more pressing matters to deal with
[6015]17976   You've got to help me, Tom, Harry said, raising Ginny's head again
[6016]1383    We've got to get her out of here
[6017]8895    There's a basilisk I don't know where it is, but it could be along any moment Please, help me
[6018]2843   Riddle didn't move
[6019]7058    Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny half off the floor, and bent to pick up his wand again
[6020]538   But his wand had gone
[6021]667   Did you see -
[6022]676  He looked up
[6023]11593    Riddle was still watching him - twirling Harry's wand between his long fingers
[6024]11232   Thanks, said Harry, stretching out his hand for it
[6025]5198   A smile curled the corners of Riddle's mouth
[6026]6256    He continued to stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly
[6027]16162   Listen, said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny's dead weight
[6028]1383    We've got to go
[6029]8290   If the basilisk comes-It won't come until it is called, said Riddle calmly
[6030]6511   Harry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any longer
[6031]852   What d'you mean
[6032]5086   he said
[6033]6035    Look, give me my wand, I might need it-Riddle's smile broadened
[6034]7534   You won't be needing it, he said
[6035]5854   Harry stared at him
[6036]3296   What d'you mean, I won't be -
[6037]13048  I've waited a long time for this, Harry Potter, said Riddle
[6038]55    For the chance to see you
[6039]76    To speak to you
[6040]14807   Look, said Harry, losing patience, I don't think you get it
[6041]163    We're in the Chamber of Secrets
[6042]17046    We can talk later-We're going to talk now, said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he pocketed Harry's wand
[6043]5854   Harry stared at him
[6044]2279    There was something very funny going on here How did Ginny get like this
[6045]482   he asked slowly
[6046]10061   Well, that's an interesting question, said Riddle pleasantly
[6047]604    And quite a long story
[6048]6987    I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley's like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger
[6049]144   What are you talking about
[6050]10818   said Harry
[6051]5297   The diary, said Riddle
[6052]76    `My diary
[6053]39986    Little Ginny's been writing in it for months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - how her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books, how - Riddle's eyes glinted - how she didn't think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like herAll the time he spoke, Riddle's eyes never left Harry's face
[6054]469    There was an almost hungry look in them
[6055]5874   It's very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven-year-old girl, he went on
[6056]3    But I was patient
[6057]23    I wrote back
[6058]91    I was sympathetic, I was kind
[6059]387    Ginny simply loved me
[6060]16360    No one's ever understood me like you, Tom I'm so glad I've got this diary to confide in It's like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn't suit him
[6061]10619    It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry's neck
[6062]7219   If I say it myself, Harry, I've always been able to charm the people I needed
[6063]900    So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets
[6064]1205    I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley
[6065]2107    Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into herWhat d'you mean
[6066]11148   said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry
[6067]8643   Haven't you guessed yet, Harry Potter
[6068]5267   said Riddle softly
[6069]1305    Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets
[6070]318    She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls
[6071]5114    She set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib's cat
[6072]5855   No, Harry whispered
[6073]5544   Yes, said Riddle, calmly
[6074]3878    Of course, she didn't know what she was doing at first
[6075]10    It was very amusing
[6076]12961    I wish you could have seen her new diary entries far more interesting, they became Dear Tom, he recited, watching Harry's horrified face, `I think I'm losing my memory
[6077]4578    There are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 don't know how they got there
[6078]4880    Dear Tom, l can't remember what I did on the night of Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I've got paint all down my front
[6079]1275    Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I'm pale and I'm not myself
[6080]4406    I think he suspects me There was another attack today and I don't know where I was
[6081]512    Tom, what am I going to do
[6082]2622   I think I'm going mad I think I'm the one attacking everyone, Tom
[6083]10611  Harry's fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his palms
[6084]7248   It took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her diary, said Riddle
[6085]204    But she finally became suspicious and tried to dispose of it
[6086]10704    And that's where you came in, Harry
[6087]2455    You found it, and I couldn't have been more delighted
[6088]1506    Of all the people who could have picked it up, it was you, the very person I was most anxious to meetAnd why did you want to meet me
[6089]10818   said Harry
[6090]609    Anger was coursing through him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady
[6091]11611   Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry, said Riddle
[6092]30    Your whole fascinating history
[6093]11198    His eyes roved over the lightning scar on Harry's forehead, and their expression grew hungrier
[6094]450    I knew I must find out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could
[6095]17912    So I decided to show you my famous capture of that great oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust-Hagrid's my friend, said Harry, his voice now shaking
[6096]2716    And you framed him, didn't you
[6097]768   I thought you made a mistake, but-Riddle laughed his high laugh again
[6098]11213   It was my word against Hagrid's, Harry
[6099]901    Well, you can imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet
[6100]2810    On the one hand, Tom Riddle, poor but brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student on the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in trouble every other week, trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls but I admit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked
[6101]3683    I thought someone must realize that Hagrid couldn't possibly be the Heir of Slytherin
[6102]1235    It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power
[6103]2151  Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think Hagrid was innocent
[6104]715    He persuaded Dippetto keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper
[6105]16576    Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did I bet Dumbledore saw right through you, said Harry, his teeth gritted
[6106]6250   Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid was expelled, said Riddle carelessly
[6107]3299    I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school
[6108]4140    But I wasn't going to waste those long years I'd spent searching for it
[6109]6085    I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work
[6110]13331   Well, you haven't finished it, said Harry triumphantly
[6111]5400    No one's died this time, not even the cat
[6112]11373    In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again-Haven't I already told you, said Riddle quietly, that killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore
[6113]191   For many months now, my new target has been - you
[6114]5854   Harry stared at him
[6115]1276   Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was opened, it was Ginny who was writing to me, not you
[6116]406    She saw you with the diary, you see, and panicked
[6117]220    What if you found out how to work it, and I repeated all her secrets to you
[6118]1004   What if, even worse, I told you who'd been strangling roosters
[6119]416   So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back
[6120]278    But I knew what I must do
[6121]4996    It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin's heir
[6122]1193    From everything Ginny had told me about you, I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery - particularly if one of your best friends was attacked
[6123]1998    And Ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak Parseltongue So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait
[6124]64    She struggled and cried and became very boring
[6125]2840    But there isn't much life left in her She put too much into the diary, into me
[6126]626    Enough to let me leave its pages at last I have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here
[6127]1335    I knew you'd come
[6128]6235    I have many questions for you, Harry Potter
[6129]734   Like what
[6130]5789   Harry spat, fists still clenched
[6131]6346   Well, said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, how is it that you - a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent - managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time
[6132]5882   How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed
[6133]644  There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now
[6134]103   Why do you care how I escaped
[6135]10944   said Harry slowly
[6136]23594    Voldemort was after your timeVoldemort, said Riddle softly, is my past, present, and future, Harry PotterHe pulled Harry's wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air, writing three shimmering words:TOM MARVOLO RIDDLEThen he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged themselves:I AM LORD VOLDEMORTYou see
[6137]123   he whispered
[6138]547    It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course
[6139]6122    You think I was going to use my filthy Muggle father's name forever
[6140]5108   I, in whose veins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother's side
[6141]1175   I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his wife was a witch
[6142]6609   No, Harry - I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world
[6143]10537  Harry's brain seemed to have jammed
[6144]11076    He stared numbly at Riddle, at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry's own parents, and so many others At last he forced himself to speak
[6145]5674   You're not, he said, his quiet voice full of hatred
[6146]0   Not what
[6147]186   snapped Riddle
[6148]11007   Not the greatest sorcerer in the world, said Harry, breathing fast
[6149]1157    Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore
[6150]86    Everyone says so
[6151]3078    Even when you were strong, you didn't dare try and take over at Hogwarts
[6152]7626    Dumbledore saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you now, wherever you're hiding these days-The smile had gone from Riddle's face, to be replaced by a very ugly look
[6153]5733   Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me
[6154]24   he hissed
[6155]5441   He's not as gone as you might think
[6156]5739   Harry retorted
[6157]278    He was speaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, wishing rather than believing it to be true
[6158]499   Riddle opened his mouth, but froze
[6159]112   Music was coming from somewhere
[6160]259    Riddle whirled around to stare down the empty Chamber
[6161]77    The music was growing louder
[6162]11012    It was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry's scalp and made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size
[6163]6507    Then, as the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar
[6164]262   A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling
[6165]5336    It had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacock's and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged bundle
[6166]6213   A second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry
[6167]767    It dropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on his shoulder
[6168]7894    As it folded its great wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a long, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye
[6169]176   The bird stopped singing
[6170]10861    It sat still and warm next to Harry's cheek, gazing steadily at Riddle
[6171]4823   That's a phoenix
[6172]5400    said Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it
[6173]43   Fawkes
[6174]11017   Harry breathed, and he felt the bird's golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently
[6175]10850   And that - said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had dropped, that's the old school Sorting Hat-So it was
[6176]10960    Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry's feet
[6177]309   Riddle began to laugh again
[6178]728    He laughed so hard that the dark chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at once
[6179]820   This is what Dumbledore sends his defender
[6180]293   A songbird and an old hat
[6181]6338   Do you feel brave, Harry Potter
[6182]157   Do you feel safe now
[6183]8513  Harry didn't answer
[6184]709    He might not see what use Fawkes or the Sorting Hat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited for Riddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting
[6185]11067   To business, Harry, said Riddle, still smiling broadly
[6186]260    Twice - in your past, in my future - we have met
[6187]122    And twice I failed to kill you
[6188]670    How did you survive
[6189]332   Tell me everything
[6190]492    The longer you talk, he added softly, the longer you stay alive
[6191]5905   Harry was thinking fast, weighing his chances
[6192]544    Riddle had the wand
[6193]6262    He, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would be much good in a duel
[6194]13415    It looked bad, all right but the longer Riddle stood there, the more life was dwindling out of Ginny and in the meantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle's outline was becoming clearer, more solid If it had to be a fight between him and Riddle, better sooner than later
[6195]11046   No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me, said Harry abruptly
[6196]3712    I don't know myself
[6197]3292    But I know why you couldn't kill me
[6198]184    Because my mother died to save me
[6199]541    My common Muggle-born mother, he added, shaking with suppressed rage
[6200]130    She stopped you killing me
[6201]1438    And I've seen the real you, I saw you last year
[6202]2    You're a wreck
[6203]107    You're barely alive
[6204]5483    That's where all your power got you
[6205]34    You're in hiding
[6206]5471    You're ugly, you're foul-Riddle's face contorted
[6207]151    Then he forced it into an awful smile
[6208]0    So
[6209]184    Your mother died to save you
[6210]5067    Yes, that's a powerful countercharm
[6211]23    I can see now there is nothing special about you, after all
[6212]41    I wondered, you see
[6213]30    There are strange likenesses between us, after all
[6214]73    Even you must have noticed
[6215]352    Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by Muggles
[6216]1763    Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself We even look something alike but after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me
[6217]5694    That's all I wanted to know
[6218]6542   Harry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand
[6219]5011    But Riddle's twisted smile was widening again
[6220]7052   Now, Harry, I'm going to teach you a little lesson
[6221]13643    Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against famous Harry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give himHe cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then walked away
[6222]7932    Harry, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched Riddle stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin, high above him in the half-darkness
[6223]6931    Riddle opened his mouth wide and hissed - but Harry understood what he was saying Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four
[6224]6395   Harry wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on his shoulder
[6225]5646   Slytherin's gigantic stone face was moving
[6226]6786    Horrorstruck, Harry saw his mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole
[6227]5159   And something was stirring inside the statue's mouth
[6228]8    Something was slithering up from its depths
[6229]7977   Harry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes'wing sweep his cheek as he took flight
[6230]8985    Harry wanted to shout, Don't leave me
[6231]837   but what chance did a phoenix have against the king of serpents
[6232]613  Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber
[6233]11518    Harry felt it shudder - he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin's mouth
[6234]5789    Then he heard Riddle's hissing voice:Kill him
[6235]6503   The basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor
[6236]7599    Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way - Voldemort was laughing
[6237]5741   Harry tripped
[6238]1150    He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming
[6239]6966   There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall
[6240]601    Waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing, something thrashing wildly off the pillars
[6241]3796   He couldn't help it - he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on
[6242]1456   The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk, had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between the pillars
[6243]7130    As Harry trembled, ready to close his eyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake
[6244]1062   Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers Fawkes dived
[6245]1292    His long golden beak sank out of sight and a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor
[6246]26372    The snake's tail thrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut his eyes, it turned - Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting in agony
[6247]0   NO
[6248]6156   Harry heard Riddle screaming
[6249]152    LEAVE THE BIRD
[6250]152   LEAVE THE BIRD
[6251]132   THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU
[6252]26    YOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM
[6253]84    KILL HIM
[6254]66  The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly
[6255]1272    Fawkes was circling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at its scaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes
[6256]11286   Help me, help me, Harry muttered wildly, someone - anyoneThe snake's tail whipped across the floor again
[6257]5755    Harry ducked
[6258]648    Something soft hit his face
[6259]10765   The basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry's arms
[6260]5796    Harry seized it
[6261]6026    It was all he had left, his only chance - he rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk's tail swung over him again
[6262]7042   Help me - help me - Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat
[6263]145    Please help me 
[6264]550   There was no answering voice
[6265]609    Instead, the hat contracted, as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly
[6266]11211   Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry's head, almost knocking him out
[6267]1520    Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it
[6268]626   A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs
[6269]216   KILL THE BOY
[6270]152   LEAVE THE BIRD
[6271]132   THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU
[6272]31    SNIFF - SMELL HIM
[6273]6056   Harry was on his feet, ready
[6274]5938    The basilisk's head was falling, its body coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him
[6275]7044    He could see the vast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough to swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin, glittering, venomous-It lunged blindly - Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall
[6276]10508    It lunged again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry's side
[6277]23642    He raised the sword in both his hands-The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true - Harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent's mouth-But as warm blood drenched Harry's arms, he felt a searing pain just above his elbow
[6278]1087    One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor
[6279]5925   Harry slid down the wall
[6280]298    He gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm
[6281]322    But he knew it was too late
[6282]366    White-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound
[6283]710    Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes, his vision went foggy
[6284]142    The Chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color
[6285]6266   A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him
[6286]10873   Fawkes, said Harry thickly
[6287]5764    You were fantastic, FawkesHe felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent's fang had pierced him
[6288]666   He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of him
[6289]16794   You're dead, Harry Potter, said Riddle's voice above him
[6290]91    Dead
[6291]5662    Even Dumbledore's bird knows it
[6292]5393    Do you see what he's doing, Potter
[6293]4775   He's crying
[6294]5746   Harry blinked
[6295]5303    Fawke's head slid in and out of focus
[6296]82    Thick, pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers
[6297]7268   I'm going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter
[6298]556    Take your time
[6299]477    I'm in no hurry
[6300]6019   Harry felt drowsy
[6301]19    Everything around him seemed to be spinning
[6302]16775   So ends the famous Harry Potter, said Riddle's distant voice
[6303]632    Alone in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged
[6304]19790    You'll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry She bought you twelve years of borrowed time but Lord Voldemort got you in the end, as you knew he mustIf this is dying, thought Harry, it's not so bad
[6305]156   Even the pain was leaving himBut was this dying
[6306]1008   Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to be coming back into focus
[6307]17881    Harry gave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes, still resting his head on Harry's arm
[6308]145    A pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound - except that there was no wound
[6309]10987   Get away, bird, said Riddle's voice suddenly
[6310]12118    Get away from him - I said, get away-Harry raised his head
[6311]12297    Riddle was pointing Harry's wand at Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet
[6312]16242   Phoenix tears said Riddle quietly, staring at Harry's arm
[6313]11923    Of course healing powers I forgotHe looked into Harry's face
[6314]40    But it makes no difference
[6315]446    In fact, I prefer it this way
[6316]18397    Just you and me, Harry Potter you and meHe raised the wand Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry's lap - the diary
[6317]6708   For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it
[6318]6579    Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book
[6319]406   There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream
[6320]11065    Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry's hands, flooding the floor
[6321]301    Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then-He had gone
[6322]11397    Harry's wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence
[6323]222    Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary
[6324]642    The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through it
[6325]6000   Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up
[6326]2002    His head was spinning as though he'd just traveled miles by Floo powder
[6327]5733    Slowly, he gathered together his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk's mouth
[6328]565   Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber
[6329]344    Ginny was stirring
[6330]5940    As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up
[6331]7085    Her bemused eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand
[6332]999    She drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face
[6333]32878   Harry - oh, Harry - I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn't say it in front of Percy - it was me, Harry - but I - I s-swear I d-didn't mean to - R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over - and - how did you kill that - that thing
[6334]4903   W-where's Riddle
[6335]22199   The last thing I r-remember is him coming out of the diary-It's all right, said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the fang hole, Riddle's finished
[6336]457    Look
[6337]23   Him and the basilisk
[6338]6438    C'mon, Ginny, let's get out of here-I'm going to be expelled
[6339]6341   Ginny wept as Harry helped her awkwardly to her feet
[6340]3762    I've looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever since B-Bill came and n-now I'll have to leave and - w-what'll Mum and Dad say
[6341]310  Fawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance
[6342]6369    Harry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel
[6343]6348    Harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss
[6344]11425   After a few minutes'progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached Harry's ears
[6345]2002   Ron
[6346]5820   Harry yelled, speeding up
[6347]5108    Ginny's okay
[6348]1383   I've got her
[6349]3641  He heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make in the rock fall
[6350]336   Ginny
[6351]2161   Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull her through first
[6352]43    You're alive
[6353]3042   I don't believe it
[6354]143   What happened
[6355]1133   How - what - where did that bird come from
[6356]407  Fawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny
[6357]21144   He's Dumbledore's, said Harry, squeezing through himself
[6358]1837   How come you've got a sword
[6359]17993   said Ron, gaping at the glittering weapon in Harry's hand
[6360]11886   I'll explain when we get out of here, said Harry with a sideways glance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever
[6361]10974   But-Later, Harry said shortly
[6362]7128    He didn't think it was a good idea to tell Ron yet who'd been opening the Chamber, not in front of Ginny, anyway
[6363]4954    Where's Lockhart
[6364]8222  Back there, said Ron, still looking puzzled but jerking his head up the tunnel toward the pipe
[6365]5197    He's in a bad way
[6366]436    Come and see
[6367]1082   Led by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe
[6368]377    Gilderoy Lockhart was sitting there, humming placidly to himself
[6369]12009   His memory's gone, said Ron
[6370]97    The Memory Charm backfired
[6371]166    Hit him instead of us
[6372]3072    Hasn't got a clue who he is, or where he is, or who we are
[6373]835    I told him to come and wait here
[6374]4779    He's a danger to himself
[6375]566   Lockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all
[6376]5122   Hello, he said
[6377]2719    Odd sort of place, this, isn't it
[6378]32   Do you live here
[6379]12896  No, said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry
[6380]7123   Harry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe
[6381]877   Have you thought how we're going to get back up this
[6382]7088   he said to Ron
[6383]9431   Ron shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harry and was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright in the dark
[6384]488    He was waving his long golden tail feathers
[6385]6425    Harry looked uncertainly at him
[6386]8623   He looks like he wants you to grab hold said Ron, looking perplexed
[6387]13414    But you're much too heavy for a bird to pull up there-Fawkes, said Harry, isn't an ordinary bird
[6388]487    He turned quickly to the others
[6389]1434    We've got to hold on to each other
[6390]7455    Ginny, grab Ron's hand
[6391]8347    Professor Lockhart-He means you, said Ron sharply to Lockhart
[6392]35309   You hold Ginny's other hand-Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron took hold of the back of Harry's robes, and Harry reached out and took hold of Fawkes's strangely hot tail feathers
[6393]404   An extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole body and the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upward through the pipe
[6394]6252    Harry could hear Lockhart dangling below him, saying, Amazing
[6395]8   Amazing
[6396]1754   This is just like magic
[6397]17311   The chill air was whipping through Harry's hair, and before he'd stopped enjoying the ride, it was over - all four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened his hat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place
[6398]63   Myrtle goggled at them
[6399]10883   You're alive, she said blankly to Harry
[6400]10357   There's no need to sound so disappointed, he said grimly, wiping flecks of blood and slime off his glasses
[6401]7859   Oh, well I'd just been thinking if you had died, you'd have been welcome to share my toilet, said Myrtle, blushing silver
[6402]4   Urgh
[6403]7980   said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, deserted corridor outside
[6404]5732    Harry
[6405]5392   I think Myrtle's grown fond of you
[6406]1723   You've got competition, Ginny
[6407]5670  But tears were still flooding silently down Ginny's face
[6408]0   Where now
[6409]7915   said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny
[6410]5815    Harry pointed
[6411]620   Fawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor
[6412]6253    They strode after him, and moments later, found themselves outside Professor McGonagall's office
[6413]6563   Harry knocked and pushed the door open

[6429]19519     For a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart stood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in Harry's case) blood
[6430]26    Then there was a scream
[6431]336   Ginny
[6432]369  It was Mrs
[6433]786    Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the fire
[6434]841    She leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr
[6435]672    Weasley, and both of them flung themselves on their daughter
[6436]6491   Harry, however, was looking past them
[6437]3259    Professor Dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor McGonagall, who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest
[6438]25601    Fawkes went whooshing past Harry's ear and settled on Dumbledore's shoulder, just as Harry found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs
[6439]5417    Weasley's tight embrace
[6440]26   You saved her
[6441]26   You saved her
[6442]667   How did you do it
[6443]8802  I think we'd all like to know that, said Professor McGonagall weakly
[6444]369   Mrs
[6445]12449    Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a moment, then walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the ruby-encrusted sword, and what remained of Riddle's diary
[6446]210   Then he started telling them everything
[6447]9109    For nearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing the disembodied voice, how Hermione had finally realized that he was hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed the spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets might be in her bathroomVery well, Professor McGonagall prompted him as he paused, so you found out where the entrance was -breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way, I might add - but how on earth did you all get out of there alive, Potter
[6448]11818  So Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told them about Fawkes's timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving him the sword
[6449]4    But then he faltered
[6450]5451    He had so far avoided mentioning Riddle's diary - or Ginny
[6451]1008    She was standing with her head against Mrs
[6452]5570    Weasley's shoulder, and tears were still coursing silently down her cheeks
[6453]43    What if they expelled her
[6454]6140   Harry thought in panic
[6455]8415    Riddle's diary didn't work anymore How could they prove it had been he who'd made her do it all
[6456]7526  Instinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly, the firelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles
[6457]7038   What interests me most, said Dumbledore gently, is how Lord Voldemort managed to enchant Ginny, when my sources tell me he is currently in hiding in the forests of Albania
[6458]5896   Relief - warm, sweeping, glorious relief - swept over Harry
[6459]4768    W-what's that
[6460]5458   said Mr
[6461]1195    Weasley in a stunned voice
[6462]771    You-Know-Who
[6463]344   En-enchant Ginny
[6464]7785   But Ginny's not Ginny hasn't been has she
[6465]11919  It was this diary, said Harry quickly, picking it up and showing it to Dumbledore
[6466]6701    Riddle wrote it when he was sixteenDumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down his long, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages
[6467]5158   Brilliant, he said softly
[6468]761    Of course, he was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen
[6469]1001    He turned around to the Weasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered
[6470]1680   Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle
[6471]542    I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts
[6472]1659    He disappeared after leaving the school traveled far and wide sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable
[6473]1158    Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever, handsome boy who was once Head Boy here
[6474]5791   But, Ginny, said Mrs
[6475]636    Weasley
[6476]5776    What's our Ginny got to do with - with - him
[6477]1043  His d-diary Ginny sobbed
[6478]6087    I've b-been writing in it, and he's been w-writing back all year-Ginny
[6479]5458   said Mr
[6480]637    Weasley, flabbergasted
[6481]2454    Haven't I taught you anything
[6482]322    What have I always told you
[6483]2947   Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain
[6484]2870   Why didn't you show the diary to me, or your mother
[6485]1351   A suspicious object like that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic
[6486]4446  I d-didn't know, sobbed Ginny
[6487]1047    I found it inside one of the books Mum got me
[6488]4616    I th-thought someone had just left it in there and forgotten about it-Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away, Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice
[6489]40    This has been a terrible ordeal for her
[6490]11    There will be no punishment
[6491]440    Older and wiser wizards than she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort
[6492]714    He strode over to the door and opened it
[6493]575    Bed rest and perhaps a large, steaming mug of hot chocolate
[6494]129    I always find that cheers me up, he added, twinkling kindly down at her
[6495]164    You will find that Madam Pomfrey is still awake
[6496]10711    She's just giving out Mandrake juice - I daresay the basilisk's victims will be waking up any moment
[6497]6387   So Hermione's okay
[6498]7127   said Ron brightly
[6499]6253   There has been no lasting harm done, Ginny, said Dumbledore
[6500]369   Mrs
[6501]1392    Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr
[6502]1397    Weasley followed, still looking deeply shaken
[6503]9400   You know, Minerva, Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully to Professor McGonagall, I think all this merits a good feast
[6504]118    Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens
[6505]7245  Right, said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door
[6506]1827    I'll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I
[6507]5938  Certainly, said Dumbledore
[6508]8869   She left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore
[6509]1194    What exactly had Professor McGonagall meant, deal with them
[6510]2422   Surely - surely - they weren't about to be punished
[6511]6399  I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules, said Dumbledore
[6512]2380   Ron opened his mouth in horror
[6513]1315   Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words, Dumbledore went on, smiling
[6514]1685    You will both receive Special Awards for Services to the School and - let me see - yes, I think two hundred points apiece for Gryffindor
[6515]7539   Ron went as brightly pink as Lockhart's valentine flowers and closed his mouth again
[6516]1043   But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this dangerous adventure, Dumbledore added
[6517]46    Why so modest, Gilderoy
[6518]6035  Harry gave a start
[6519]305    He had completely forgotten about Lockhart
[6520]1733    He turned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room, still wearing his vague smile
[6521]1968    When Dumbledore addressed him, Lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to
[6522]8987   Professor Dumbledore, Ron said quickly, there was an accident down in the Chamber of Secrets
[6523]1706    Professor Lockhart-Am I a professor
[6524]5336   said Lockhart in mild surprise
[6525]8    Goodness
[6526]58    I expect I was hopeless, was I
[6527]3611  He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired, Ron explained quietly to Dumbledore
[6528]7042   Dear me, said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silver mustache quivering
[6529]61    Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy
[6530]18  Sword
[6531]5305   said Lockhart dimly
[6532]3146    Haven't got a sword
[6533]132    That boy has, though
[6534]5815    He pointed at Harry
[6535]571    He'll lend you one
[6536]1236   Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infirmary, too
[6537]7905   Dumbledore said to Ron
[6538]1469    I'd like a few more words with HarryLockhart ambled out
[6539]9652    Ron cast a curious look back at Dumbledore and Harry as he closed the door
[6540]878   Dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire
[6541]16926   Sit down, Harry, he said, and Harry sat, feeling unaccountably nervous
[6542]12496   First of all, Harry, I want to thank you, said Dumbledore, eyes twinkling again
[6543]173    You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber
[6544]162    Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you
[6545]93   He stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee
[6546]6662    Harry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him
[6547]6138   And so you met Tom Riddle, said Dumbledore thoughtfully
[6548]6193    I imagine he was most interested in youSuddenly, something that was nagging at Harry came tumbling out of his mouth
[6549]7964   Professor Dumbledore Riddle said I'm like him
[6550]31    Strange likenesses, he saidDid he, now
[6551]12390   said Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully at Harry from under his thick silver eyebrows
[6552]6294    And what do you think, Harry
[6553]4678  I don't think I'm like him
[6554]11587   said Harry, more loudly than he'd intended
[6555]1699    I mean, I'm - I'm in Gryffindor, I'mBut he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind
[6556]1133   Professor, he started again after a moment
[6557]1853    The Sorting Hat told me I'd - I'd have done well in Slytherin
[6558]17735    Everyone thought I was Slytherin's heir for a while because I can speak Parseltongue You can speak Parseltongue, Harry, said Dumbledore calmly, because Lord Voldemort - who is the last remaining ancestor of Salazar Slytherin - can speak Parseltongue
[6559]1016    Unless I'm much mistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar
[6560]648    Not something he intended to do, I'm sureVoldemort put a bit of himself in me
[6561]10823   Harry said, thunderstruck
[6562]35   It certainly seems so
[6563]17695   So I should be in Slytherin, Harry said, looking desperately into Dumbledore's face
[6564]11209    The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin's power in me, and it-Put you in Gryffindor, said Dumbledore calmly
[6565]5807    Listen to me, Harry
[6566]741    You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-picked students
[6567]192    His own very rare gift, Parseltongue - resourcefulness - determination - a certain disregard for rules, he added, his mustache quivering again
[6568]365    Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor
[6569]771    You know why that was
[6570]562    Think
[6571]18108   It only put me in Gryffindor, said Harry in a defeated voice, because I asked not to go in Slytherin`Exactly, said Dumbledore, beaming once more
[6572]228    Which makes you very different from Tom Riddle
[6573]5887    It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities
[6574]6009    Harry sat motionless in his chair, stunned
[6575]6812    If you want proof, Harry, that you belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this
[6576]12848   Dumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall's desk, picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and handed it to Harry
[6577]6105    Dully, Harry turned it over, the rubies blazing in the firelight
[6578]1139    And then he saw the name engraved just below the hilt
[6579]12203   Godric GryffindorOnly a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry, said Dumbledore simply
[6580]103   For a minute, neither of them spoke
[6581]7484    Then Dumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in Professor McGonagall's desk and took out a quill and a bottle of ink
[6582]5988   What you need, Harry, is some food and sleep
[6583]318    I suggest you go down to the feast, while I write to Azkaban -we need our gamekeeper back
[6584]228    And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, too, he added Thoughtfully
[6585]4269    We'll be needing a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Dear me, we do seem to run through them, don't we
[6586]6955  Harry got up and crossed to the door
[6587]1927    He had just reached for the handle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall
[6588]1193   Lucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his face
[6589]373    And cowering behind his legs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was Dobby
[6590]6395   Good evening, Lucius, said Dumbledore pleasantly
[6591]372   Mr
[6592]6702    Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept into the room
[6593]1538    Dobby went scurrying in after him, crouching at the hem of his cloak, a look of abject terror on his face
[6594]598   The elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting to finish cleaning Mr
[6595]22    Malfoys shoes
[6596]431    Apparently Mr
[6597]1280    Malfoy had set out in a great hurry, for not only were his shoes half-polished, but his usually sleek hair was disheveled
[6598]1574    Ignoring the elf bobbing apologetically around his ankles, he fixed his cold eyes upon Dumbledore
[6599]0   So
[6600]6215   he said You've come back
[6601]673    The governors suspended you, but you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts
[6602]6109   Well, you see, Lucius, said Dumbledore, smiling serenely, the other eleven governors contacted me today
[6603]1269    It was something like being caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth
[6604]1214    They'd heard that Arthur Weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once
[6605]820    They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after all
[6606]3868    Very strange tales they told me, too Several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn't agree to suspend me in the first place
[6607]372   Mr
[6608]1245    Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still slits of fury
[6609]140   So - have you stopped the attacks yet
[6610]13   he sneered
[6611]106    Have you caught the culprit
[6612]6002  We have, said Dumbledore, with a smile
[6613]0   Well
[6614]5458   said Mr
[6615]495    Malfoy sharply
[6616]0    Who is it
[6617]6592  The same person as last time, Lucius, said Dumbledore
[6618]944    But this time, Lord Voldemort was acting through somebody else
[6619]121    By means of this diary
[6620]1287   He held up the small black book with the large hole through the center, watching Mr
[6621]496    Malfoy closely
[6622]6085    Harry, however, was watching Dobby
[6623]337   The elf was doing something very odd
[6624]7156    His great eyes fixed meaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the diary, then at Mr
[6625]1142    Malfoy, and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist
[6626]5458   I see said Mr
[6627]1383    Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore
[6628]7072   A clever plan, said Dumbledore in a level voice, still staring Mr
[6629]688    Malfoy straight in the eye
[6630]6104    Because if Harry here - Mr
[6631]12333    Malfoy shot Harry a swift, sharp look and his friend Ron hadn't discovered this book, why -- Ginny Weasley might have taken all the blame
[6632]2610    No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn't acted of her own free willMr
[6633]5526    Malfoy said nothing
[6634]625    His face was suddenly masklike
[6635]1360   And imagine, Dumbledore went on, what might have happened then The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-blood families
[6636]6031    Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and - killing Muggle-borns Very fortunate the diary was discovered, and Riddle's memories wiped from it
[6637]68    Who knows what the consequences might have been otherwiseMr
[6638]553    Malfoy forced himself to speak
[6639]5098   Very fortunate, he said stiffly
[6640]1373   And still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first to the diary, then to Lucius Malfoy, then punching himself in the head
[6641]5863   And Harry suddenly understood
[6642]714    He nodded at Dobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment
[6643]5572   Don't you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr
[6644]440    Malfoy
[6645]10818   said Harry
[6646]507   Lucius Malfoy rounded on him
[6647]1934   How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it
[6648]5086   he said
[6649]11046   Because you gave it to her, said Harry
[6650]9    In Flourish and Blotts
[6651]3341    You picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary inside it, didn't you
[6652]698  He saw Mr
[6653]5451    Malfoy's white hands clench and unclench
[6654]36   Prove it, he hissed
[6655]12189   Oh, no one will be able to do that, said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry
[6656]267    Not now that Riddle has vanished from the book
[6657]6105    On the other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord Voldemort's old school things
[6658]10541    If any more of them find their way into innocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley, for one, will make sure they are traced back to youLucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry distinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand
[6659]712    Instead, he turned to his house-elf
[6660]700    We're going, Dobby
[6661]1695  He wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him, he kicked him right through it
[6662]950    They could hear Dobby squealing with pain all the way along the corridor
[6663]6413    Harry stood for a moment, thinking hard
[6664]6884    Then it came to him-Professor Dumbledore, he said hurriedly
[6665]448    Can I give that diary back to Mr
[6666]440    Malfoy, please
[6667]11701  Certainly, Harry, said Dumbledore calmly
[6668]36    But hurry
[6669]6165    The feast, remember Harry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office
[6670]5319    He could hear Dobby's squeals of pain receding around the corner
[6671]6608    Quickly, wondering if this plan could possibly work, Harry took off one of his shoes, pulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into it
[6672]493    Then he ran down the dark corridor
[6673]172   He caught up with them at the top of the stairs
[6674]372   Mr
[6675]7542    Malfoy, he gasped, skidding to a halt, I've got something for you-And he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy's hand
[6676]0   What the -
[6677]372  Mr
[6678]7192    Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then looked furiously from the ruined book to Harry
[6679]12302   "You'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days, Harry Potter, he said softly
[6680]6    They were meddlesome fools, too
[6681]332   He turned to go
[6682]647   Come, Dobby
[6683]5522    I said, come
[6684]2919   But Dobby didn't move
[6685]11209    He was holding up Harry's disgusting, slimy sock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure
[6686]5314   Master has given a sock, said the elf in wonderment
[6687]481    Master gave it to Dobby
[6688]4750   What's that
[6689]383   spat Mr
[6690]440    Malfoy
[6691]937    What did you say
[6692]6003  Got a sock, said Dobby in disbelief
[6693]900    Master threw it, and Dobby caught it, and Dobby - Dobby is free
[6694]6676   Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf Then he lunged at Harry
[6695]892   You've lost me my servant, boy
[6696]6549  But Dobby shouted, You shall not harm Harry Potter
[6697]486  There was a loud bang, and Mr
[6698]490    Malfoy was thrown backward
[6699]711    He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below
[6700]2527    He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger
[6701]5575   You shall go now, he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr
[6702]440    Malfoy
[6703]6225    You shall not touch Harry Potter
[6704]0    You shall go now
[6705]517   Lucius Malfoy had no choice
[6706]378    With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight
[6707]6407   Harry Potter freed Dobby
[6708]12423   said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry, moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes
[6709]6598    Harry Potter set Dobby free
[6710]11072  Least I could do, Dobby, said Harry, grinning
[6711]1035    Just promise never to try and save my life again
[6712]5735   The elf's ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile
[6713]24417   I've just got one question, Dobby, said Harry as Dobby pulled on Harry's sock with shaking hands
[6714]450    You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember
[6715]5962   Well-It was a clue, sir, said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this was obvious
[6716]89    Was giving you a clue
[6717]452    The Dark Lord, before he changed his name, could be freely named, you see
[6718]11397  Right, said Harry weakly
[6719]804    Well, I'd better go
[6720]17177    There's a feast, and my friend Hermione should be awake by nowDobby threw his arms around Harry's middle and hugged him
[6721]6826   Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew
[6722]10   he sobbed
[6723]6197    Farewell, Harry Potter
[6724]396  And with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared
[6725]6896   Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like this
[6726]249    Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all night
[6727]11193    Harry didn't know whether the best bit was Hermione running toward him, screaming You solved it
[6728]2   You solved it
[6729]317   or Justin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring
[6730]19194    his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting him, or Hagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and Ron's four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year running, or Professor McGonagall standing up to tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat ("Oh, no
[6731]9266   said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back
[6732]355    Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news
[6733]7120   Shame, said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut
[6734]48    He has starting to grow on me
[6735]307   The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine
[6736]6276    Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences - Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled ("but we've had plenty of practice at that anyway, Ron told a disgruntled Hermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school governor
[6737]537    Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned the place
[6738]697    On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky
[6739]1417    On the other hand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again
[6740]985   Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express
[6741]11194    Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to themselves
[6742]345    They made the mos of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays
[6743]5967    They played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of Fred and George's Filibuster fireworks, and practiced disarming each other by magic
[6744]6188    Harry was getting very good at it
[6745]10577   They were almost at King's Cross when Harry remembered something
[6746]4684   Ginny - what did you see Percy doing, that he didn't want you to tell anyone
[6747]5796  Oh, that, said Ginny, giggling
[6748]5572    Well - Percy's got a girlfriend
[6749]6210    Fred dropped a stack of books on George's head
[6750]0   What
[6751]10272  It's that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater, said Ginny
[6752]4862    That's who he was writing to all last summer
[6753]5080    He's been meeting her all over the school in secret
[6754]375    I walked in on them kissing in an empty classroom one day
[6755]848    He was so upset when she was - you know - attacked
[6756]2446    You won't tease him, will you
[6757]129   she added anxiously
[6758]9821   Wouldn't dream of it, said Fred, who was looking like his birthday had come early
[6759]5497   Definitely not, said George, sniggering
[6760]436   The Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped
[6761]10231   Harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron and Hermione
[6762]2726   This is called a telephone number, he told Ron, scribbling it twice, tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them
[6763]1955    I told your dad how to use a telephone last summer - he'll know
[6764]94    Call me at the Dursleys', okay
[6765]5423   I can't stand another two months with only Dudley to talk toYour aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won't they
[6766]7593   said Hermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted barrier
[6767]1034    When they hear what you did this year
[6768]13  Proud
[6769]10818   said Harry
[6770]5    Are you crazy
[6771]3537   All those times I could've died, and I didn't manage it
[6772]882   They'll be furiousAnd together they walked back through the gateway to the Muggle world

[6787]621    Lionfish 11/Nov/2007     Chapter One     Dudley DementedContents   Next Chapter  
[6788]992     The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive
[6789]567    Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing-for the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought
[6790]643    Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze
[6791]801    The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flowerbed outside number four
[6792]1777   He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time
[6793]2732    His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers
[6794]13049    Harry Potter's appearance did not endear him to the neighbours, who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passers-by
[6795]2482    In fact, the only way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia stuck their heads out of the living-room window and looked straight down into the flowerbed below
[6796]6266   On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here
[6797]3023    He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard earth but, on the other hand, nobody was glaring at him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room to watch television with his aunt and uncle
[6798]11774   Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle, suddenly spoke
[6799]5264   'Glad to see the boy's stopped trying to butt in
[6800]0    Where is he, anyway
[6801]9009  ''I don't know,' said Aunt Petunia, unconcerned
[6802]212    'Not in the house
[6803]331   'Uncle Vernon grunted
[6804]196   'Watching the news
[6805]0   
[6806]0   
[6807]5091   ' he said scathingly
[6808]7164    'I'd like to know what he's really up to
[6809]13602    As if a normal boy cares what's on the news- Dudley hasn't got a clue what's going on; doubt he knows who the Prime Minister is
[6810]5673   Anyway, it's not as if there'd be anything about his lot on our news-''Vernon, shh
[6811]5291  ' said Aunt Petunia
[6812]5156    'The window's open
[6813]839  ''Oh-yes- sorry, dear
[6814]272   'The Dursleys fell silent
[6815]6277    Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit 'n' Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs
[6816]652    Figg, a batty cat-loving old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past
[6817]82    She was frowning and muttering to herself
[6818]6179    Harry was very pleased he was concealed behind the bush, as Mrs
[6819]432    Figg had recently taken to asking him round for tea whenever she met him in the street
[6820]5981    She had rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon's voice floated out of the window again
[6821]39   'Dudders out for tea
[6822]5299  ''At the Polkisses',' said Aunt Petunia fondly
[6823]10548    'He's got so many little friends, he's so popular
[6824]0   
[6825]0   
[6826]5764   'Harry suppressed a snort with difficulty
[6827]630    The Dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley
[6828]559    They had swallowed all his dim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang every night of the summer holidays
[6829]6573    Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening vandalising the play park, smoking on street corners and throwing stones at passing cars and children
[6830]6757    Harry had seen them at it during his evening walks around Little Whinging; he had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers from bins along the way
[6831]11411   The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o'clock news reached Harry's ears and his stomach turned over
[6832]355    Perhaps tonight-after a month of waiting-would be the night
[6833]16408   'Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the Spanish baggage-handlers' strike reaches its second week-''Give 'em a lifelong siesta, I would,' snarled Uncle Vernon over the end of the newsreader's sentence, but no matter: outside in the flowerbed, Harry's stomach seemed to unclench
[6834]454    If anything had happened, it would surely have been the first item on the news; death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers
[6835]1030   He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky
[6836]276    Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again 
[6837]0   
[6838]0   
[6839]791    and always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why nothing had happened yet
[6840]0   
[6841]0   
[6842]0   
[6843]1617   He kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not recognised for what it really was by the Muggles-an unexplained disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident 
[6844]0   
[6845]0   
[6846]5569    but the baggage-handlers' strike was followed by news about the drought in the Southeast ('I hope he's listening next door
[6847]345  ' bellowed Uncle Vernon
[6848]102    'Him with his sprinklers on at three in the morning
[6849]5552  '), then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress's divorce from her famous husband ('As if we're interested in their sordid affairs,' sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on)
[6850]12101   Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said, '-and finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer
[6851]102    Bungy, who lives at the Five Feathers in Barnsley, has learned to water ski
[6852]200   Mary Dorkins went to find out more
[6853]6382   'Harry opened his eyes
[6854]273    If they had reached water-skiing budgerigars, there would be nothing else worth hearing
[6855]377    He rolled cautiously on to his front and raised himself on to his knees and elbows, preparing to crawl out from under the window
[6856]429   He had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick succession
[6857]10514   A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys' living room, and as though this was the signal Harry had been waiting for he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword-but before he could draw himself up to full height, the top of his head collided with the Dursleys' open window
[6858]289    The resultant crash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder
[6859]6529   Harry felt as though his head had been split in two
[6860]2133    Eyes streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street to spot the source of the noise, but he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat
[6861]344   'Put-it-away
[6862]10891  ' Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry's ear
[6863]0    'Now
[6864]4   Before-anyone-sees
[6865]0  ''Get-off-me
[6866]5772  ' Harry gasped
[6867]30843    For a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle's sausage-like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand; then, as the pain in the top of Harry's head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an electric shock
[6868]236    Some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew, making him impossible to hold
[6869]6118   Panting, Harry fell forwards over the hydrangea bush, straightened up and stared around
[6870]431    There was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows
[6871]6818    Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocent
[6872]97   'Lovely evening
[6873]844  ' shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs
[6874]218    Number Seven opposite, who was glaring from behind her net curtains
[6875]1780    'Did you hear that car backfire just now
[6876]586   Gave Petunia and me quite a turn
[6877]6459  'He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious neighbours had disappeared from their various windows, then the grin became a grimace of rage as he beckoned Harry back towards him
[6878]12466   Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon's outstretched hands could resume their strangling
[6879]371   'What the devil do you mean by it, boy
[6880]1240  ' asked Uncle Vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury
[6881]231   'What do I mean by what
[6882]10850  ' said Harry coldly
[6883]1770    He kept looking left and right up the street, still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise
[6884]15418   'Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our-''I didn't make that noise,' said Harry firmly
[6885]10744   Aunt Petunia's thin, horsy face now appeared beside Uncle Vernon's wide, purple one
[6886]686    She looked livid
[6887]174   'Why were you lurking under our window
[6888]1112  ''Yes-yes, good point, Petunia
[6889]475   What were you doing under our window, boy
[6890]11479  ''Listening to the news,' said Harry in a resigned voice
[6891]384   His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage
[6892]114   'Listening to the news
[6893]0   Again
[6894]10985  ''Well, it changes every day, you see,' said Harry
[6895]3093   Don't you be clever with me, boy
[6896]4450   I want to know what you're really up to-and don't give me any more of this listening to the news tosh
[6897]1077   You know perfectly well that your lot-'Careful, Vernon
[6898]10179  ' breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon lowered his voice so that Harry could barely hear him,'-that your lot don't get on our news
[6899]16339  'That's all you know,' said Harry
[6900]5771   The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia said, You're a nasty little liar
[6901]6848    What are all those-' she, too, lowered her voice so that Harry had to lip-read the next word, -owls doing if they're not bringing you news
[6902]5  'Aha
[6903]5445  ' said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper
[6904]132    Get out of that one, boy
[6905]3544   As if we didn't know you get all your news from those pestilential birds
[6906]6023  'Harry hesitated for a moment
[6907]2366    It cost him something to tell the truth this time, even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly know how bad he felt at admitting it
[6908]63   The owls 
[6909]0   
[6910]0   
[6911]7521    aren't bringing me news,' he said tonelessly
[6912]8333   I don't believe it,' said Aunt Petunia at once
[6913]5411   No more do I,' said Uncle Vernon forcefully
[6914]6115   We know you're up to something funny,' said Aunt Petunia
[6915]6239   We're not stupid, you know,' said Uncle Vernon
[6916]16201   Well, that's news to me,' said Harry, his temper rising, and before the Dursleys could call him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall and was striding off up the street
[6917]346   He was in trouble now and he knew it
[6918]2934    He would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness, but he did not care very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing matters on his mind
[6919]6039   Harry was sure the cracking noise had been made by someone Apparating or Disapparating
[6920]939    It was exactly the sound Dobby the house-elf made when he vanished into thin air
[6921]312    Was it possible that Dobby was here in Privet Drive
[6922]1074   Could Dobby be following him right at this very moment
[6923]8428   As this thought occurred he wheeled around and stared back down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely deserted and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to become invisible
[6924]684   He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was taking, for he had pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his favourite haunts automatically
[6925]243    Every few steps he glanced back over his shoulder
[6926]5430    Someone magical had been near him as he lay among Aunt Petunia's dying begonias, he was sure of it
[6927]4892    Why hadn't they spoken to him, why hadn't they made contact, why were they hiding now
[6928]526  And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his certainty leaked away
[6929]2613   Perhaps it hadn't been a magical sound after all
[6930]295    Perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises
[6931]7927    Could he be sure it hadn't been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbour's house
[6932]6682  Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach and before he knew it the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once again
[6933]667   Tomorrow morning he would be woken by the alarm at five o'clock so he could pay the owl that delivered the Daily Prophet-but was there any point continuing to take it
[6934]12384   Harry merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days; when the idiots who ran the paper finally realised that Voldemort was back it would be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry cared about
[6935]5071   If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his best friends Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he'd had that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed
[6936]3394   We can't say much about you-know-what, obviously

[6951]0   
[6952]489   'But when were they going to see him
[6953]40   Nobody seemed too bothered with a precise date
[6954]2922    Hermione had scribbled I expect we'll be seeing you quite soon inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon
[6955]17080   As far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione and Ron were in the same place, presumably at Ron's parents' house
[6956]924    He could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at The Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive
[6957]1240    In fact, he was so angry with them he had thrown away, unopened, the two boxes of Honeydukes chocolates they'd sent him for his birthday
[6958]1212    He'd regretted it later, after the wilted salad Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner that night
[6959]3653   And what were Ron and Hermione busy with
[6960]8217   Why wasn't he, Harry, busy
[6961]2423   Hadn't he proved himself capable of handling much more than them
[6962]41   Had they all forgotten what he had done
[6963]2805   Hadn't it been he who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being murdered, and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed
[6964]10191  Don't think about that, Harry told himself sternly for the hundredth time that summer
[6965]255    It was bad enough that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking moments too
[6966]1179   He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had first clapped eyes on his godfather
[6967]6635    Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how Harry was feeling
[6968]10250    Admittedly, his letters were just as empty of proper news as Ron and Hermione's, but at least they contained words of caution and consolation instead of tantalising hints: I know this must be frustrating for you
[6969]0   
[6970]0   
[6971]0   
[6972]220   ' Keep your nose clean and everything will be OK

[6976]2975   ' Be careful and don't do anything rash
[6977]0   
[6978]0   
[6979]0   
[6980]7478   'Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road and headed towards the darkening play park, he had (by and large) done as Sirius advised
[6981]256    He had at least resisted the temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for The Burrow by himself
[6982]8128    In fact, Harry thought his behaviour had been very good considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet Drive so long, reduced to hiding in flowerbeds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing
[6983]1475    Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped, attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the first place, then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriff
[6984]0   
[6985]0   
[6986]0   
[6987]5941   Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the parched grass
[6988]36    The park was as empty as the surrounding streets
[6989]850    When he reached the swings he sank on to the only one that Dudley and his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around the chain and stared moodily at the ground
[6990]219    He would not be able to hide in the Dursleys' flowerbed again
[6991]1101    Tomorrow, he would have to think of some fresh way of listening to the news
[6992]2078    In the meantime, he had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night, because even when he escaped the nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and locked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling he had when he was awake
[6993]5299    Often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting any more
[6994]998    In the past, his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was getting stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back they would probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be expected 
[6995]0   
[6996]0   
[6997]45    nothing to worry about 
[6998]0   
[6999]0   
[7000]243    old news
[7001]0   
[7002]0   
[7003]410   The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell with fury
[7004]2683    If it hadn't been for him, nobody would even have known Voldemort was back
[7005]0   And
[7006]1039    his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so hat he could hear about water-skiing budgerigars
[7007]877   How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily
[7008]4313   Why had Ron and Hermione got together without inviting him along, too
[7009]2052   How much longer was he supposed to endure Sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort had returned
[7010]11908   These curious thoughts whirled around in Harry's head, and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell around him, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass, and the only sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park railings
[7011]2774    He did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up
[7012]923    The streetlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the park
[7013]130    One of them was singing a loud, crude song
[7014]56    The others were laughing
[7015]346    A soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing bikes that they were wheeling along
[7016]6322   Harry knew who those people were
[7017]688    The figure in front was unmistakeably his cousin, Dudley Dursley wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful gang
[7018]5641   Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year's hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique
[7019]1135    As Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen, Dudley had recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-school Boxing Champion of the Southeast
[7020]11546    The noble sport', as Uncle Vernon called it, had made Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry in their primary school days when he had served as Dudley's first punchball
[7021]9302    Harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin any more but he still didn't think that Dudley learning to punch harder and more accurately was cause for celebration
[7022]745    Neighbourhood children all around were terrified of him-even more terrified than they were of that Potter boy', who, they had been warned, was a hardened hooligan and attended St
[7023]4807    Brutus's Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys
[7024]6292   Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered who they had been beating up tonight
[7025]6491    Look round, Harry found himself thinking as he watched them
[7026]436    Come on 
[7027]0   
[7028]0   
[7029]582    look round
[7030]0   
[7031]0   
[7032]566    I'm sitting here all alone
[7033]0   
[7034]0   
[7035]436    Come and have a go
[7036]0   
[7037]0   
[7038]6006   If Dudley's friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to make a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then
[7039]9690   He wouldn't want to lose face in front of the gang, but he'd be terrified of provoking Harry
[7040]0   
[7041]0   
[7042]0   
[7043]5388    It would be really fun to watch Dudley's dilemma, to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond 
[7044]0   
[7045]0   
[7046]6368    and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, he was ready-he had his wand
[7047]406    Let them try 
[7048]0   
[7049]0   
[7050]6253    he'd love to vent some of his frustration on the boys who had once made his life hell-But they didn't turn around, they didn't see him, they were almost at the railings
[7051]5741    Harry mastered the impulse to call after them
[7052]0   
[7053]0   
[7054]0   
[7055]48    Seeking a fight was not a smart move
[7056]0   
[7057]0   
[7058]0   
[7059]314    He must not use magic
[7060]0   
[7061]0   
[7062]0   
[7063]13    He would be risking expulsion again
[7064]5535   The voices of Dudley's gang died away; they were out of sight, heading along Magnolia Road
[7065]6789   There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully
[7066]4    Nothing rash
[7067]251    Kept my nose clean
[7068]772    Exactly the opposite of what you'd have done
[7069]0   
[7070]0   
[7071]967   He got to his feet and stretched
[7072]2921    Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to be home, and any time after that was much too late
[7073]12416    Uncle Vernon had threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home after Dudley ever again, so, stifling a yawn, and still scowling, Harry set off toward the park gate
[7074]6502   Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses with perfectly manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners who drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernon's
[7075]6719    Harry preferred Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches of jewel-bright colour in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutters about his delinquent' appearance when he passed the householders
[7076]5778    He walked quickly, so that halfway along Magnolia Road Dudley's gang came into view again; they were saying their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent
[7077]6116    Harry stepped into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited
[7078]0   
[7079]0   
[7080]0   
[7081]3458   squealed like a pig, didn't he
[7082]106  ' Malcolm was saying, to guffaws from the others
[7083]6381   Nice right hook, Big D,' said Piers
[7084]597   Same time tomorrow
[7085]5242  ' said Dudley
[7086]5455   Round at my place, my parents will be out,' said Gordon
[7087]5242   See you then,' said Dudley
[7088]14   Bye, Dud
[7089]679  'See ya, Big D
[7090]5909  'Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off again
[7091]911    When their voices had faded once more he headed around the corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his ease, humming tunelessly
[7092]704   Hey, Big D
[7093]488  'Dudley turned
[7094]382   Oh,' he grunted
[7095]4750    It's you
[7096]1031   'How long have you been Big D then
[7097]10818  ' said Harry
[7098]730   Shut it,' snarled Dudley, turning away
[7099]10990   Cool name,' said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside is cousin
[7100]573    But you'll always be Ickle Diddykins to me
[7101]5191   'I said, SHUT IT
[7102]6201  ' said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled into fists
[7103]8573   Don't the boys know that's what your mum calls you
[7104]626  'Shut your face
[7105]3899   'You don't tell her to shut her face
[7106]106    What about Popkin and Dinky Diddydums", can I use them then
[7107]5242  'Dudley said nothing
[7108]5866    The effort of keeping himself from hitting Harry seemed to demand all his self-control
[7109]756   So who've you been beating up tonight
[7110]6116  ' Harry asked, his grin fading
[7111]367    Another ten-year-old
[7112]1770   I know you did Mark Evans two nights ago-'He was asking for it,' snarled Dudley
[7113]639   Oh yeah
[7114]2  'He cheeked me
[7115]277   'Yeah
[7116]7037   Did he say you look like a pig that's been taught to walk on its hind legs
[7117]9592   Cause that's not cheek, Dud, that's true
[7118]0   
[7119]0   
[7120]4925   'A muscle was twitching in Dudley's jaw
[7121]7399    It gave Harry enormous satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the only outlet he had
[7122]7682   They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a short cut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk
[7123]23    It was empty and much darker than the streets it linked because there were no streetlamps
[7124]259    Their footsteps were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on the other
[7125]3924   Think you're a big man carrying that thing, don't you
[7126]5314  ' Dudley said after a few seconds
[7127]185   What thing
[7128]219  'That-that thing you are hiding
[7129]5747   'Harry grinned again
[7130]531   Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud
[7131]8035   But I s'pose, if you were, you wouldn't be able to walk and talk at the same time
[7132]0   
[7133]0   
[7134]0   
[7135]6313   'Harry pulled out his wand
[7136]988    He saw Dudley look sideways at it
[7137]5288   You're not allowed,' Dudley said at once
[7138]771    I know you're not
[7139]894    You'd get expelled from that freak school you go to
[7140]4552   'How d'you know they haven't changed the rules, Big D
[7141]10572  'They haven't,' said Dudley, though he didn't sound completely convinced
[7142]5830   Harry laughed softly
[7143]3317   You haven't got the guts to take me on without that thing, have you
[7144]193  ' Dudley snarled
[7145]1375   Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat up a ten year old
[7146]787    You know that boxing title you keep banging on about
[7147]192   How old was your opponent
[7148]46   Seven
[7149]0   Eight
[7150]1225  'He was sixteen, for your information,' snarled Dudley, and he was out cold for twenty minutes after I'd finished with him and he was twice as heavy as you
[7151]1598    You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing out-'Running to Daddy now, are you
[7152]10957   Is his ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty Harry's wand
[7153]209  'Not this brave at night, are you
[7154]169  ' sneered Dudley
[7155]192   This is night, Diddykins
[7156]5805    That's what we call it when it goes all dark like this
[7157]408   'I mean when you're in bed
[7158]193  ' Dudley snarled
[7159]179   He had stopped walking
[7160]6050    Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin
[7161]6486   From the little he could see of Dudley's large face, he was wearing a strangely triumphant look
[7162]1930   What d'you mean, I'm not brave when I'm in bed
[7163]10881  ' said Harry, Completely nonplussed
[7164]129    What-am I supposed to be frightened of, pillows or something
[7165]5720  'I heard you last night,' said Dudley breathlessly
[7166]183    Talking in your sleep
[7167]24    Moaning
[7168]852   'What d'you mean
[7169]11007  ' Harry said again, but there was a cold, plunging sensation in his stomach
[7170]232    He had revisited the graveyard last night in his dreams
[7171]1139   Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter, then adopted a high-pitched whimpering voice
[7172]3067   "Don't kill Cedric
[7173]3067   Don't kill Cedric
[7174]4794   Who's Cedric-your boyfriend
[7175]10917  'I-you're lying,' said Harry automatically
[7176]330    But his mouth had gone dry
[7177]3779    He knew Dudley wasn't lying-how else would he know about Cedric
[7178]110  "Dad
[7179]255   Help me, Dad
[7180]5433   He's going to kill me, Dad
[7181]2   Boo hoo
[7182]11060   'Shut up,' said Harry quietly
[7183]731    Shut up, Dudley, I'm warning you
[7184]691  '"Come and help me, Dad
[7185]660   Mum, come and help me
[7186]4826   He's killed Cedric
[7187]255   Dad, help me
[7188]8450   He's going to- Don't you point that thing at me
[7189]350  'Dudley backed into the alley wall
[7190]11268    Harry was pointing the wand directly at Dudley's heart
[7191]19162    Harry could feel fourteen years' hatred of Dudley pounding in his veins-what wouldn't he give to strike now, to jinx Dudley so thoroughly he'd have to crawl home like an insect, struck dumb, sprouting feelers-Don't ever talk about that again,' Harry snarled
[7192]709    D'you understand me
[7193]270  'Point that thing somewhere else
[7194]5174  'I said, do you understand me
[7195]85  'Point it somewhere else
[7196]88  'DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME
[7197]1053  'GET THAT THING AWAY FROM-'Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he had been doused in icy water
[7198]333   Something had happened to the night
[7199]839    The star-strewn indigo sky was suddenly pitch black and lightless-the stars, the moon, the misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished
[7200]288    The distant rumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone
[7201]293    The balmy evening was suddenly piercingly, bitingly cold
[7202]662    They were surrounded by total, impenetrable, silent darkness, as though some giant hand had dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, blinding them
[7203]10412   For a split second Harry thought he had done magic without meaning to, despite the fact that he'd been resisting as hard as he could-then his reason caught up with his senses-he didn't have the power to turn off the stars
[7204]2718    He turned his head this way and that, trying to see something, but the darkness pressed on his eyes like a weightless veil
[7205]16064   Dudley's terrified voice broke in Harry's ear
[7206]821   W-what are you d-doing
[7207]173   St-stop it
[7208]623  'I'm not doing anything
[7209]3046   Shut up and don't move
[7210]2345  'I c-can't see
[7211]834   I've g-gone blind
[7212]5191   I-'I said shut up
[7213]7293  'Harry stood stock still, turning his sightless eyes left and right
[7214]1285    The cold was so intense he was shivering all over; goose bumps had erupted up his arms and the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up-he opened his eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly around, unseeing

[7241]1268    He had heard just the thing he had been dreading
[7242]467   There was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, something that was drawing long, hoarse, rattling breaths
[7243]6446    Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as he stood trembling in the freezing air
[7244]79   C-cut it out
[7245]315   Stop doing it
[7246]685   I'll h-hit you, I swear I will
[7247]264  'Dudley, shut-'WHAM
[7248]11269  A fist made contact with the side of Harry's head, lifting him off his feet
[7249]730    Small white lights popped in front of his eyes
[7250]8658    For the second time in an hour Harry felt as though his head had been cleaved in two; next moment, he had landed hard on the ground and his wand had flown out of his hand
[7251]159   You moron, Dudley
[7252]6796  ' Harry yelled, his eyes watering with pain as he scrambled to his hands and knees, feeling around frantically in the blackness
[7253]832    He heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley fence, stumbling
[7254]592   DUDLEY, COME BACK
[7255]619   YOU'RE RUNNING RIGHT AT IT
[7256]5142  'There was a horrible squealing yell and Dudley's footsteps stopped
[7257]6714    At the same moment, Harry felt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only one thing
[7258]0    There was more than one
[7259]443   DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT
[7260]287   WHATEVER YOU DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT

[7263]5600    Where's-wand-come on-Lumos
[7264]7050  'He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in his search-and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand-the wand tip had ignited
[7265]6341    Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet and turned around
[7266]394   His stomach turned over
[7267]1600   A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly towards him, hovering over the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it came
[7268]6313   Stumbling backwards, Harry raised his wand
[7269]8   Expecto patronum
[7270]14637  'A silvery wisp of vapour shot from the tip of the wand and the Dementor slowed, but the spell hadn't worked properly; tripping over his own feet, Harry retreated further as the Dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain-concentrate-A pair of grey, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the Dementor's robes, reaching for him
[7271]10686    A rushing noise filled Harry's ears
[7272]8   Expecto patronum
[7273]637  'His voice sounded dim and distant

[7275]0   
[7276]0   
[7277]5586    Another wisp of silver smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the wand-he couldn't do it any more, he couldn't work the spell
[7278]942   There was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high-pitched laughter
[7279]0   
[7280]0   
[7281]0   
[7282]5744    He could smell the Dementor's putrid, death-cold breath filling his own lungs, drowning him- Think

[7285]54    something happy
[7286]0

[7289]14   But there was no happiness in him 
[7290]0   
[7291]0   
[7292]12412    the Dementor's icy fingers were closing on his throat-the high-patched laughter was growing louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his head: Bow to death, Harry

[7309]8   EXPECTO PATRONUM
[7310]17515  'An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry's wand; it's antlers caught the Dementor in the place where the heart should have been; it was thrown backwards, weightless as darkness, and as the stag charged, the Dementor swooped away, bat-like and defeated
[7311]355   THIS WAY
[7312]5877  ' Harry shouted at the stag
[7313]581    Wheeling around, he sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft
[7314]156    DUDLEY
[7315]156   DUDLEY
[7316]1258  'He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley was curled up on the ground, his arms clamped over his face
[7317]6574    A second Dementor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy hands, prising them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded head towards Dudley's face as though about to kiss him
[7318]0   
[7319]0   
[7320]0   
[7321]0   GET IT
[7322]6371  ' Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the silver stag he had conjured came galloping past him
[7323]12401    The Dementor's eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley's when the silver antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness; the stag cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist
[7324]205   Moon, stars and streetlamps burst back into life
[7325]98    A warm breeze swept the alleyway
[7326]321    Trees rustled in neighbouring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again
[7327]6275   Harry stood quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to normality
[7328]2650    After a moment, he became aware that his T-shirt was sticking to him; he was drenched in sweat
[7329]1052   He could not believe what had just happened
[7330]388    Dementors here, in Little Whinging
[7331]477   Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and shaking
[7332]6354    Harry bent down to see whether he was in a fit state to stand up, but then he heard loud, running footsteps behind him
[7333]989    Instinctively raising his wand again, he span on his heel to face the newcomer
[7334]369   Mrs
[7335]588    Figg, their batty old neighbour, came panting into sight
[7336]660    Her grizzled grey hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking string shopping bag was swinging from her wrist and her feet were halfway out of her tartan carpet slippers
[7337]9681    Harry made to stow his wand hurriedly out of sight, but-Don't put it away, idiot boy

[7368]221    Figg, wringing her hands
[7369]488    Left to see someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom
[7370]1643   I told him I'd flay him alive if he went, and now look
[7371]83   Dementors
[7372]5954   It's just lucky I put Mr
[7373]66    Tibbles on the case
[7374]3751   But we haven't got time to stand around
[7375]1419   Hurry, now, we've got to get you back
[7376]946   Oh, the trouble this is going to cause
[7377]84   I will kill him
[7378]6511  'But-'The revelation that his batty old cat-obsessed neighbour knew what dementors were was almost as big a shock to Harry as meeting two of them down the alleyway
[7379]84    You're-you're a witch
[7380]966  'I'm a Squib, as Mundungus knows full well, so how on earth was I supposed to help you fight off dementors
[7381]1121   He left you completely without cover when I'd warned him-'This Mundungus has been following me
[7382]18   Hang on-it was him
[7383]216   He Disapparated from the front of my house
[7384]1876  'Yes, yes, yes, but luckily I'd stationed Mr
[7385]10508    Tibbles under a car just in case, and Mr Tibbles came and warned me, but by the time I got to your house you'd gone- and now-oh, what's Dumbledore going to say
[7386]0   You
[7387]486  ' she shrieked at Dudley, still supine on the alley floor
[7388]192    Get your fat bottom off the ground, quick
[7389]1588  'You know Dumbledore
[7390]10995  ' said Harry, staring at her
[7391]5810   Of course I know Dumbledore, who doesn't know Dumbledore
[7392]2280   But come on- I'll be no help if they come back, I've never so much as Transfigured a teabag
[7393]5262   'She stooped down, seized one of Dudley's massive arms in her wizened hands and tugged
[7394]20   Get up, you useless lump, get up
[7395]156  'But Dudley either could not or would not move
[7396]543    He remained on the ground, trembling and ashen-faced, his mouth shut very tight
[7397]567   I'll do it
[7398]11023   ' Harry took hold of Dudley's arm and heaved
[7399]383    With an enormous effort he managed to hoist him to his feet
[7400]245    Dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting
[7401]7526    His small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let go of him he swayed dangerously
[7402]36   Hurry up
[7403]5455  ' said Mrs
[7404]42    Figg hysterically
[7405]11185   Harry pulled one of Dudley's massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him towards the road, sagging slightly under the weight
[7406]369    Mrs
[7407]199    Figg tottered along in front of them, peering anxiously around the corner
[7408]6599   Keep your wand out,' she told Harry, as they entered Wisteria Walk
[7409]5477    Never mind the Statute of Secrecy now, there's going to be hell to pay anyway, we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg

[7411]0   
[7412]0   
[7413]5964    This was exactly what Dumbledore was afraid of-what's that at the end of the street

[7415]1    Prentice
[7416]0   
[7417]0   
[7418]7403    Don't put your wand away, boy, don't I keep telling you I'm no use
[7419]1207  'It was not easy to hold a wand steady and haul Dudley along at the same time
[7420]6256    Harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs, but Dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement
[7421]11200    He was slumped on Harry's shoulder, his large feet dragging along the ground
[7422]3421   Why didn't you tell me you're a Squib, Mrs
[7423]41    Figg
[7424]6192  ' asked Harry, panting with the effort to keep walking
[7425]3606    All those times I came round your house-why didn't you say anything
[7426]5581  'Dumbledore's orders
[7427]467    I was to keep an eye on you but not say anything, you were too young
[7428]8914    I'm sorry I gave you such a miserable time, Harry, but the Dursleys would never have let you come if they'd thought you enjoyed it
[7429]3244    It wasn't easy, you know 
[7430]0   
[7431]0   
[7432]6990    but oh my word,' she said tragically, wringing her hands once more, when Dumbledore hears about this-how could Mundungus have left, he was supposed to be on duty until midnight-where is he
[7433]6531   How am I going to tell Dumbledore what's happened
[7434]15033   I can't Apparate-'I've got an owl, you can borrow her,' Harry groaned, wondering whether his spine was going to snap under Dudley's weight
[7435]8761   Harry, you don't understand
[7436]4584   Dumbledore will need to act as quickly as possible, the Ministry have their own ways of detecting underage magic, they'll know already, you mark my words-'But I was getting rid of dementors, I had to use magic-they're going to be more worried about what dementors were doing floating around Wisteria Walk, surely
[7437]1617  'Oh, my dear, I wish it were so, but I'm afraid- MUNDUNGUS FLETCHER, I AM GOING TO KILL YOU
[7438]1104  'There was a loud crack and a strong smell of drink mingled with stale tobacco filled the air as a squat, unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialised right in front of them
[7439]1858    He had short, bandy legs, long straggly ginger hair and bloodshot, baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound
[7440]5946    He was also clutching a silvery bundle that Harry recognised at once as an Invisibility Cloak
[7441]4752   ' S' up, Figgy
[7442]5632  ' he said, staring from Mrs
[7443]5929    Figg to Harry and Dudley
[7444]21    What appened to staying undercover
[7445]569  'I'll give you undercover

[7448]122    Dementors, you useless, skiving sneak thief
[7449]83  'Dementors

[7451]83    Dementors, here
[7452]350  'Yes, here, you worthless pile of bat droppings, here
[7453]398  ' shrieked Mrs
[7454]41    Figg
[7455]313    Dementors attacking the boy on your watch
[7456]6159  'Blimey,' said Mundungus weakly, looking from Mrs
[7457]5773    Figg to Harry, and back again
[7458]17    Blimey, I
[7459]0   
[7460]0   
[7461]26   'And you off buying stolen cauldrons

[7471]369   'Mrs
[7472]1159    Figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and whacked Mundungus around the face and neck with it; judging by the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food
[7473]313   Ouch-gerroff- gerroff, you mad old bat
[7474]5906   Someone's gotta tell Dumbledore
[7475]292  'Yes-they- have
[7476]448  ' yelled Mrs
[7477]490    Figg, swinging the bag of cat food at every bit of Mundungus she could reach

[7481]1860    I'm going, I'm going
[7482]181  'And with another loud crack, he vanished
[7483]884   I hope Dumbledore murders him

[7485]90    Figg furiously
[7486]6252    Now come on, Harry, what are you waiting for
[7487]11008  'Harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out that he could barely walk under Dudley's bulk
[7488]410    He gave the semi-conscious Dudley a heave and staggered onwards
[7489]6520   I'll take you to the door,' said Mrs
[7490]443    Figg, as they turned into Privet Drive
[7491]871    Just in case there are more of them around

[7520]1200    Did you expect him to let you wander around on your own after what happened in June
[7521]885   Good Lord, boy, they told me you were intelligent

[7529]162    I expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough
[7530]489   'What are you going to do
[7531]6243  ' asked Harry quickly
[7532]6557   I'm going straight home,' said Mrs
[7533]577    Figg, staring around the dark street and shuddering
[7534]843    I'll need to wait for more instructions
[7535]1091    Just stay in the house

[7537]2959   'Hang on, don't go yet

[7539]291    Figg had already set off at a trot, carpet slippers flopping, string bag clanking
[7540]77   Wait

[7542]1437    He had a million questions to ask anyone who was in contact with Dumbledore; but within seconds Mrs
[7543]111    Figg was swallowed by the darkness
[7544]11272    Scowling, Harry readjusted Dudley on his shoulder and made his slow, painful way up number four's garden path
[7545]341   The hall light was on
[7546]12205    Harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans, rang the bell and watched Aunt Petunia's outline grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door
[7547]7   Diddy
[7548]5888   About time too, I was getting quite-quite- Diddy, what's the matter
[7549]8108  'Harry looked sideways at Dudley and ducked out from under his arm just in time
[7550]1118    Dudley swayed on the spot for a moment, his face pale green 
[7551]0   
[7552]0   
[7553]355    then he opened his mouth and vomited all over the doormat
[7554]7   DIDDY

[7556]150   Vernon
[7557]150   VERNON
[7558]12026  'Harry's uncle came galumphing out of the living room, walrus moustache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated
[7559]738    He hurried forwards to help Aunt Petunia negotiate a weak-kneed Dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick
[7560]4918   He's ill, Vernon
[7561]40  'What is it, son
[7562]4893   What's happened
[7563]1036   Did Mrs
[7564]41    Polkiss give you something foreign for tea

[7573]5844  'In all the kerfuffle nobody seemed to have noticed Harry, which suited him perfectly
[7574]8384    He managed to slip inside just before Uncle Vernon slammed the door and, while the Dursleys made their noisy progress down the hall towards the kitchen, Harry moved carefully and quietly towards the stairs
[7575]707   Who did it, son
[7576]26   Give us names
[7577]3553    We'll get them, don't worry
[7578]7   'Shh

[7586]436   COME HERE
[7587]6617  'With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, Harry removed his foot slowly from the stair and turned to follow the Dursleys
[7588]307   The scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the darkness outside
[7589]1164    Aunt Petunia was ushering Dudley into a chair; he was still very green and clammy-looking
[7590]6804    Uncle Vernon was standing in front of the draining board, glaring at Harry through tiny, narrowed eyes
[7591]40   What have you done to my son
[7592]5093  ' he said in a menacing growl
[7593]13714   Nothing,' said Harry, knowing perfectly well that Uncle Vernon wouldn't believe him
[7594]674   What did he do to you, Diddy
[7595]10795  ' Aunt Petunia said in a quavering voice, now sponging sick from the front of Dudley's leather jacket
[7596]776    Was it-was it you-know-what, darling
[7597]954   Did he use-his thing
[7598]342  'Slowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded
[7599]2708   I didn't
[7600]11856  ' Harry said sharply, as Aunt Petunia let out a wail and Uncle Vernon raised his fists
[7601]5806    I didn't do anything to him, it wasn't me, it was-'But at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window
[7602]18305    Narrowly missing the top of Uncle Vernon's head, it soared across the kitchen, dropped the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at Harry's feet, turned gracefully, the tips of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside again and off across the garden
[7603]63   OWLS
[7604]823  ' bellowed Uncle Vernon, the well-worn vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut
[7605]63    OWLS AGAIN
[7606]275   I WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE OWLS IN MY HOUSE
[7607]11237  'But Harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out the letter inside, his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his Adam's apple
[7608]462   Dear Mr
[7609]1146    Potter,We have received intelligence that you performed the Patronus Charm at twenty-three minutes past nine this evening in a Muggle-inhabited area and in the presence of a Muggle
[7610]573   The severity of this breach of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
[7611]878    Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand
[7612]710   As you have already received an official warning for a previous offence under Section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks' Statute of Secrecy, we regret to inform you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic at 9 a
[7613]441   m
[7614]20    on the twelfth of August
[7615]601   Hoping you are well,Yours sincerely,Mafalda HopkirkImproper Use of Magic OfficeMinistry of MagicHarry read the letter through twice
[7616]715    He was only vaguely aware of Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia talking
[7617]715    Inside his head, all was icy and numb
[7618]822    One fact had penetrated his consciousness like a paralysing dart
[7619]283    He was expelled from Hogwarts
[7620]0    It was all over
[7621]489    He was never going back
[7622]748   He looked up at the Dursleys
[7623]1003    Uncle Vernon was purple-faced, shouting, his fists still raised; Aunt Petunia had her arms around Dudley who was retching again
[7624]10536   Harry's temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken
[7625]878    Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand
[7626]185    There was only one thing for it
[7627]70    He would have to run-now
[7628]10729    Where he was going to go, Harry didn't know but he was certain of one thing: at Hogwarts or outside it, he needed his wand
[7629]1138    In an almost dreamlike state, he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the kitchen
[7630]1672   Where d'you think you're going
[7631]241  ' yelled Uncle Venon
[7632]8778    When Harry didn't reply, he pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall
[7633]2640    I haven't finished with you, boy
[7634]11310  'Get out of the way,' said Harry quietly
[7635]16146   You're going to stay here and explain how my son-'If you don't get out of the way I'm going to jinx you,' said Harry, raising the wand
[7636]2333   You can't pull that one on me
[7637]348  ' snarled Uncle Vernon
[7638]1274    I know you're not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school
[7639]10826  'The madhouse has chucked me out,' said Harry
[7640]734    So I can do whatever I like
[7641]1455    You've got three seconds
[7642]158    One-two-'A resounding CRACK filled the kitchen
[7643]7154    Aunt Petunia screamed, Uncle Vernon yelled and ducked, but for the third time that night Harry was searching for the source of a disturbance he had not made
[7644]2268    He spotted it at once: a dazed and ruffled-looking barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill, having just collided with the closed window
[7645]5164   Ignoring Uncle Vernon's anguished yell of OWLS
[7646]6707  ' Harry crossed the room at a run and wrenched the window open
[7647]6925    The owl stuck out its leg, to which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook its feathers, and took off the moment Harry had taken the letter
[7648]6563    Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the second message, which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink
[7649]17446   Harry-Dumbledore's just arrived at the Ministry and he's trying to sort it all out
[7650]5350    DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE'S HOUSE
[7651]212    DO NOT DO ANY MORE MAGIC
[7652]411    DO NOT SURRENDER YOUR WAND
[7653]370   Arthur WeasleyDumbledore was trying to sort it all out 
[7654]0   
[7655]0   
[7656]898    what did that mean
[7657]1960   how much power did Dumbledore have to override the Ministry of Magic
[7658]341   Was there a chance that he might be allowed back to Hogwarts, then
[7659]11726   A small shoot of hope burgeoned in Harry's chest, almost immediately strangled by panic-how was he supposed to refuse to surrender his wand without doing magic
[7660]2573   He'd have to duel with the Ministry representatives, and if he did that, he'd be lucky to escape Azkaban, let alone expulsion
[7661]161   His mind was racing
[7662]0   
[7663]0   
[7664]0   
[7665]462    He could run for it and risk being captured by the Ministry, or stay put and wait for them to find him here
[7666]874    He was much more tempted by the former course, but he knew Mr
[7667]828    Weasley had his best interests at heart 
[7668]0   
[7669]0   
[7670]879    and, after all, Dumbledore had sorted out much worse than this before
[7671]0   
[7672]0   
[7673]0   
[7674]12705   Right,' Harry said, I've changed my mind, I'm staying
[7675]714   'He flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced Dudley and Aunt Petunia
[7676]440    The Dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt change of mind
[7677]577    Aunt Petunia glanced despairingly at Uncle Vernon
[7678]118    The vein in his purple temple was throbbing worse than ever
[7679]75   Who are all these ruddy owls from
[7680]32  ' he growled
[7681]11284   The first one was from the Ministry of Magic, expelling me,' said Harry calmly
[7682]5869    He was straining his ears to catch any noises outside, in case the Ministry representatives were approaching, and it was easier and quieter to answer Uncle Vernon's questions than to have him start raging and bellowing
[7683]7317    The second one was from my friend Ron's dad, who works at the Ministry
[7684]432   'Ministry of Magic
[7685]345  ' bellowed Uncle Vernon
[7686]1047    People like you in government
[7687]5644   Oh, this explains everything, everything, no wonder the country's going to the dogs
[7688]0   
[7689]0   
[7690]0   
[7691]6798   'When Harry did not respond, Uncle Vernon glared at him, then spat out, And why have you been expelled
[7692]879  'Because I did magic
[7693]5   'AHA
[7694]6035  ' roared Uncle Vernon, slamming his fist down on top of the fridge, which sprang open; several of Dudley's low-fat snacks toppled out and burst on the floor
[7695]15    So you admit it
[7696]823   What did you do to Dudley
[7697]11013  'Nothing,' said Harry, slightly less calmly
[7698]9271    That wasn't me-'Was,' muttered Dudley unexpectedly, and Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia instantly made flapping gestures at Harry to quieten him while they both bent low over Dudley
[7699]6104   Go on, son,' said Uncle Vernon, what did he do
[7700]665  'Tell us, darling,' whispered Aunt Petunia
[7701]671   Pointed his wand at me,' Dudley mumbled
[7702]9690   Yeah, I did, but I didn't use-' Harry began angrily, but
[7703]0   
[7704]0   
[7705]105   SHUT UP
[7706]565  ' roared Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia in unison
[7707]469   Go on, son,' repeated Uncle Vernon, moustache blowing about furiously
[7708]5572   All dark,' Dudley said hoarsely, shuddering
[7709]310    Everything dark
[7710]275    And then I h-heard 
[7711]0   
[7712]0   
[7713]134    things
[7714]1129    Inside m-my head
[7715]0   
[7716]0   
[7717]664   'Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia exchanged looks of utter horror
[7718]1993    If their least favourite thing in the world was magic, closely followed by neighbours who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban, people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten
[7719]764    They obviously thought Dudley was losing his mind
[7720]1062   What sort of things did you hear, popkin
[7721]866  ' breathed Aunt Petunia, very white-faced and with tears in her eyes
[7722]263   But Dudley seemed incapable of saying
[7723]7052    He shuddered again and shook his large blond head, and despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on Harry since the arrival of the first owl, he felt a certain curiosity
[7724]337    Dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of their life
[7725]0   
[7726]0   
[7727]0   
[7728]388    What would spoiled, pampered, bullying Dudley have been forced to hear
[7729]620  How come you fell over, son
[7730]6723  ' said Uncle Vernon, in an unnaturally quiet voice, the kind of voice he might adopt at the bedside of a very ill person
[7731]7567   T-tripped,' said Dudley shakily
[7732]92    And then-'He gestured at his massive chest
[7733]6162    Harry understood: Dudley was remembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you
[7734]226   Horrible,' croaked Dudley
[7735]104    Cold
[7736]392    Really cold
[7737]11778   'OK,' said Uncle Vernon, in a voice of forced calm, while Aunt Petunia laid an anxious hand on Dudley's forehead to feel his temperature
[7738]145    What happened then, Dudders
[7739]280  'Felt 
[7740]0   
[7741]0

[7751]0    as if
[7752]0   
[7753]0   
[7754]6430   'As if you'd never be happy again,' Harry supplied dully
[7755]610   Yes,' Dudley whispered, still trembling
[7756]0   So
[7757]5965  ' said Uncle Vernon, voice restored to full and considerable volume as he straightened up
[7758]1695    You put some crackpot spell on my on so he'd hear voices and believe he was-was doomed to misery, or something, did you
[7759]401  'How many times do I have to tell you
[7760]11420  ' said Harry, temper and voice both rising
[7761]2449    It wasn't me
[7762]139   It was a couple of dementors
[7763]4807  'A couple of-what's this codswallop
[7764]11027  'De-men-tors,' said Harry slowly and clearly
[7765]0    Two of them
[7766]100   'And what the ruddy hell are dementors
[7767]5526  'They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban,' said Aunt Petunia
[7768]1601   Two seconds of ringing silence followed these words before Aunt Petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a disgusting swear word
[7769]317    Uncle Vernon was goggling at her
[7770]10532    Harry's brain reeled
[7771]369    Mrs
[7772]327    Figg was one thing-butAunt Petunia
[7773]1392  How d'you know that
[7774]360  ' he asked her, astonished
[7775]1077   Aunt Petunia looked quite appalled with herself
[7776]992    She glanced at Uncle Vernon in fearful apology, then lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsy teeth
[7777]5846   I heard-that awful boy-telling her about them-years ago,' she said jerkily
[7778]3489   If you mean my mum and dad, why don't you use their names
[7779]11182  ' said Harry loudly but Aunt Petunia ignored him
[7780]31    She seemed horribly flustered
[7781]5752   Harry was stunned
[7782]11602    Except for one outburst years ago, in the course of which Aunt Petunia had screamed that Harry's mother had been a freak, he had never heard her mention her sister
[7783]3371    He was astounded that she had remembered this scrap of information about the magical world for so long, when she usually put all her energies into pretending it didn't exist
[7784]2517   Uncle Vernon opened his mouth, closed it again, opened it once more, shut it, then, apparently struggling to remember how to talk, opened it for a third time and croaked, So-so-they-er-they-er-they actually exist, do they-er- Dementy-whatsits
[7785]263  'Aunt Petunia nodded
[7786]7675   Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to Harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout April Fool
[7787]1340  ' When nobody did, he opened his mouth yet again, but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening
[7788]1658    It zoomed through the still-open window like a feathery cannon-ball and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the Dursleys to jump with fright
[7789]12004    Harry tore a second official-looking envelope from the owl's beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped back out into the night
[7790]64   Enough-effing-owls
[7791]0   
[7792]0   
[7793]704   ' muttered Uncle Vernon distractedly, stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again
[7794]462   Dear Mr
[7795]1602    Potter,Further to our letter of approximately twenty-two minutes ago, the Ministry of Magic has revised its decision to destroy your wand forthwith
[7796]1159    You may retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on the twelfth of August, at which time an official decision will be taken
[7797]1477   Following discussions with the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that time
[7798]250    You should therefore consider yourself suspended from school pending further enquiries
[7799]764   With best wishes,Yours sincerely,Mafalda HopkirkImproper Use of Magic OfficeMinistry of MagicHarry read this letter through three times in quick succession
[7800]444    The miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly with the relief of knowing he was not yet definitely expelled, though his fears were by no means banished
[7801]101    Everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of August
[7802]0   Well
[7803]11134  ' said Uncle Vernon, recalling Harry to his surroundings
[7804]0    What now
[7805]3   Have they sentenced you to anything
[7806]261   Do your lot have the death penalty
[7807]106  ' he added as a hopeful afterthought
[7808]12264   I've got to go to a hearing,' said Harry
[7809]581   And they'll sentence you there
[7810]63  'I suppose so
[7811]7911   'I won't give up hope, then,' said Uncle Vernon nastily
[7812]15925   Well, if that's all,' said Harry, getting to his feet
[7813]4952    He was desperate to be alone, to think, perhaps to send a letter to Ron, Hermione or Sirius
[7814]12   NO, IT RUDDY WELL IS NOT ALL
[7815]345  ' bellowed Uncle Vernon
[7816]43    SIT BACK DOWN
[7817]0  'What now
[7818]10863  ' said Harry impatiently
[7819]156   DUDLEY
[7820]358  ' roared Uncle Vernon
[7821]1390    I want to know exactly what happened to my son
[7822]75  'FINE
[7823]7053  ' yelled Harry, and in his temper, red and gold sparks shot out of the end of his wand, still clutched in his hand
[7824]713    All three Dursleys flinched, looking terrified
[7825]11278   Dudley and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk,' said Harry, speaking fast, fighting to control his temper
[7826]4562    Dudley thought he'd be smart with me, I pulled out my wand but didn't use it
[7827]417    Then two dementors turned up-'But what ARE Dementoids
[7828]716  ' asked Uncle Vernon furiously
[7829]0    What do they DO
[7830]11229  'I told you-they suck all the happiness out of you,' said Harry, and if they get the chance, they kiss you-'Kiss you
[7831]6058  ' said Uncle Vernon, his eyes popping slightly
[7832]9    Kiss you
[7833]4942  'It's what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth
[7834]267   'Aunt Petunia uttered a soft scream
[7835]8   His soul
[7836]8882   They didn't take-he's still got his-'She seized Dudley by the shoulders and shook him, as though testing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him
[7837]15153   Of course they didn't get his soul, you'd know if they had,' said Harry, exasperated
[7838]772   Fought em off, did you, son
[7839]5789  ' said Uncle Vernon loudly, with the appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back on to a plane he understood
[7840]1130    Gave em the old one-two, did you
[7841]13408  'You can't give a Dementor the old one-two,' said Harry through clenched teeth
[7842]5307   Why's he all right, then
[7843]314  ' blustered Uncle Vernon
[7844]2409    Why isn't he all empty, then
[7845]98  'Because I used the Patronus-'WHOOSH
[7846]587    With a clattering, a whirring of wings and a soft fall of dust, a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace
[7847]4770   FOR GOD'S SAKE
[7848]4183  ' roared Uncle Vernon, pulling great clumps of hair out of his moustache, something he hadn't been driven to do in a long time
[7849]398    I WILL NOT HAVE OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS, I TELL YOU
[7850]10828  'But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the owl's leg
[7851]1389    He was so convinced that this letter had to be from Dumbledore, explaining everything-the dementors, Mrs
[7852]7215    Figg, what the Ministry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to sort everything out-that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see Sirius's handwriting
[7853]12549    Ignoring Uncle Vernons ongoing rant about owls, and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney, Harry read Sirius's message
[7854]6089   Arthur has just told us what's happened
[7855]3275    Don't leave the house again, whatever you do
[7856]7215   Harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over, looking for the rest of the letter, but there was nothing else
[7857]63   And now his temper was rising again
[7858]3408    Wasn't anybody going to say well done' for fighting off two dementors single-handed
[7859]372   Both Mr
[7860]1949    Weasley and Sirius were acting as though he'd misbehaved, and were saving their tellings-off until they could ascertain how much damage had been done
[7861]539   -a peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house
[7862]18923    I won't have it, boy, I won't-'I can't stop the owls coming,' Harry snapped, crushing Sirius's letter in his fist
[7863]563   I want the truth about what happened tonight
[7864]326  ' barked Uncle Vernon
[7865]1390    If it was demenders who hurt Dudley, how come you've been expelled
[7866]2140   You did you-know-what, you've admitted, it
[7867]6112  'Harry took a deep, steadying breath
[7868]503    His head was beginning to ache again
[7869]673    He wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen, and away from the Dursleys
[7870]6004   I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the dementors,' he said, forcing himself to remain calm
[7871]4948    It's the only thing that works against them
[7872]489   'But what were Dementoids doing in Little Whinging
[7873]5435  ' said Uncle Vernon in an outraged tone
[7874]13599   Couldn't tell you,' said Harry wearily
[7875]111    No idea
[7876]515   'His head was pounding in the glare of the strip-lighting now
[7877]387    His anger was ebbing away
[7878]301    He felt drained, exhausted
[7879]249    The Dursleys were all staring at him
[7880]10161   It's you,' said Uncle Vernon forcefully
[7881]6343    It's got something to do with you, boy, I know it
[7882]70    Why else would they turn up here
[7883]19   Why else would they be down that alleyway
[7884]4364   You've got to be the only-the only-' Evidently, he couldn't bring himself to say the word wizard'
[7885]787    The only you-know-what for miles
[7886]3712   'I don't know why they were here
[7887]15837   'But at Uncle Vernon's words, Harry's exhausted brain had ground back into action
[7888]824    Why had the dementors come to Little Whinging
[7889]5823   How could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where Harry was
[7890]78   Had they been sent
[7891]610   Had the Ministry of Magic lost control of the dementors
[7892]1169   Had they deserted Azkaban and joined Voldemort, as Dumbledore had predicted they would
[7893]40  These demembers guard some weirdo prison
[7894]11620  ' asked Uncle Vernon, lumbering along in the wake of Harry's train of thought
[7895]11110   Yes,' said Harry
[7896]2561   If only his head would stop hurting, if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think
[7897]0   
[7898]0   
[7899]0   
[7900]3   Oho
[7901]113   They were coming to arrest you
[7902]5706  ' said Uncle Vernon, with the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion
[7903]7291    That's it, isn't it, boy
[7904]87   You're on the run from the law
[7905]12266  'Of course I'm not,' said Harry, shaking his head as though to scare off a fly, his mind racing now
[7906]0   Then why-
[7907]11344  'He must have sent them,' said Harry quietly, more to himself than to Uncle Vernon
[7908]4750   What's that
[7909]78   Who must have sent them
[7910]11138  'Lord Voldemort,' said Harry
[7911]2939   He registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who flinched, winced and squawked if they heard words like wizard', magic' or wand', could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor
[7912]7095   Lord-hang on,' said Uncle Vernon, his face screwed up, a look of dawning comprehension coming into his piggy eyes
[7913]964    I've heard that name 
[7914]0   
[7915]0   
[7916]0    that was the one who
[7917]0   
[7918]0   
[7919]11205   'Murdered my parents, yes,' Harry said dully
[7920]20974   But he's gone,' said Uncle Vernon impatiently, without the slightest sign that the murder of Harry's parents might be a painful topic
[7921]5152    That giant bloke said so
[7922]4879    He's gone
[7923]15616   'He's back,' said Harry heavily
[7924]6418   It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunia's surgically clean kitchen, beside the top-of-the-range fridge and the wide-screen television, talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon
[7925]1134    The arrival of the dementors in Little Whinging seemed to have breached the great, invisible wall that divided the relentlessly non-magical world of Privet Drive and the world beyond
[7926]11503    Harry's two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned upside-down; the Dursleys were asking for details about the magical world, and Mrs
[7927]1854    Figg knew Albus Dumbledore; dementors were soaring around Little Whinging, and he might never return to Hogwarts
[7928]10989    Harry's head throbbed more painfully
[7929]0   Back
[7930]328  ' whispered Aunt Petunia
[7931]7013   She was looking at Harry as she had never looked at him before
[7932]11474    And all of a sudden, for the very first time in his life, Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was his mother's sister
[7933]5448    He could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment
[7934]1354    All he knew was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what Lord Voldemort being back might mean
[7935]1695    Aunt Petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before
[7936]905    Her large, pale eyes (so unlike her sisters) were not narrowed in dislike or anger, they were wide and fearful
[7937]11812    The furious pretence that Aunt Petunia had maintained all Harry's life-that there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with Uncle Vernon-seemed to have fallen away
[7938]11486   Yes,' Harry said, talking directly to Aunt Petunia now
[7939]338    He came back a month ago
[7940]326    I saw him
[7941]5169   'Her hands found Dudley's massive leather-clad shoulders and clutched them
[7942]11878   Hang on,' said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife to Harry and back again, apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them
[7943]18    Hang on
[7944]5108    This Lord Voldything's back, you say
[7945]292   'Yes
[7946]73   'The one who murdered your parents
[7947]292   'Yes
[7948]4771   'And now he's sending dismembers after you
[7949]11640  'Looks like it,' said Harry
[7950]11879   I see,' said Uncle Vernon, looking from his white-faced wife to Harry and hitching up his trousers
[7951]11810    He seemed to be swelling, his great purple face stretching before Harry's eyes
[7952]5450    Well, that settles it,' he said, his shirt front straining as he inflated himself, you can get out of this house, boy
[7953]0  'What
[7954]10818  ' said Harry
[7955]271   You heard me-OUT
[7956]751  ' Uncle Vernon bellowed, and even Aunt Petunia and Dudley jumped
[7957]0    OUT
[7958]0   OUT
[7959]939   I should've done this years ago
[7960]6465   Owls treating the place like a rest home, puddings exploding, half the lounge destroyed, Dudley's tail, Marge bobbing around on the ceiling and that flying Ford Anglia-OUT
[7961]0   OUT
[7962]693   You've had it
[7963]23   You're history
[7964]6535   You're not staying here if some loony's after you, you're not endangering my wife and son, you're not bringing trouble down on us, if you're going the same way as your useless parents, I've had it
[7965]0   OUT
[7966]5920  'Harry stood rooted to the spot
[7967]629    The letters from the Ministry, Mr
[7968]1915    Weasley and Sirius were all crushed in his left hand
[7969]3275    Don't leave the house again, whatever you do
[7970]5350    DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE'S HOUSE
[7971]271   You heard me
[7972]17708  ' said Uncle Vernon, bending forwards now, his massive purple face coming so close to Harry's, he actually felt flecks of spit hit his face
[7973]489    Get going
[7974]473   You were all keen to leave half an hour ago
[7975]998   I'm right behind you
[7976]7   Get out and never darken our doorstep again
[7977]4574   Why we ever kept you in the first place, I don't know, Marge was right, it should have been the orphanage
[7978]2724    We were too damn soft for our own good, thought we could squash it out of you, thought we could turn you normal, but you've been rotten from the beginning and I've had enough-OWLS
[7979]926  'The fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech
[7980]8255    Harry raised his hand to seize the letter, which was in a scarlet envelope, but it soared straight over his head, flying directly at Aunt Petunia, who let out a scream and ducked, her arms over her face
[7981]1277    The owl dropped the red envelope on her head, turned, and flew straight back up the chimney
[7982]6133   Harry darted forwards to pick up the letter, but Aunt Petunia beat him to it
[7983]12639   You can open it if you like,' said Harry, but I'll hear what it says anyway
[7984]4763    That's a Howler
[7985]420   'Let go of it, Petunia
[7986]358  ' roared Uncle Vernon
[7987]3020    Don't touch it, it could be dangerous
[7988]10689  'It's addressed to me,' said Aunt Petunia in a shaking voice
[7989]5370    It's addressed to me, Vernon, look
[7990]369   Mrs
[7991]541    Petunia Dursley, The Kitchen, Number Four, Privet Drive-'She caught her breath, horrified
[7992]155    The red envelope had begun to smoke
[7993]245   Open it
[7994]5738  ' Harry urged her
[7995]0    Get it over with
[7996]614   It'll happen anyway
[7997]0   'No
[7998]5350   'Aunt Petunia's hand was trembling
[7999]1601    She looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route, but too late-the envelope burst into flames
[8000]315    Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped it
[8001]1055   An awful voice filled the kitchen, echoing in the confined space, issuing from the burning letter on the table
[8002]205   REMEMBER MY LAST, PETUNIA
[8003]901   'Aunt Petunia looked as though she might faint
[8004]1006    She sank into the chair beside Dudley, her face in her hands
[8005]122    The remains of the envelope smouldered into ash in the silence
[8006]0   What is this
[8007]5407  ' Uncle Vernon said hoarsely
[8008]3041    What-I don't-Petunia
[8009]5291  'Aunt Petunia said nothing
[8010]898    Dudley was staring stupidly at his mother, his mouth hanging open
[8011]105    The silence spiralled horribly
[8012]6604    Harry was watching his aunt, utterly bewildered, his head throbbing fit to burst
[8013]190   Petunia, dear
[8014]5402  ' said Uncle Vernon timidly
[8015]121    P-Petunia
[8016]612  'She raised her head
[8017]39    She was still trembling
[8018]22    She swallowed
[8019]5593   The boy-the boy will have to stay, Vernon,' she said weakly
[8020]18   W-what
[8021]5089  'He stays,' she said
[8022]6337    She was not looking at Harry
[8023]934    She got to her feet again
[8024]0   He 
[8025]0   
[8026]0   
[8027]100    but Petunia
[8028]0   
[8029]0   
[8030]5236   'If we throw him out, the neighbours will talk,' she said
[8031]173    She was rapidly regaining her usual brisk, snappish manner, though she was still very pale
[8032]7281    They'll ask awkward questions, they'll want to know where he's gone
[8033]567    We'll have to keep him
[8034]1238   'Uncle Vernon was deflating like an old tyre
[8035]418   But Petunia, dear-'Aunt Petunia ignored him
[8036]6064    She turned to Harry
[8037]5602   You're to stay in your room,' she said
[8038]334    You're not to leave the house
[8039]177    Now get to bed
[8040]8440   'Harry didn't move
[8041]13   Who was that Howler from
[8042]3349  'Don't ask questions,' Aunt Petunia snapped
[8043]137   Are you in touch with wizards
[8044]499  'I told you to get to bed
[8045]898  'What did it mean
[8046]105   Remember the last what
[8047]177  'Go to bed
[8048]436  'How come-

[8067]697    Lionfish 11/Nov/2007     Chapter Three     The Advance GuardContents  Prev Chapter  Next Chapter  
[8068]1925     I've just been attacked by dementors and I might be expelled from Hogwarts
[8069]7275    I want to know what's going on and when I'm going to get out of here
[8070]6871   Harry copied these words on to three separate pieces of parchment the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom
[8071]4438    He addressed the first to Sirius, the second to Ron, and the third to Hermione
[8072]520    His owl, Hedwig, was off hunting; her cage stood empty on the desk
[8073]7417    Harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back, his head pounding, his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and itched with tiredness
[8074]1168    His back ached from hauling Dudley home, and the two lumps on his head where the window and Dudley had hit him were throbbing painfully
[8075]1199   Up and down he paced, consumed with anger and frustration, grinding his teeth and clenching his fists, casting angry looks out at the empty, star-strewn sky every time he passed the window
[8076]530    Dementors sent to get him, Mrs
[8077]1466    Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing him in secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Ministry of Magic-and still no one was telling him what was going on
[8078]13   And what, what, had that Howler been about
[8079]676   Whose voice had echoed so horribly, so menacingly, through the kitchen
[8080]50  Why was he still trapped here without information
[8081]743   Why was everyone treating him like some naughty kid
[8082]3436   Don't do any more magic, stay in the house
[8083]0   
[8084]0   
[8085]1353   He kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far from relieving his anger he felt worse, as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his body
[8086]2211   Just as he limped past the window, Hedwig soared through it with a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost
[8087]556   About time
[8088]5849  ' Harry snarled, as she landed lightly on top of her cage
[8089]1486    You can put that down, I've got work for you
[8090]5826  'Hedwig's large, round, amber eyes gazed at him reproachfully over the dead frog clamped in her beak
[8091]11596   Come here,' said Harry, picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg
[8092]8432    Take these straight to Sirius, Ron and Hermione and don't come back here without good long replies
[8093]2182    Keep pecking them till they've written decent-length answers if you've got to
[8094]88    Understand
[8095]456  'Hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise, her beak still full of frog
[8096]11307   Get going, then,' said Harry
[8097]258   She took off immediately
[8098]7497    The moment she'd gone, Harry threw himself down on his bed without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling
[8099]1406    In addition to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty that he'd been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend he had at number four, Privet Drive
[8100]5321    But he'd make it up to her when she came back with the answers from Sirius, Ron and Hermione
[8101]2785   They were bound to write back quickly; they couldn't possibly ignore a Dementor attack
[8102]877    He'd probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to The Burrow
[8103]573    And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, stifling all further thought
[8104]2948   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------But Hedwig didn't return next morning
[8105]6076    Harry spent the day in his bedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom
[8106]1359    Three times that day Aunt Petunia shoved food into his room through the cat-flap Uncle Vernon had installed three summers ago
[8107]7475    Every time Harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the Howler, but he might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got
[8108]293    Otherwise, the Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom
[8109]9459    Harry couldn't see the point of forcing his company on them; another row would achieve nothing except perhaps make him so angry he'd perform more illegal magic
[8110]274   So it went on for three whole days
[8111]8380    Harry was alternately filled with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything, during which time he paced his bedroom, furious at the whole lot of them for leaving him to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into space, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing
[8112]1   What if they ruled against him
[8113]678   What if he was expelled and his wand was snapped in half
[8114]0   What would he do, where would he go
[8115]1339   He could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged
[8116]0   
[8117]0   
[8118]0   
[8119]6912    Might he be able to move into Sirius's house, as Sirius had suggested a year ago, before he had been forced to flee from the Ministry
[8120]5905   Would Harry be allowed to live there alone, given that he was still underage
[8121]322   Or would the matter of where he went next be decided for him
[8122]117   Had his breach of the International Statute of Secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in Azkaban
[8123]6501   Whenever this thought occurred, Harry invariably slid off his bed and began pacing again
[8124]11792   On the fourth night after Hedwig's departure Harry was lying in one of his apathetic phases, staring at the ceiling, his exhausted mind quite blank, when his uncle entered his bedroom
[8125]6534    Harry looked slowly around at him
[8126]612    Uncle Vernon was wearing his best suit and an expression of enormous smugness
[8127]5575   We're going out,' he said
[8128]95   Sorry
[8129]1020  'We-that is to say, your aunt, Dudley and I-are going out
[8130]11593   'Fine,' said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling
[8131]510   You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away
[8132]82   'OK
[8133]46   'You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our possessions
[8134]557   'Right
[8135]48   'You are not to steal food from the fridge
[8136]82   'OK
[8137]1003   'I am going to lock your door
[8138]0   'You do that
[8139]7222   'Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of this lack of argument, then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind him
[8140]11386    Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon's footsteps walking heavily down the stairs
[8141]1036    A few minutes later he heard the slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakeable sound of the car sweeping out of the drive
[8142]6047   Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving
[8143]225    It made no difference to him whether they were in the house or not
[8144]265    He could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light
[8145]2428    The room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the night sounds through the window he kept open all the time, waiting for the blessed moment when Hedwig returned
[8146]222   The empty house creaked around him
[8147]7    The pipes gurgled
[8148]6009    Harry lay there in a kind of stupor, thinking of nothing, suspended in misery
[8149]583   Then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen below
[8150]226   He sat bolt upright, listening intently
[8151]5440    The Dursleys couldn't be back, it was much too soon, and in any case he hadn't heard their car
[8152]199   There was silence for a few seconds, then voices
[8153]1423   Burglars, he thought, sliding off the bed on to his feet-but a split second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not troubling to do so
[8154]1436   He snatched up his wand from the bedside table and stood facing his bedroom door, listening with all his might
[8155]1434    Next moment, he jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open
[8156]7079   Harry stood motionless, staring through the open doorway at the dark upstairs landing, straining his ears for further sounds, but none came
[8157]1406    He hesitated for a moment, then moved swiftly and silently out of his room to the head of the stairs
[8158]203   His heart shot upwards into his throat
[8159]2034    There were people standing in the shadowy hall below, silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through the glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far as he could see, looking up at him
[8160]11180   Lower your wand, boy, before you take someone's eye out,' said a low, growling voice
[8161]10598   Harry's heart was thumping uncontrollably
[8162]1915    He knew that voice, but he did not lower his wand
[8163]851   Professor Moody
[8164]5103  ' he said uncertainly
[8165]6543   I don't know so much about Professor",' growled the voice, never got round to much teaching, did I
[8166]359   Get down here, we want to see you properly
[8167]7701   'Harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it, nor did he move
[8168]402    He had very good reason to be suspicious
[8169]19200    He had recently spent nine months in what he had thought was Mad-Eye Moody's company only to find out that it wasn't Moody at all, but an impostor; an impostor, moreover, who It's all right, Harry
[8170]1473    We've come to take you away
[8171]10626   'Harry's heart leapt
[8172]3674    He knew that voice, too, though he hadn't heard it for over a year
[8173]936   P-Professor Lupin
[8174]5088  ' he said disbelievingly
[8175]0    Is that you
[8176]459  'Why are we all standing in the dark
[8177]10498  ' said a third voice, this one completely unfamiliar, a woman's
[8178]5    Lumos
[8179]900   'A wand-tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light
[8180]5746    Harry blinked
[8181]1246    The people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs, gazing up at him intently, some craning their heads for a better look
[8182]369   Remus Lupin stood nearest to him
[8183]12491    Though still quite young, Lupin looked tired and rather ill; he had more grey hairs than when Harry had last said good-bye to him and his robes were more patched and shabbier than ever
[8184]6095    Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry, who tried to smile back despite his state of shock
[8185]7731   Oooh, he looks just like I thought he would,' said the witch who was holding her lit wand aloft
[8186]2437    She looked the youngest there; she had a pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes, and short spiky hair that was a violent shade of violet
[8187]5735    Wotcher, Harry
[8188]6967  'Yeah, I see what you mean, Remus,' said a bald black wizard standing furthest back; he had a deep, slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear
[8189]1001    He looks exactly like James
[8190]5839   'Except the eyes,' said a wheezy-voiced, silver-haired wizard at the back
[8191]5241    Lily's eyes
[8192]7491   'Mad-Eye Moody, who had long grizzled grey hair and a large chunk missing from his nose, was squinting suspiciously at Harry through his mismatched eyes
[8193]6783    One eye was small, dark and beady, the other large, round and electric blue-the magical eye that could see through walls, doors, and the back of Moody's own head
[8194]5329   Are you quite sure it's him, Lupin
[8195]32  ' he growled
[8196]929    It'd be a nice lookout if we bring back some Death Eater impersonating him
[8197]1462    We ought to ask him something only the real Potter would know
[8198]82    Unless anyone brought any Veritaserum
[8199]5872  'Harry, what form does your Patronus take
[8200]520  ' Lupin asked
[8201]10869   A stag,' said Harry nervously
[8202]10241   That's him, Mad-Eye,' said Lupin
[8203]6738   Very conscious of everybody still staring at him, Harry descended the stairs, stowing his wand in the back pocket of his jeans as he came
[8204]3482   Don't put your wand there, boy
[8205]147  ' roared Moody
[8206]5    What if it ignited
[8207]1123   Better wizards than you have lost buttocks, you know
[8208]6205  'Who d'you know who's lost a buttock
[8209]692  ' the violet-haired woman asked Mad-Eye interestedly
[8210]1413   Never you mind, you just keep your wand out of your back pocket
[8211]273  ' growled Mad-Eye
[8212]420    Elementary wand-safety, nobody bothers about it any more
[8213]91   ' He stumped off towards the kitchen
[8214]1087    And I saw that,' he added irritably, as the woman rolled her eyes towards the ceiling
[8215]11129   Lupin held out his hand and shook Harry's
[8216]0   How are you
[8217]6749  ' he asked, looking closely at Harry
[8218]79   F-fine
[8219]0   
[8220]0   
[8221]5936   'Harry could hardly believe this was real
[8222]1332    Four weeks with nothing, not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from Privet Drive, and suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matter-of-factly in the house as though this was a long-standing arrangement
[8223]620    He glanced at the people surrounding Lupin; they were still gazing avidly at him
[8224]609    He felt very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his hair for four days
[8225]825   I'm-you're really lucky the Dursleys are out
[8226]0   
[8227]0   
[8228]23   ' he mumbled
[8229]53   Lucky, ha
[8230]5179  ' said the violet-haired woman
[8231]359    It was me who lured them out of the way
[8232]1307    Sent a letter by Muggle post telling them they'd been short-listed for the All-England Best Kept Suburban Lawn Competition
[8233]661    They're heading off to the prize-giving right now
[8234]0   
[8235]0   
[8236]0   
[8237]562    Or they think they are
[8238]11634   'Harry had a fleeting vision of Uncle Vernon's face when he realised there was no All-England Best Kept Suburban Lawn Competition
[8239]2428   We are leaving, aren't we
[8240]356  ' he asked
[8241]74    Soon
[8242]6206  'Almost at once,' said Lupin, we're just waiting for the all-clear
[8243]489   'Where are we going
[8244]13   The Burrow
[8245]6112  ' Harry asked hopefully
[8246]17372   Not The Burrow, no,' said Lupin, motioning Harry towards the kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry curiously
[8247]2    Too risky
[8248]849    We've set up Headquarters somewhere un-detectable
[8249]4829    It's taken a while
[8250]0   
[8251]0   
[8252]0   
[8253]1262   'Mad-Eye Moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging from a hip flask, his magical eye spinning in all directions, taking in the Dursleys' many labour-saving appliances
[8254]6288   This is Alastor Moody, Harry,' Lupin continued, pointing towards Moody
[8255]11877   Yeah, I know,' said Harry uncomfortably
[8256]2245    It felt odd to be introduced to somebody he'd thought he'd known for a year
[8257]13035   And this is Nymphadora-'Don't call me Nymphadora, Remus,' said the young witch with a shudder, it's Tonks
[8258]389   'Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by her surname only,' finished Lupin
[8259]430   So would you if your fool of a mother had called you Nymphadora,' muttered Tonks
[8260]1642   And this is Kingsley Shacklebolt'-he indicated the tall black wizard, who bowed-'Elphias Doge'-the wheezy-voiced wizard nodded-'Dedalus Diggle-'We've met before,' squeaked the excitable Diggle, dropping his violet-coloured top hat
[8261]1688   -Emmeline Vance'-a stately-looking witch in an emerald green shawl inclined her head-'Sturgis Podmore'-a square-jawed wizard with thick straw-coloured hair winked-'and Hestia Jones
[8262]424   ' A pink-cheeked, black-haired witch waved from next to the toaster
[8263]6242   Harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were introduced
[8264]600    He wished they would look at something other than him; it was as though he had suddenly been ushered on-stage
[8265]41    He also wondered why so many of them were there
[8266]17201   A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,' said Lupin, as though he had read Harry's mind; the corners of his mouth twitched slightly
[8267]5670   Yeah, well, the more the better,' said Moody darkly
[8268]492    We're your guard, Potter
[8269]11671   'We're just waiting for the signal to tell us it's safe to set off,' said Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen window
[8270]1495    We've got about fifteen minutes
[8271]2432   'Very clean, aren't they, these Muggles
[8272]6338  ' said the witch called Tonks, who was looking around the kitchen with great interest
[8273]10486    My dad's Muggle-born and he's a right old slob
[8274]1066    I suppose it varies, just as it does with wizards
[8275]11216  'Er-yeah,' said Harry
[8276]13656    Look'-he turned back to Lupin-'what's going on, I haven't heard anything from anyone, what's Vol-
[8277]647  'Several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises; Dedalus Diggle dropped his hat again, and Moody growled, Shut up
[8278]0  'What
[8279]10818  ' said Harry
[8280]15953   We're not discussing anything here, it's too risky,' said Moody, turning his normal eye on Harry
[8281]377    His magical eye remained focused on the ceiling
[8282]2231    Damn it,' he added angrily, putting a hand up to the magical eye, it keeps getting stuck-ever since that scum wore it-'And with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled from a sink, he popped out his eye
[8283]8713   Mad-Eye, you do know that's disgusting, don't you
[8284]5192  ' said Tonks conversationally
[8285]5975   Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry,' requested Moody
[8286]6446   Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean glass and filled it with water at the sink, still watched eagerly by the band of wizards
[8287]224    Their relentless staring was starting to annoy him
[8288]11063   Cheers,' said Moody, when Harry handed him the glass
[8289]629    He dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and down; the eye whizzed around, staring at them all in turn
[8290]420    I want three hundred and sixty degrees visibility on the return journey
[8291]602   'How're we getting-wherever we're going
[8292]6088  ' Harry asked
[8293]5269   Brooms,' said Lupin
[8294]355    Only way
[8295]10538    You're too young to Apparate, they'll be watching the Floo Network and it's more than our life's worth to set up an unauthorised Portkey
[8296]6203   'Remus says you're a good flier,' said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep voice
[8297]10136   He's excellent,' said Lupin, who was checking his watch
[8298]7001    Anyway, you'd better go and get packed, Harry, we want to be ready to go when the signal comes
[8299]6376   'I'll come and help you,' said Tonks brightly
[8300]6740   She followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs, looking around with much curiosity and interest
[8301]5322   Funny place,' she said
[8302]6590    It's a bit too clean, d'you know what I mean
[8303]198   Bit unnatural
[8304]11715    Oh, this is better,' she added, as they entered Harry's bedroom and he turned on the light
[8305]802   His room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house
[8306]5945    Confined to it for four days in a very bad mood, Harry had not bothered tidying up after himself
[8307]7301    Most of the books he owned were strewn over the floor where he'd tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it aside; Hedwig's cage needed cleaning out and was starting to smell; and his trunk lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle clothes and wizards' robes that had spilled on to the floor around it
[8308]6099   Harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his trunk
[8309]1583    Tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door
[8310]14619   You know, I don't think violet's really my colour,' she said pensively, tugging at a lock of spiky hair
[8311]1865    D'you think it makes me look a bit peaky
[8312]11707  'Er-' said Harry, looking up at her over the top of Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland
[8313]5557   Yeah, it does,' said Tonks decisively
[8314]706    She screwed up her eyes in a strained expression as though she was struggling to remember something
[8315]839    A second later, her hair had turned bubble-gum pink
[8316]667   How did you do that
[8317]11477  ' said Harry, gaping at her as she opened her eyes again
[8318]6900   I'm a Metamorphmagus,' she said, looking back at her reflection and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions
[8319]10781    It means I can change my appearance at will,' she added, spotting Harry's puzzled expression in the mirror behind her
[8320]32    I was born one
[8321]1041    I got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training without any study at all, it was great
[8322]20   'You're an Auror
[8323]10832  ' said Harry, impressed
[8324]1348    Being a Dark-wizard-catcher was the only career he'd ever considered after Hogwarts
[8325]6084   Yeah,' said Tonks, looking proud
[8326]5010    Kingsley is as well; he's a bit higher up than me, though
[8327]261    I only qualified a year ago
[8328]136    Nearly failed on Stealth and Tracking
[8329]1556    I'm dead clumsy, did you hear me break that plate when we arrived downstairs
[8330]27  'Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus
[8331]6170  ' Harry asked her, straightening up, completely forgetting about packing
[8332]109   Tonks chuckled
[8333]2765   Bet you wouldn't mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh
[8334]11123  'Her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry's forehead
[8335]8759   No, I wouldn't mind,' Harry mumbled, turning away
[8336]1980    He did not like people staring at his scar
[8337]6787   Well, you'll have to learn the hard way, I'm afraid,' said Tonks
[8338]327    Metamorphmagi are really rare, they're born, not made
[8339]901    Most wizards need to use a wand, or potions, to change their appearance
[8340]8688    But we've got to get going, Harry, we're supposed to be packing,' she added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the floor
[8341]11547   Oh-yeah,' said Harry, grabbing a few more books
[8342]3594   Don't be stupid, it'll be much quicker if I-pack
[8343]1256  ' cried Tonks, waving her wand in a long, sweeping movement over the floor
[8344]432   Books, clothes, telescope, and scales all soared into the air and flew pell-mell into the trunk
[8345]10881   It's not very neat,' said Tonks, walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside
[8346]11852    My mum's got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatly-she even gets the socks to fold themselves-but I've never mastered how she does it-it's a kind of flick-' She flicked her wand hopefully
[8347]10894   One of Harry's socks gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess in the trunk
[8348]14927   Ah, well,' said Tonks, slamming the trunk's lid shut, at least it's all in
[8349]209    That could do with a bit of cleaning, too
[8350]5362   ' She pointed her wand at Hedwig's cage
[8351]3    Scourgify
[8352]83   ' A few feathers and droppings vanished
[8353]6837    Well, that's a bit better- I've never quite got the hang of these householdy sort of spells
[8354]1247    Right-got everything
[8355]42   Cauldron
[8356]57   Broom
[8357]9   Wow
[8358]13   A Firebolt
[8359]12054  'Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harry's right hand
[8360]740    It was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international-standard broomstick
[8361]5638   And I'm still riding a Comet Two Sixty,' said Tonks enviously
[8362]51    Ah well 
[8363]0   
[8364]0   
[8365]422    wand still in your jeans
[8366]2   Both buttocks still on
[8367]5152   OK, let's go
[8368]71    Locomotor trunk
[8369]10783   'Harry's trunk rose a few inches into the air
[8370]7907    Holding her wand like a conductors baton, Tonks made the trunk hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them, Hedwig's cage in her left hand
[8371]6011    Harry followed her down the stairs carrying his broomstick
[8372]6818   Back in the kitchen Moody had replaced his eye, which was spinning so fast after its cleaning it made Harry feel sick to look at it
[8373]628    Kingsley Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore were examining the microwave and Hestia Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while rummaging in the drawers
[8374]342    Lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the Dursleys
[8375]11803   Excellent,' said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered
[8376]1983    We've got about a minute, I think
[8377]169    We should probably get out into the garden so we're ready
[8378]20454    Harry, I've left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry-'They won't,' said Harry
[8379]1407   -that you're safe-'That'll just depress them
[8380]631   '-and you'll see them next summer
[8381]0   'Do I have to
[8382]272  'Lupin smiled but made no answer
[8383]11910   Come here, boy,' said Moody gruffly, beckoning Harry towards him with his wand
[8384]184    I need to Disillusion you
[8385]183   'You need to what
[8386]10859  ' said Harry nervously
[8387]5679   Disillusionment Charm,' said Moody, raising his wand
[8388]5102    Lupin says you've got an Invisibility Cloak, but it won't stay on while we're flying; this'll disguise you better
[8389]8423    Here you go-'He rapped him hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a curious sensation as though Moody had just smashed an egg there; cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck
[8390]16150   Nice one, Mad-Eye,' said Tonks appreciatively, staring at Harry's midriff
[8391]10451   Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body, for it didn't look anything like his any more
[8392]251    It was not invisible; it had simply taken on the exact colour and texture of the kitchen unit behind him
[8393]39    He seemed to have become a human chameleon
[8394]6532   Come on,' said Moody, unlocking the back door with his wand
[8395]5393   They all stepped outside on to Uncle Vernon's beautifully kept lawn
[8396]646   Clear night,' grunted Moody, his magical eye scanning the heavens
[8397]940    Could've done with a bit more cloud cover
[8398]6965    Right, you,' he barked at Harry, we're going to be flying in close formation
[8399]1356    Tonks'll be right in front of you, keep close on her tail
[8400]745    Lupin'll be covering you from below
[8401]930    I'm going to be behind you
[8402]682    The rest'll be circling us
[8403]3673    We don't break ranks for anything, got me
[8404]56   If one of us is killed-'Is that likely
[8405]6219  ' Harry asked apprehensively, but Moody ignored him
[8406]6128   -the others keep flying, don't stop, don't break ranks
[8407]6604    If they take out all of us and you survive, Harry, the rear guard are standing by to take over; keep flying east and they'll join you
[8408]22391   'Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he'll think we're not taking this seriously,' said Tonks, as she strapped Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage into a harness hanging from her broom
[8409]1633   I'm just telling the boy the plan,' growled Moody
[8410]15917    Our job's to deliver him safely to Headquarters and if we die in the attempt-'No one's going to die,' said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep, calming voice
[8411]4784   Mount your brooms, that's the first signal
[8412]5448  ' said Lupin sharply, pointing into the sky
[8413]464   Far, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks had flared among the stars
[8414]6178    Harry recognised them at once as wand sparks
[8415]1335    He swung his right leg over his Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly and felt it vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he was to be up in the air once more
[8416]5241   Second signal, let's go
[8417]6163  ' said Lupin loudly as more sparks, green this time, exploded high above them
[8418]6043   Harry kicked off hard from the ground
[8419]3027    The cool night air rushed through his hair as the neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away, shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his mind as though the rush of air had blown it out of his head
[8420]2696    He felt as though his heart was going to explode with pleasure; he was flying again, flying away from Privet Drive as he'd been fantasising about all summer, he was going home
[8421]0   
[8422]0   
[8423]0   
[8424]103    For a few glorious moments, all his problems seemed to recede to nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky
[8425]6346   Hard left, hard left, there's a Muggle looking up
[8426]235  ' shouted Moody from behind him
[8427]6320    Tonks swerved and Harry followed her, watching his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom
[8428]198    We need more height
[8429]0   
[8430]0   
[8431]0   
[8432]10    Give it another quarter of a mile
[8433]11366  'Harry's eyes watered in the chill as they soared upwards: he could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps
[8434]5276    Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Vernon's car
[8435]0   
[8436]0   
[8437]0   
[8438]936    The Dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now, full of rage about the nonexistent Lawn Competition 
[8439]0   
[8440]0   
[8441]7407    and Harry laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was drowned by the flapping robes of the others, the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage, and the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air
[8442]414    He had not felt this alive in a month, or this happy
[8443]16   Bearing south
[8444]376  ' shouted Mad-Eye
[8445]57    Town ahead
[8446]705  'They soared right to avoid passing directly over the glittering spiderweb of lights below
[8447]4943   Bear southeast and keep climbing, there's some low cloud ahead we can lose ourselves in
[8448]219  ' called Moody
[8449]503   We're not going through clouds
[8450]1133  ' shouted Tonks angrily, we'll get soaked, Mad-Eye
[8451]11215  'Harry was relieved to hear her say this; his hands were growing numb on the Firebolt's handle
[8452]458    He wished he had thought to put on a coat; he was starting to shiver
[8453]5238   They altered their course every now and then according to Mad-Eye's instructions
[8454]12321    Harry's eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that was starting to make his ears ache; he could remember being this cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff in his third year, which had taken place in a storm
[8455]841    The guard around him was circling continuously like giant birds of prey
[8456]6357    Harry lost track of time
[8457]1555    He wondered how long they had been flying, it felt like an hour at least
[8458]89   Turning southwest
[8459]179  ' yelled Moody
[8460]358    We want to avoid the motorway
[8461]6316  'Harry was now so chilled he thought longingly of the snug, dry interiors of the cars streaming along below, then, even more longingly, of travelling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames
[8462]0   
[8463]0   
[8464]0   
[8465]294    Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around him, bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight
[8466]0   
[8467]0   
[8468]0   
[8469]2382    Now Emmeline Vance was on his right, her wand out, her head turning left and right 
[8470]0   
[8471]0   
[8472]72    then she, too, swooped over him, to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore
[8473]0   
[8474]0   
[8475]0   
[8476]1650   We ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure we're not being followed
[8477]235  ' Moody shouted
[8478]328   ARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE
[8479]139  ' Tonks screamed from the front
[8480]31    We're all frozen to our brooms
[8481]1250   If we keep going off-course we're not going to get there until next week
[8482]119   Besides, we're nearly there now
[8483]632  'Time to start the descent
[8484]5675  ' came Lupin's voice
[8485]5869    Follow Tonks, Harry
[8486]5964  'Harry followed Tonks into a dive
[8487]601    They were heading for the largest collection of lights he had yet seen, a huge, sprawling crisscrossing mass, glittering in lines and grids, interspersed with patches of deepest black
[8488]5869    Lower and lower they flew, until Harry could see individual headlights and streetlamps, chimneys and television aerials
[8489]880    He wanted to reach the ground very much, though he felt sure someone would have to unfreeze him from his broom
[8490]0   Here we go
[8491]455  ' called Tonks, and a few seconds later she had landed
[8492]6611   Harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square
[8493]10655    Tonks was already unbuckling Harry's trunk
[8494]6423    Shivering, Harry looked around
[8495]749    The grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them had broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the streetlamps, paint was peeling from many of the doors and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front steps
[8496]0   Where are we
[8497]11513  ' Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, In a minute
[8498]479   'Moody was rummaging in his cloak, his gnarled hands clumsy with cold
[8499]2521   Got it,' he muttered, raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking it
[8500]242   The nearest streetlamp went out with a pop
[8501]905    He clicked the unlighter again; the next lamp went out; he kept clicking until every lamp in the square was extinguished and the only remaining light came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead
[8502]958   Borrowed it from Dumbledore,' growled Moody, pocketing the Put-Outer
[8503]1458    That'll take care of any Muggles looking out of the window, see
[8504]477   Now come on, quick
[8505]17373   'He took Harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass, across the road and on to the pavement; Lupin and Tonks followed, carrying Harry's trunk between them, the rest of the guard, all with their wands out, flanking them
[8506]565   The muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest house
[8507]1422    A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging bin-bags just inside the broken gate
[8508]11893   Here,' Moody muttered, thrusting a piece of parchment towards Harry's Disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it, so as to illuminate the writing
[8509]284    Read quickly and memorise
[8510]6490   'Harry looked down at the piece of paper
[8511]73    The narrow handwriting was vaguely familiar
[8512]5644    It said:The Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London

[8530]4902     What's the Order of the-
[8531]5853  ' Harry began
[8532]132   Not here, boy
[8533]137  ' snarled Moody
[8534]295    Wait till we're inside
[8535]11743  'He pulled the piece of parchment out of Harry's hand and set fire to it with his wand-tip
[8536]6641    As the message curled into flames and floated to the ground, Harry looked around at the houses again
[8537]2334    They were standing outside number eleven; he looked to the left and saw number ten; to the right, however, was number thirteen
[8538]4750   But where's-
[8539]7451  'Think about what you've just memorised,' said Lupin quietly
[8540]7415   Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about number twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows
[8541]612    It was as though an extra house had inflated, pushing those on either side out of its way
[8542]5740    Harry gaped at it
[8543]80    The stereo in number eleven thudded on
[8544]2993    Apparently the Muggles inside hadn't felt anything
[8545]6348   Come on, hurry,' growled Moody, prodding Harry in the back
[8546]6761   Harry walked up the worn stone steps, staring at the newly materialised door
[8547]265    Its black paint was shabby and scratched
[8548]158    The silver doorknocker was in the form of a twisted serpent
[8549]6    There was no keyhole or letterbox
[8550]1257   Lupin, pulled out his wand and tapped the door once
[8551]6897    Harry heard many loud, metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a chain
[8552]753    The door creaked open
[8553]12312   Get in quick, Harry,' Lupin whispered, but don't go far inside and don't touch anything
[8554]6060   'Harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of the hall
[8555]457    He could smell damp, dust, and a sweetish, rotting smell; the place had the feeling of a derelict building
[8556]6387    He looked over his shoulder and saw the others filing in behind him, Lupin and Tonks carrying his trunk and Hedwig's cage
[8557]1897    Moody was standing on the top step releasing the balls of light the Put-Outer had stolen from the streetlamps; they flew back to their bulbs and the square glowed momentarily with orange light before Moody limped inside and closed the front door, so that the darkness in the hall became complete
[8558]13787   Here-'He rapped Harry hard over the head with his wand; Harry felt as though something hot was trickling down his back this time and knew that the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted
[8559]628   Now stay still, everyone, while I give us a bit of light in here,' Moody whispered
[8560]7283   The others' hushed voices were giving Harry an odd feeling of foreboding; it was as though they had just entered the house of a dying person
[8561]1514    He heard a soft hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas lamps sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a flickering insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls
[8562]6032    Harry heard something scuttling behind the skirting board
[8563]1003    Both the chandelier and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents
[8564]7329   There were hurried footsteps and Ron's mother, Mrs
[8565]1732    Weasley, emerged from a door at the far end of the hall
[8566]6693    She was beaming in welcome as she hurried towards them, though Harry noticed that she was rather thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen her
[8567]10859   Oh, Harry, it's lovely to see you
[8568]5196  ' she whispered, pulling him into a rib-cracking hug before holding him at arm's length and examining him critically
[8569]2178    You're looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you'll have to wait a bit for dinner, I'm afraid
[8570]0   
[8571]0   
[8572]0   
[8573]11158   'She turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered urgently, He's just arrived, the meeting's started
[8574]7034   'The wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest and excitement and began filing past him towards the door through which Mrs
[8575]1880    Weasley had just come
[8576]6299    Harry made to follow Lupin, but Mrs
[8577]697    Weasley held him back
[8578]10735   No, Harry, the meeting's only for members of the Order
[8579]4388    Ron and Hermione are upstairs, you can wait with them until the meetings over, then we'll have dinner
[8580]878    And keep your voice down in the hall,' she added in an urgent whisper
[8581]0   Why
[8582]3308  'I don't want anything to wake up
[8583]621   'What d'you-
[8584]4140  'I'll explain later, I've got to hurry, I'm supposed to be at the meeting- I'll just show you where you're sleeping
[8585]13578   'Pressing her finger to her lips, she led him on tiptoe past a pair of long, moth-eaten curtains, behind which Harry supposed there must be another door, and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked as though it had been made from a severed troll's leg, they started up the dark staircase, passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall
[8586]6554    A closer look showed Harry that the heads belonged to house-elves
[8587]852    All of them had the same rather snout-like nose
[8588]10737   Harry's bewilderment deepened with every step he took
[8589]1222    What on earth were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to the Darkest of wizards
[8590]369  Mrs
[8591]636    Weasley, why-
[8592]5786  'Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I've really got to dash,' Mrs
[8593]768    Weasley whispered distractedly
[8594]1377    There'-they had reached the second landing-'you're the door on the right
[8595]5317    I'll call you when it's over
[8596]106   'And she hurried off downstairs again
[8597]12870   Harry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom doorknob, which was shaped like a serpent's head, and opened the door
[8598]10650   He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded room; then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even louder shriek, and his vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair- Hermione had thrown herself on to him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat, while Ron's tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, zoomed excitedly round and round their heads
[8599]5732   HARRY
[8600]17234   Ron, he's here, Harry's here
[8601]2905   We didn't hear you arrive
[8602]362   Oh, how are you
[8603]557   Are you all right
[8604]27   Have you been furious with us
[8605]10896   I bet you have, I know our letters were useless-but we couldn't tell you anything, Dumbledore made us swear we wouldn't, oh, we've got so much to tell you, and you've got things to tell us-the dementors
[8606]33553   When we heard-and that Ministry hearing-it's just outrageous, I've looked it all up, they can't expel you, they just can't, there's provision in the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of magic in life-threatening situations-'Let him breathe, Hermione,' said Ron, grinning as he closed the door behind Harry
[8607]1619    He seemed to have grown several more inches during their month apart, making him taller and more gangly looking than ever, though the long nose, bright red hair and freckles were the same
[8608]19280   Still beaming, Hermione let go of Harry, but before she could say another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on Harry's shoulder
[8609]84   Hedwig
[8610]5964  'The snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately as Harry stroked her feathers
[8611]12412   She's been in a right state,' said Ron
[8612]7949    Pecked us half to death when she brought your last letters, look at this-'He showed Harry the index finger of his right hand, which sported a half-healed but clearly deep cut
[8613]11457   Oh, yeah,' Harry said
[8614]1049    Sorry about that, but I wanted answers, you know
[8615]0   
[8616]0   
[8617]0   
[8618]7282   'We wanted to give them to you, mate,' said Ron
[8619]15101    Hermione was going spare, she kept saying you'd do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news, but Dumbledore made us-'-swear not to tell me,' said Harry
[8620]11728    Yeah, Hermione's already said
[8621]597   'The warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two best friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his stomach
[8622]4262    All of a sudden-after yearning to see them for a solid month-he felt he would rather Ron and Hermione left him alone
[8623]6529   There was a strained silence in which Harry stroked Hedwig automatically, not looking at either of the others
[8624]7371   He seemed to think it was best,' said Hermione rather breathlessly
[8625]1048    Dumbledore, I mean
[8626]11375   'Right,' said Harry
[8627]5221    He noticed that her hands, too, bore the marks of Hedwig's beak and found that he was not at all sorry
[8628]3123   I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles-' Ron began
[8629]277   Yeah
[8630]10894  ' said Harry, raising his eyebrows
[8631]205    Have either of you been attacked by dementors this summer
[8632]18274  'Well, no-but that's why he's had people from the Order of the Phoenix tailing you all the time-'Harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a step going downstairs
[8633]163    So everyone had known he was being followed, except him
[8634]3478   Didn't work that well, though, did it
[8635]11543  ' said Harry, doing his utmost to keep his voice even
[8636]3165    Had to look after myself after all, didn't I
[8637]7313  'He was so angry,' said Hermione, in an almost awestruck voice
[8638]817    Dumbledore
[8639]326    We saw him
[8640]360    When he found out Mundungus had left before his shift had ended
[8641]3    He was scary
[8642]11593   'Well, I'm glad he left,' Harry said coldly
[8643]6334    If he hadn't, I wouldn't have done magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at Privet Drive all summer
[8644]2361   'Aren't you 
[8645]0   
[8646]0   
[8647]2903    aren't you worried about the Ministry of Magic hearing
[8648]6838  ' said Hermione quietly
[8649]5749   No,' Harry lied defiantly
[8650]1796    He walked away from them, looking around, with Hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder, but this room was not likely to raise his spirits
[8651]312    It was dank and dark
[8652]6824    A blank stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the bareness of the peeling walls, and as Harry passed it he thought he heard someone who was lurking out of sight snigger
[8653]5898   So why's Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark
[8654]7037  ' Harry asked, still trying hard to keep his voice casual
[8655]914    Did you-er-bother to ask him at all
[8656]3022  'He glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told him he was behaving just as they had feared he would
[8657]706    It did nothing to improve his temper
[8658]9221   We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on,' said Ron
[8659]688    We did, mate
[8660]28376    But he's really busy now, we've only seen him twice since we came here and he didn't have much time, he just made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote, he said the owls might be intercepted-'He could still've kept me informed if he'd wanted to,' Harry said shortly
[8661]3377    You're not telling me he doesn't know ways to send messages without owls
[8662]9150   'Hermione glanced at Ron and then said, I thought that, too
[8663]3814    But he didn't want you to know anything
[8664]13399   'Maybe he thinks I can't be trusted,' said Harry, watching their expressions
[8665]10671   Don't be thick,' said Ron, looking highly disconcerted
[8666]2385   Or that I can't take care of myself
[8667]3196   'Of course he doesn't think that
[8668]6736  ' said Hermione anxiously
[8669]5855   So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys' while you two get to join in everything that's going on here
[8670]11641  ' said Harry, the words tumbling over one another in a rush, his voice growing louder with every word
[8671]6492    How come you two are allowed to know everything that's going on
[8672]0  'We're not
[8673]2023  ' Ron interrupted
[8674]9081    Mum won't let us near the meetings, she says we're too young-'But before he knew it, Harry was shouting
[8675]2559   SO YOU HAVEN'T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG DEAL
[8676]3131   YOU'VE STILL BEEN HERE, HAVEN'T YOU
[8677]693   YOU'VE STILL BEEN TOGETHER
[8678]837   ME, I'VE BEEN STUCK AT THE DURSLEYS' FOR A MONTH
[8679]7228   AND I'VE HANDLED MORE THAN YOU TWO'VE EVER MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE KNOWS IT- WHO SAVED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
[8680]856   WHO GOT RID OF RIDDLE
[8681]114   WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS
[8682]7268  'Every bitter and resentful thought Harry had had in the past month was pouring out of him: his frustration at the lack of news, the hurt that they had all been together without him, his fury at being followed and not told about it: All the feelings he was half-ashamed of finally burst their boundaries
[8683]544    Hedwig took fright at the noise and soared off to the top of the wardrobe again; Pigwidgeon twittered in alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads
[8684]547   WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR
[8685]762   WHO SAW HIM> COME BACK
[8686]29   WHO HAD TO ESCAPE FROM HIM
[8687]0   ME
[8688]5464  'Ron was standing there with his mouth half-open, clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say, whilst Hermione looked on the verge of tears
[8689]6010   BUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
[8690]5132   WHY SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO TELL ME WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING
[8691]8928  'Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did-' Hermione began
[8692]21361   CAN'T'VE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR YOU'D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT DUMBLEDORE MADE YOU SWEAR-'Well, he did-'FOUR WEEKS I'VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON-'We wanted to-I SUPPOSE YOU'VE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH, HAVEN'T YOU, ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER-'No, honest-'Harry, we're really sorry
[8693]7263  ' said Hermione desperately, her eyes now sparkling with tears
[8694]6958    You're absolutely right, Harry- I'd be furious if it was me
[8695]6504  'Harry glared at her, still breathing deeply, then turned away from them again, pacing up and down
[8696]108    Hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the wardrobe
[8697]11154    There was a long pause, broken only by the mournful creak of the floorboards below Harry's feet
[8698]183   What is this place, anyway
[8699]3665  ' he shot at Ron and Hermione
[8700]7334   Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,' said Ron at once
[8701]823   Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the Phoenix-
[8702]11649  'It's a secret society,' said Hermione quickly
[8703]5583    Dumbledore's in charge, he founded it
[8704]6408    It's the people who fought against You-Know-Who last time
[8705]4750   'Who's in it
[8706]11138  ' said Harry coming to a halt with his hands in his pockets
[8707]8907   Quite a few people-'We've met about twenty of them,' said Ron, but we think there are more
[8708]5760   'Harry glared at them
[8709]0   Well
[8710]634  ' he demanded, looking from one to the other
[8711]7209   Er,' said Ron
[8712]0    Well what
[8713]233  'Voldemort
[8714]14490  ' said Harry furiously, and both Ron and Hermione winced
[8715]4784    What's happening
[8716]4750   What's he up to
[8717]0   Where is he
[8718]315   What are we doing to stop him
[8719]11193  'We've told you, the Order don't let us in on their meetings,' said Hermione nervously
[8720]16870    So we don't know the details-but we've got a general idea-' she added hastily, seeing the look on Harry's face
[8721]8004   Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears, see,' said Ron
[8722]308    They're really useful
[8723]18   'Extendable-
[8724]367  'Ears, yeah
[8725]1146    Only we've had to stop using them lately because Mum found out and went berserk
[8726]1035    Fred and George had to hide them all to stop Mum binning them
[8727]1947    But we got a good bit of use out of them before Mum realised what was going on
[8728]9272    We know some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping tabs on them, you know-'-some of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order-' said Hermione
[8729]7268   -and some of them are standing guard over something,' said Ron
[8730]188    They're always talking about guard duty
[8731]2437   'Couldn't have been me, could it
[8732]10824  ' said Harry sarcastically
[8733]8192   Oh, yeah,' said Ron, with a look of dawning comprehension
[8734]5742   Harry snorted
[8735]4823    He walked around the room again, looking anywhere but at Ron and Hermione
[8736]251    So, what have you two been doing, if you're not allowed in meetings
[8737]29  ' he demanded
[8738]5743    You said you'd been busy
[8739]6856   'We have,' said Hermione quickly
[8740]10494    We've been decontaminating this house, it's been empty for ages and stuff's been breeding in here
[8741]2090    We've managed to clean out the kitchen, most of the bedrooms and I think we're doing the drawing room tomo-AARGH
[8742]8338  'With two loud cracks, Fred and George, Ron's elder twin brothers, had materialised out of thin air in the middle of the room
[8743]202    Pigwidgeon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join Hedwig on top of the wardrobe
[8744]315   Stop doing that
[8745]9040  ' Hermione said weakly to the twins, who were as vividly red-haired as Ron, though stockier and slightly shorter
[8746]11273   Hello, Harry' said George, beaming at him
[8747]671    We thought we heard your dulcet tones
[8748]15691   'You don't want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all out,' said Fred, also beaming
[8749]3665    There might be a couple of people fifty miles away who didn't hear you
[8750]123   'You two passed your Apparation tests, then
[8751]6092  ' asked Harry grumpily
[8752]7440   With distinction,' said Fred, who was holding what looked like a piece of very long, flesh-coloured string
[8753]7444   It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs,' said Ron
[8754]6405   Time is Galleons, little brother,' said Fred
[8755]5738    Anyway, Harry, you're interfering with reception
[8756]17022    Extendable Ears,' he added in response to Harry's raised eyebrows, and held up the string which Harry now saw was trailing out on to the landing
[8757]5692    We're trying to hear what's going on downstairs
[8758]7774   'You want to be careful,' said Ron, staring at the Ear, if Mum sees one of them again
[8759]0   
[8760]0   
[8761]15234   'It's worth the risk, that's a major meeting they're having,' said Fred
[8762]1374   The door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared
[8763]6130   Oh, hello, Harry
[8764]12231  ' said Ron's younger sister, Ginny, brightly
[8765]1198    I thought I heard your voice
[8766]16351   'Turning to Fred and George, she said, It's no-go with the Extendable Ears, she's gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen door
[8767]1392   'How d'you know
[8768]6072  ' said George, looking crestfallen
[8769]5847   Tonks told me how to find out,' said Ginny
[8770]9169    You just chuck stuff at the door and if it can't make contact the door's been Imperturbed
[8771]7287    I've been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from it, so there's no way the Extendable Ears will be able to get under the gap
[8772]534   'Fred heaved a deep sigh
[8773]11   Shame
[8774]5733    I really fancied finding out what old Snape's been up to
[8775]480   'Snape
[8776]10973  ' said Harry quickly
[8777]0    Is he here
[8778]7348  'Yeah,' said George, carefully closing the door and sitting down on one of the beds; Fred and Ginny followed
[8779]92    Giving a report
[8780]37    Top secret
[8781]5526   'Git,' said Fred idly
[8782]11454   He's on our side now,' said Hermione reprovingly
[8783]2012   Ron snorted
[8784]2557    Doesn't stop him being a git
[8785]447    The way he looks at us when he sees us
[8786]0   
[8787]0   
[8788]0   
[8789]8684   'Bill doesn't like him, either,' said Ginny, as though that settled the matter
[8790]6077   Harry was not sure his anger had abated yet; but his thirst for information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting
[8791]270    He sank on to the bed opposite the others
[8792]0   Is Bill here
[8793]356  ' he asked
[8794]425    I thought he was working in Egypt
[8795]6473  'He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the Order,' said Fred
[8796]101    He says he misses the tombs, but,' he smirked, there are compensations
[8797]0   
[8798]0   
[8799]0   
[8800]852   'What d'you mean
[8801]297  'Remember old Fleur Delacour
[8802]5464  ' said George
[8803]11050    She's got a job at Gringotts to eemprove er Eeenglish-'-and Bill's been giving her a lot of private lessons,' sniggered Fred
[8804]15127   Charlie's in the Order, too,' said George, but he's still in Romania
[8805]6307    Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so Charlie's trying to make contacts on his days off
[8806]2561   'Couldn't Percy do that
[8807]6088  ' Harry asked
[8808]1601    The last he had heard, the third Weasley brother was working in the Department of International Magical Co-operation at the Ministry of Magic
[8809]12393   At Harry's words, all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly significant looks
[8810]11900   Whatever you do, don't mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,' Ron told Harry in a tense voice
[8811]0   Why not
[8812]20767  'Because every time Percy's name's mentioned, Dad breaks whatever he's holding and Mum starts crying,' Fred said
[8813]10202   It's been awful,' said Ginny sadly
[8814]7093   I think we're well shot of him,' said George, with an uncharacteristically ugly look on his face
[8815]4893   What's happened
[8816]10818  ' Harry said
[8817]5792   Percy and Dad had a row,' said Fred
[8818]1764    I've never seen Dad row with anyone like that
[8819]4846    It's normally Mum who shouts
[8820]0   
[8821]0   
[8822]0   
[8823]7203   'It was the first week back after term ended,' said Ron
[8824]625    We were about to come and join the Order
[8825]1369    Percy came home and told us he'd been promoted
[8826]5   'You're kidding
[8827]10818  ' said Harry
[8828]11845   Though he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious, Harry's impression was that Percy had not made a great success of his first job at the Ministry of Magic
[8829]1724    Percy had committed the fairly large oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by Lord Voldemort (not that the Ministry had believed it-they all thought Mr
[8830]224    Crouch had gone mad)
[8831]6694   Yeah, we were all surprised,' said George, because Percy got into a load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything
[8832]5346    They said Percy ought to have realised Crouch was off his rocker and informed a superior
[8833]4135    But you know Percy, Crouch left him in charge, he wasn't going to complain
[8834]0   
[8835]0   
[8836]0   
[8837]438   'So how come they promoted him
[8838]18421  'That's exactly what we wondered,' said Ron, who seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped yelling
[8839]7033    He came home really pleased with himself-even more pleased than usual, if you can imagine that-and told Dad he'd been offered a position in Fudge's own office
[8840]1125    A really good one for someone only a year out of Hogwarts-Junior Assistant to the Minister
[8841]726    He expected Dad to be all impressed, I think
[8842]8102   'Only Dad wasn't,' said Fred grimly
[8843]0   Why not
[8844]10818  ' said Harry
[8845]11782   Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry checking that nobody's having any contact with Dumbledore,' said George
[8846]11390   Dumbledore's name is mud with the Ministry these days, see,' said Fred
[8847]11919    They all think he's just making trouble saying You-Know-Who's back
[8848]11580   'Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who's in league with Dumbledore can clear out their desks,' said George
[8849]16316   Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he's friendly with Dumbledore, and he's always thought Dad's a bit of a weirdo because of his Muggle obsession
[8850]5564   'But what's that got to do with Percy
[8851]6112  ' asked Harry, confused
[8852]547   I'm coming to that
[8853]1688    Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his office because he wants to use him to spy on the family-and Dumbledore
[8854]6158   'Harry let out a low whistle
[8855]172   Bet Percy loved that
[8856]2505   'Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way
[8857]262   He went completely berserk
[8858]10310    He said-well, he said loads of terrible stuff
[8859]27184    He said he's been having to struggle against Dad's lousy reputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that Dad's got no ambition and that's why we've always been-you know-not had a lot of money, I mean-'What
[8860]12070  ' said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a noise like an angry cat
[8861]8485   I know,' said Ron in a low voice
[8862]746    And it got worse
[8863]8374    He said Dad was an idiot to run around with Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and that he-Percy-knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the Ministry
[8864]4900    And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the Ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he didn't belong to our family any more
[8865]505    And he packed his bags the same night and left
[8866]4796    He's living here in London now
[8867]5827   'Harry swore under his breath
[8868]7702    He had always liked Percy least of Ron's brothers, but he had never imagined he would say such things to Mr
[8869]636    Weasley
[8870]12513   Mum's been in a right state,' said Ron dully
[8871]866    You know-crying and stuff
[8872]1619    She came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed the door in her face
[8873]5109    I dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work-ignores him, I s'pose
[8874]16822   'But Percy must know Voldemort's back,' said Harry slowly
[8875]22568    He's not stupid, he must know your mum and dad wouldn't risk everything without proof-'Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,' said Ron, shooting Harry a furtive look
[8876]5306    Percy said the only evidence was your word and 
[8877]0   
[8878]0   
[8879]44    I dunno 
[8880]0   
[8881]0   
[8882]3613    he didn't think it was good enough
[8883]7045   'Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously,' said Hermione tartly, and the others all nodded
[8884]144   What are you talking about
[8885]6693  ' Harry asked, looking around at them all
[8886]5    They were all regarding him warily
[8887]5103   Haven't-haven't you been getting the Daily Prophet
[8888]2012  ' Hermione asked nervously
[8889]277   Yeah, I have
[8890]10818  ' said Harry
[8891]203   Have you-er- been reading it thoroughly
[8892]2006  ' Hermione asked, still more anxiously
[8893]10900   Not cover to cover,' said Harry defensively
[8894]3226    If they were going to report anything about Voldemort it would be headline news, wouldn't it
[8895]106  'The others flinched at the sound of the name
[8896]2945    Hermione hurried on, Well, you'd need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but they-um-they mention you a couple of times a week
[8897]11306   'But I'd have seen-'Not if you've only been reading the front page, you wouldn't,' said Hermione, shaking her head
[8898]647    I'm not talking about big articles
[8899]1737    They just slip you in, like you're a standing joke
[8900]621   'What d'you-
[8901]12328  'It's quite nasty, actually,' said Hermione in a voice of forced calm
[8902]5673    They're just building on Rita's stuff
[8903]4798   'But she's not writing for them any more, is she
[8904]12434  'Oh, no, she's kept her promise-not that she's got any choice,' Hermione added with satisfaction
[8905]253    But she laid the foundation for what they're trying to do now
[8906]0   'Which is what
[8907]10863  ' said Harry impatiently
[8908]1262   OK, you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar was hurting and all that
[8909]15974  'Yeah,' said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita Skeeter's stories about him in a hurry
[8910]18139   Well, they're writing about you as though you're this deluded, attention-seeking person who thinks he's a great tragic hero or something,' said Hermione, very fast, as though it would be less unpleasant for Harry to hear these facts quickly
[8911]21    They keep slipping in snide comments about you
[8912]30614    If some far-fetched story appears, they say something like, A tale worthy of Harry Potter", and if anyone has a funny accident or anything it's, Let's hope he hasn't got a scar on his forehead or we'll be asked to worship him next"-'I don't want anyone to worship-' Harry began hotly
[8913]11200   I know you don't,' said Hermione quickly, looking frightened
[8914]6503    I know, Harry
[8915]182    But you see what they're doing
[8916]506   They want to turn you into someone nobody will believe
[8917]805    Fudge is behind it, I'll bet anything
[8918]7640    They want wizards on the street to think you're just some stupid boy who's a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous tall stories because he loves being famous and wants to keep it going
[8919]6188   'I didn't ask- I didn't want- Voldemort killed my parents
[8920]5737  ' Harry spluttered
[8921]3325    I got famous because he murdered my family but couldn't kill me
[8922]63   Who wants to be famous for that
[8923]16679   Don't they think I'd rather it'd never-'We know, Harry,' said Ginny earnestly
[8924]9827   And of course, they didn't report a word about the dementors attacking you,' said Hermione
[8925]5113    Someone's told them to keep that quiet
[8926]1217    That should've been a really big story, out-of-control dementors
[8927]2535    They haven't even reported that you broke the International Statute of Secrecy
[8928]466    We thought they would, it would be in so well with this image of you as some stupid show-off
[8929]2502    We think they're biding their time until you're expelled, then they're really going to go to town- I mean, if you're expelled, obviously,' she went on hastily
[8930]7439    You really shouldn't be, not if they abide by their own laws, there's no case against you
[8931]7359   'They were back on the hearing and Harry did not want to think about that
[8932]479    He cast around for another change of subject, but was saved the necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs
[8933]367   Uh oh
[8934]1307   'Fred gave the Extendable Ear a hearty tug; there was another loud crack and he and George vanished
[8935]566    Seconds later, Mrs
[8936]798    Weasley appeared in the bedroom doorway
[8937]5316   The meeting's over, you can come down and have dinner now
[8938]10499    Everyone's dying to see you, Harry
[8939]5745    And who's left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen door
[8940]5453  'Crookshanks,' said Ginny unblushingly
[8941]44    He loves playing with them
[8942]8079   'Oh,' said Mrs Weasley, I thought it might have been Kreacher, he keeps doing odd things like that
[8943]3211    Now don't forget to keep your voices down in the hall
[8944]714    Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you been doing
[8945]71   Go and wash them before dinner, please
[8946]0   
[8947]0   
[8948]0   
[8949]10405   'Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the room, leaving Harry alone with Ron and Hermione
[8950]392    Both of them were watching him apprehensively, as though they feared he would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone
[8951]1039    The sight of them looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamed
[8952]457   Look
[8953]0   
[8954]0   
[8955]34371   ' he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and Hermione said quietly, We knew you'd be angry, Harry, we really don't blame you, but you've got to understand, we did try to persuade Dumbledore-'Yeah, I know,' said Harry grudgingly
[8956]14556   He cast around for a topic that didn't involve his headmaster, because the very thought of Dumbledore made Harry's insides burn with anger again
[8957]4868   Who's Kreacher
[8958]356  ' he asked
[8959]7414   The house-elf who lives here,' said Ron
[8960]6    Nutter
[8961]798    Never met one like him
[8962]3624   'Hermione frowned at Ron
[8963]20905   He's not a nutter, Ron-'His life's ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on plaque just like his mother,' said Ron irritably
[8964]1647    Is that normal, Hermione
[8965]13243  'Well-well, if he is a bit strange, it's not his fault-'Ron rolled his eyes at Harry
[8966]4062   Hermione still hasn't given up on spew
[8967]4756   'It's not spew"
[8968]6707  ' said Hermione heatedly
[8969]4759    It's the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare
[8970]14308    And it's not just me, Dumbledore says we should be kind to Kreacher too-'Yeah, yeah,' said Ron
[8971]507    C'mon, I'm starving
[8972]1059   'He led the way out of the door and on to the landing, but before they could descend the stairs- Hold it
[8973]9675  ' Ron breathed, flinging out an arm to stop Harry and Hermione walking any further
[8974]1207    They're still in the hall, we might be able to hear something-'The three of them looked cautiously over the banisters
[8975]10707    The gloomy hallway below was packed with witches and wizards, including all of Harry's guard
[8976]49    They were whispering excitedly together
[8977]8635    In the very centre of the group Harry saw the dark, greasy-haired head and prominent nose of his least favourite teacher at Hogwarts, Professor Snape
[8978]5736    Harry leant further over the banisters
[8979]912    He was very interested in what Snape was doing for the Order of the Phoenix
[8980]0   
[8981]0   
[8982]0   
[8983]11048   A thin piece of flesh-coloured string descended in front of Harry's eyes
[8984]2499    Looking up, he saw Fred and George on the landing above, cautiously lowering the Extendable Ear towards the dark knot of people below
[8985]1110    A moment later, however, they all began to move towards the front door and out of sight
[8986]6550   Dammit,' Harry heard Fred whisper, as he hoisted the Extendable Ear back up again
[8987]1112   They heard the front door open, then close
[8988]8674   Snape never eats here,' Ron told Harry quietly
[8989]45    Thank God
[8990]59    C'mon
[8991]11175   'And don't forget to keep your voice down in the hall, Harry,' Hermione whispered
[8992]1529   As they passed the row of house-elf heads on the wall, they saw Lupin, Mrs
[8993]2333    Weasley, and Tonks at the front door, magically sealing its many locks and bolts behind those who had just left
[8994]479   We're eating down in the kitchen,' Mrs
[8995]901    Weasley whispered, meeting them at the bottom of the stairs
[8996]12676    Harry, dear, if you'll just tiptoe across the hall it's through this door here-'CRASH
[8997]103   Tonks
[8998]409  ' cried Mrs
[8999]1182    Weasley in exasperation, turning to look behind her
[9000]536   I'm sorry
[9001]485  ' wailed Tonks, who was lying flat on the floor
[9002]11519    It's that stupid umbrella stand, that's the second time I've tripped over-'But the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible, ear-splitting, blood-curdling screech
[9003]6460   The moth-eaten velvet curtains Harry had passed earlier had flown apart, but there was no door behind them
[9004]8318    For a split second, Harry thought he was looking through a window, a window behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she were being tortured-then he realised it was simply a life-size portrait, but the most realistic, and the most unpleasant, he had ever seen in his life
[9005]8400   The old woman was drooling, her eyes were rolling, the yellowing skin of her face stretched taut as she screamed, and all along the hall behind them, the other portraits awoke and began to yell, too, so that Harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and clapped his hands over his ears
[9006]2362   Lupin and Mrs Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtains shut over the old woman, but they would not close and she screeched louder than ever, brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at their faces
[9007]4   Filth
[9008]7   Scum
[9009]8   By-products of dirt and vileness
[9010]371   Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place
[9011]5868   How dare you befoul the house of my fathers-'Tonks apologised over and over again, dragging the huge, heavy troll's leg back off the floor; Mrs
[9012]8903    Weasley abandoned the attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall, Stunning all the other portraits with her wand; and a man with long black hair came charging out of a door facing Harry
[9013]459   Shut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP
[9014]443  ' he roared, seizing the curtain Mrs
[9015]645    Weasley had abandoned
[9016]5523   The old woman's face blanched
[9017]1   Yoooou
[9018]728  ' she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of the man
[9019]129    Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh
[9020]5191  'I said-shut-UP
[9021]582  ' roared the man, and with a stupendous effort he and Lupin managed to force the curtains closed again
[9022]5502   The old woman's screeches died and an echoing silence tell
[9023]13525    Panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes, Harry's godfather Sirius turned to face him
[9024]11726   Hello, Harry,' he said grimly, I see you've met my mother

[9046]6368  'My dear old mum, yeah,' said Sirius
[9047]1604    We've been trying to get her down for a month but we think she put a Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of the canvas
[9048]5174    Let's get downstairs, quick, before they all wake up again
[9049]5072   'But what's a portrait of your mother doing here
[9050]8429  ' Harry asked, bewildered, as they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone steps, the others just behind them
[9051]2685   Hasn't anyone told you
[9052]6005   This was my parents' house,' said Sirius
[9053]5704    But I'm the last Black left, so it's mine now
[9054]1876    I offered it to Dumbledore for Headquarters-about the only useful thing I've been able to do
[9055]12152   'Harry, who had expected a better welcome, noted how hard and bitter Sirius's voice sounded
[9056]825    He followed his godfather to the bottom of the steps and through a door leading into the basement kitchen
[9057]856   It was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above, a cavernous room with rough stone walls
[9058]1265    Most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the room
[9059]1504    A haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fumes, through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling
[9060]1603    Many chairs had been crammed into the room for the meeting and a long wooden table stood in the middle of them, littered with rolls of parchment, goblets, empty wine bottles, and a heap of what appeared to be rags
[9061]372    Mr
[9062]1448    Weasley and his eldest son Bill were talking quietly with their heads together at the end of the table
[9063]369   Mrs
[9064]700    Weasley cleared her throat
[9065]1305    Her husband, a thin, balding, red-haired man who wore horn-rimmed glasses, looked around and jumped to his feet
[9066]5732   Harry
[9067]372  ' Mr
[9068]6274    Weasley said, hurrying forward to greet him, and shaking his hand vigorously
[9069]343    Good to see you
[9070]7380  'Over his shoulder Harry saw Bill, who still wore his long hair in a ponytail, hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table
[9071]6314   Journey all right, Harry
[9072]363  ' Bill called, trying to gather up twelve scrolls at once
[9073]3590    Mad-Eye didn't make you come via Greenland, then
[9074]5696  'He tried,' said Tonks, striding over to help Bill and immediately toppling a candle on to the last piece of parchment
[9075]6002    Oh no-sorry-'Here, dear,' said Mrs
[9076]1236    Weasley, sounding exasperated, and she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand
[9077]548    In the flash of light caused by Mrs
[9078]12729    Weasley's charm Harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a building
[9079]369   Mrs
[9080]1424    Weasley had seen him looking
[9081]5096    She snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into Bill's already overladen arms
[9082]1250   This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings,' she snapped, before sweeping off towards an ancient dresser from which she started unloading dinner plates
[9083]730   Bill took out his wand, muttered, Evanesce
[9084]61  ' and the scrolls vanished
[9085]11508   Sit down, Harry' said Sirius
[9086]3255    You've met Mundungus, haven't you
[9087]6311  'The thing Harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged, grunting snore, then jerked awake
[9088]727   Some'n say m'name
[9089]87  ' Mundungus mumbled sleepily
[9090]653    I agree with Sirius
[9091]0   
[9092]0   
[9093]0   
[9094]1133   ' He raised a very grubby hand in the air as though voting, his droopy, bloodshot eyes unfocused
[9095]341   Ginny giggled
[9096]10908   The meeting's over, Dung,' said Sirius, as they all sat down around him at the table
[9097]10548    Harry's arrived
[9098]28   'Eh
[9099]11100  ' said Mundungus, peering bale fully at Harry through his matted ginger hair
[9100]34    Blimey, so e as
[9101]277    Yeah 
[9102]0   
[9103]0   
[9104]563    you all right, arry
[9105]11095  'Yeah,' said Harry
[9106]6452   Mundungus fumbled nervously in his pockets, still staring at Harry, and pulled out a grimy black pipe
[9107]1165    He stuck it in his mouth, ignited the end of it with his wand and took a deep pull on it
[9108]391    Great billowing clouds of greenish smoke obscured him within seconds
[9109]646   Owe you a pology,' grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly cloud
[9110]1104   For the last time, Mundungus,' called Mrs
[9111]967    Weasley, will you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen, especially not when we're about to eat
[9112]5197  'Ah,' said Mundungus
[9113]557    Right
[9114]137    Sorry, Molly
[9115]299   'The cloud of smoke vanished as Mundungus stowed his pipe back in his pocket, but an acrid smell of burning socks lingered
[9116]1890   And if you want dinner before midnight I'll need a hand,' Mrs
[9117]6382    Weasley said to the room at large
[9118]7006    No, you can stay where you are, Harry dear, you've had a long journey-'What can I do, Molly
[9119]5271  ' said Tonks enthusiastically, bounding forwards
[9120]369   Mrs
[9121]1274    Weasley hesitated, looking apprehensive
[9122]6396   Er-no, it's all right, Tonks, you have a rest too, you've done enough today
[9123]480   'No, no, I want to help
[9124]5779  ' said Tonks brightly, knocking over a chair as she hurried towards the dresser, from which Ginny was collecting cutlery
[9125]519   Soon, a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of their own accord, supervised by Mr
[9126]1005    Weasley, while Mrs
[9127]974    Weasley stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates, more goblets and food from the pantry
[9128]6932    Harry was left at the table with Sirius and Mundungus, who was still blinking at him mournfully
[9129]374   Seen old Figgy since
[9130]356  ' he asked
[9131]13439   No,' said Harry, I haven't seen anyone
[9132]37274   'See, I wouldn't ave left,' said Mundungus, leaning forward, a pleading note in his voice, but I ad a business opportunity-'Harry felt something brush against his knees and started, but it was only Crookshanks, Hermione's bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound himself once around Harry's legs, purring, then jumped on to Sirius's lap and curled up
[9133]6869    Sirius scratched him absent-mindedly behind the ears as he turned, still grim-faced, to Harry
[9134]547   Had a good summer so far
[9135]15579  'No, it's been lousy,' said Harry
[9136]6770   For the first time, something like a grin flitted across Sirius's free
[9137]3718   Don't know what you're complaining about, myself
[9138]0   'What
[9139]10832  ' said Harry incredulously
[9140]719   Personally, I'd have welcomed a dementor attack
[9141]67    A deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely
[9142]2262    You think you've had it bad, at least you've been able to get out and about, stretch your legs, get into a few fights
[9143]0   
[9144]0   
[9145]0   
[9146]963    I've been stuck inside for a month
[9147]436   'How come
[9148]6129  ' asked Harry, frowning
[9149]6613   Because the Ministry of Magic's still after me, and Voldemort will know all about me being an Animagus by now, Wormtail will have told him, so my big disguise is useless
[9150]4975    There's not much I can do for the Order of the Phoenix 
[9151]0   
[9152]0   
[9153]823    or so Dumbledore feels
[9154]13768   'There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which Sirius uttered Dumbledore's name that told Harry that Sirius, too, was not very happy with the headmaster eithe
[9155]6063    Harry felt a sudden upsurge of affection for his godfather
[9156]11068   At least you've known what's been going on,' he said bracingly
[9157]6378   Oh yeah,' said Sirius sarcastically
[9158]11542    Listening to Snape's reports, having to take all his snide hints that he's out there risking his life while I'm sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time 
[9159]0   
[9160]0   
[9161]5300    asking me how the cleaning's going-'What cleaning
[9162]6088  ' asked Harry
[9163]6891   Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,' said Sirius, waving a hand around the dismal kitchen
[9164]19746    No one's lived here for ten years, not since my dear mother died, unless you count her old house-elf, and he's gone round the twist, hasn't cleaned anything in ages-'Sirius,' said Mundungus, who did not appear to have paid any attention to the conversation, but had been closely examining an empty goblet
[9165]136    This solid silver, mate
[9166]6037  'Yes,' said Sirius, surveying it with distaste
[9167]443    Finest fifteenth-century goblin-wrought silver, embossed with the Black family crest
[9168]1233   'That'd come orf, though,' muttered Mundungus, polishing it with his cuff
[9169]1635   Fred-George-NO, JUST CARRY THEM
[9170]369  ' Mrs
[9171]665    Weasley shrieked
[9172]7874   Harry, Sirius and Mundungus looked around and, within a split second, they had dived away from the table
[9173]1399    Fred and George had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of Butterbeer, and a heavy wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air towards them
[9174]9157    The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface; the flagon of Butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents everywhere; the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius's right hand had been seconds before
[9175]4772   FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE
[9176]405  ' screamed Mrs
[9177]636    Weasley
[9178]5578    THERE WAS NO NEED- I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS- JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING
[9179]1832  'We were just trying to save a bit of time
[9180]5837  ' said Fred, hurrying forward to wrench the bread knife out of the table
[9181]12296    Sorry, Sirius, mate-didn't mean to-'Harry and Sirius were both laughing; Mundungus, who had toppled backwards off his chair, was swearing as he got to his feet; Crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser, from where his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness
[9182]401   Boys,' Mr
[9183]12860    Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of the table, your mother's right, you're supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you've come of age-'-none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble
[9184]369  ' Mrs
[9185]962    Weasley raged at the twins as she slammed a fresh flagon of Butterbeer onto the table, and spilling almost as much again
[9186]3269    Bill didn't feel the need to Apparate every few feet
[9187]2831   Charlie didn't charm everything he met
[9188]1131   Percy-'She stopped dead, catching her breath with a frightened look at her husband, whose expression was suddenly wooden
[9189]10333   Let's eat,' said Bill quickly
[9190]5673   It looks wonderful, Molly,' said Lupin, ladling stew on to a plate for her and handing it across the table
[9191]308   For a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their food
[9192]369    Then Mrs
[9193]1615    Weasley turned to Sirius
[9194]7237   I've been meaning to tell you, Sirius, there's something trapped in that writing desk in the drawing room, it keeps rattling and shaking
[9195]2381    Of course, it could just be a boggart, but I thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at it before we let it out
[9196]6472   'Whatever you like,' said Sirius indifferently
[9197]404   The curtains in there are full of doxys, too,' Mrs
[9198]834    Weasley went on
[9199]518    I thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow
[9200]6250   'I look forward to it,' said Sirius
[9201]7439    Harry heard the sarcasm in his voice, but he was not sure that anyone else did
[9202]7956   Opposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by transforming her nose between mouthfuls
[9203]18282    Screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry's bedroom, her nose swelled to a beak-like protuberance that resembled Snape's, shrank to the size of a button mushroom and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril
[9204]2124    Apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because Hermione and Ginny were soon requesting their favourite noses
[9205]846   Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks
[9206]0   
[9207]0   
[9208]6895   'Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting impression that a female Dudley was grinning at him from across the table
[9209]372   Mr
[9210]922    Weasley, Bill, and Lupin were having an intense discuss on about goblins
[9211]5500   They're not giving anything away yet,' said Bill
[9212]7262    I still can't work out whether or not they believe he's back
[9213]241    Course, they might prefer not to take sides at all
[9214]0    Keep out of it
[9215]7518   'I'm sure they'd never go over to You-Know-Who,' said Mr
[9216]1222    Weasley, shaking his head
[9217]1523    They've suffered losses too; remember that goblin family he murdered last time, somewhere near Nottingham
[9218]5828  'I think it depends what they're offered,' said Lupin
[9219]646    And I'm not talking about gold
[9220]1212    If they're offered the freedoms we've been denying them for centuries they're going to be tempted
[9221]24    Have you still not had any luck with Ragnok, Bill
[9222]20754  'He's feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,' said Bill, he hasn't stopped raging about the Bagman business, he reckons the Ministry did a cover-up, those goblins never got their gold from him, you know-'A gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of Bill's words
[9223]2918    Fred, George, Ron, and Mundungus were rolling around in their seats
[9224]0   
[9225]0   
[9226]0   
[9227]1598   and then,' choked Mundungus, tears running down his face, and then, if you'll believe it, e says to me, e says,  Ere, Dung, where didja get all them toads from
[9228]4925   Cos some son of a Sludger's gone and nicked all mine
[9229]93   And I says, Nicked all your toads, Will, what next
[9230]588   So you'll be wanting some more, then
[9231]10477   And if you'll believe me, lads, the gormless gargoyle buys all is own toads back orf me for a lot more'n what e paid in the first place-'I don't think we need to hear any more of your business dealings, thank you very much, Mundungus,' said Mrs
[9232]3052    Weasley sharply, as Ron slumped forwards on to the table, howling with laughter
[9233]11444   Beg pardon, Molly,' said Mundungus at once, wiping his eyes and winking at Harry
[9234]13982    But, you know, Will nicked em orf Warty Harris in the first place so I wasn't really doing nothing wrong-'I don't know where you learned about right and wrong, Mundungus, but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons,' said Mrs
[9235]668    Weasley coldly
[9236]1272   Fred and George buried their faces in their goblets of Butterbeer; George was hiccoughing
[9237]412    For some reason, Mrs
[9238]2927    Weasley threw a very nasty look at Sirius before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding
[9239]6553    Harry looked round at his godfather
[9240]8264   Molly doesn't approve of Mundungus,' said Sirius in an undertone
[9241]5338   How come he's in the Order
[9242]10955  ' Harry said, very quietly
[9243]5524   He's useful,' Sirius muttered
[9244]4861    Knows all the crooks-well, he would, seeing as he's one himself
[9245]5649    But he's also very loyal to Dumbledore, who helped him out of a tight spot once
[9246]3835    It pays to have someone like Dung around, he hears things we don't
[9247]861    But Molly thinks inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far
[9248]2484    She hasn't forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you
[9249]15869   'Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on Harry's jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was saying something as the jeans had once been Dudley's)
[9250]67    As he laid down his spoon there was a lull in the general conversation
[9251]372    Mr
[9252]2513    Weasley was leaning back in his chair, looking replete and relaxed, Tonks was yawning widely, her nose now back to normal, and Ginny, who had lured Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on the floor, rolling Butterbeer corks for him to chase
[9253]6869   Nearly time for bed, I think,' said Mrs
[9254]642    Weasley with a yawn
[9255]13253   Not just yet, Molly,' said Sirius, pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at Harry
[9256]1254    You know, I'm surprised at you
[9257]2265    I thought the first thing you'd do when you got here would be to start asking questions about Voldemort
[9258]6308   'The atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry associated with the arrival of dementors
[9259]100    Where seconds before it had been sleepily relaxed, it was now alert, even tense
[9260]5356    A frisson had gone around the table at the mention of Voldemort's name
[9261]947    Lupin, who had been about to take a sip of wine, lowered his goblet slowly, looking wary
[9262]667   I did
[9263]10835  ' said Harry indignantly
[9264]15457    I asked Ron and Hermione but they said we're not allowed in the Order, so-'And they're quite right,' said Mrs
[9265]636    Weasley
[9266]43    You're too young
[9267]528   'She was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists clenched an its arms, every trace of drowsiness gone
[9268]1044   Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to ask questions
[9269]1003  ' asked Sirius
[9270]10842    Harry's been trapped in that Muggle house for a month
[9271]11583    He's got the right to know what's been happen-'Hang on
[9272]535  ' interrupted George loudly
[9273]6247   How come Harry gets his questions answered
[9274]5597  ' said Fred angrily
[9275]4019   We've been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you haven't told us a single stinking thing
[9276]5464  ' said George
[9277]12008   You're too young, you're not in the Order,' said Fred, in a high-pitched voice that sounded uncannily like his mother's
[9278]10509    Harry's not even of age
[9279]23207  'It's not my fault you haven't been told what the Order's doing,' said Sirius calmly, that's your parents' decision
[9280]21685    Harry, on the other hand-'It's not down to you to decide what's good for Harry
[9281]5455  ' said Mrs
[9282]691    Weasley sharply
[9283]1408    The expression on her normally kind face looked dangerous
[9284]8445    You haven't forgotten what Dumbledore said, I suppose
[9285]194  'Which bit
[9286]1322  ' Sirius asked politely, but with the air of a man readying himself for a fight
[9287]12262   The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs to know,' said Mrs
[9288]802    Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words
[9289]10255   Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George's heads swivelled from Sirius to Mrs
[9290]682    Weasley as though they were following a tennis rally
[9291]1180    Ginny was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned Butterbeer corks, watching the conversation with her mouth slightly open
[9292]6067    Lupin's eyes were fixed on Sirius
[9293]9838   I don't intend to tell him more than he needs to know, Molly,' said Sirius
[9294]6757    But as he was the one who saw Voldemort come back' (again, there was a collective shudder around the table at the name), he has more right than most to-'He's not a member of the Order of the Phoenix
[9295]5455  ' said Mrs
[9296]636    Weasley
[9297]24892    He's only fifteen and- '-and he's dealt with as much as most in the Order,' said Sirius, and more than some-'No one's denying what he's done
[9298]5455  ' said Mrs
[9299]1455    Weasley, her voice rising, her fists trembling on the arms of her chair
[9300]9504    But he's still-'He's not a child
[9301]5778  ' said Sirius impatiently
[9302]4752   He's not an adult either
[9303]5455  ' said Mrs
[9304]693    Weasley, the colour rising in her cheeks
[9305]5475    He's not James, Sirius
[9306]6387  'I'm perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,' said Sirius coldly
[9307]668   I'm not sure you are
[9308]5455  ' said Mrs
[9309]636    Weasley
[9310]7322    Sometimes, the way you talk about him, it's as though you think you've got your best friend back
[9311]4828  'What's wrong with that
[9312]10818  ' said Harry
[9313]11846   What's wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, however much you might look like him
[9314]5455  ' said Mrs
[9315]1772    Weasley, her eyes still boring into Sirius
[9316]258    You are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it
[9317]483  'Meaning I'm an irresponsible godfather
[9318]1245  ' demanded Sirius, his voice rising
[9319]3239   Meaning you have been known to act rashly, Sirius, which is why Dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and-'We'll leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of this, if you please
[9320]5869  ' said Sirius loudly
[9321]66   Arthur
[9322]5455  ' said Mrs
[9323]654    Weasley rounding on her husband
[9324]66    Arthur, back me up
[9325]372  'Mr
[9326]1379    Weasley did not speak at once
[9327]1186    He took off his glasses and cleaned them slowly on his robes, not looking at his wife
[9328]867    Only when he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he reply
[9329]978   Dumbledore knows the position has changed, Molly
[9330]11021    He accepts that Harry will have to be filled in, to a certain extent, now that he is staying at headquarters-'Yes, but there's a difference between that and inviting him to ask whatever he likes
[9331]7365  'Personally,' said Lupin quietly, looking away from Sirius at last, as Mrs
[9332]7813    Weasley turned quickly to him, hopeful that finally she was about to get an ally, I think it better that Harry gets the facts-not all the facts, Molly, but the general picture-from us, rather than a garbled version from 
[9333]0   
[9334]0   
[9335]0    others
[9336]7240   'His expression was mild, but Harry felt sure Lupin, at least, knew that some Extendable Ears had survived Mrs
[9337]5391    Weasley's purge
[9338]8088   Well,' said Mrs Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come, well 
[9339]0   
[9340]0   
[9341]931    I can see I'm going to be overruled
[9342]30366    I'll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has Harry's best interests at heart-'He's not your son,' said Sirius quietly
[9343]10548   He's as good as,' said Mrs
[9344]655    Weasley fiercely
[9345]690    Who else has he got
[9346]5440  'He's got me
[9347]14989  'Yes,' said Mrs Weasley, her lip curling, the thing is, it's been rather difficult for you to look after him while you've been locked up in Azkaban, hasn't it
[9348]883  'Sirius started to rise from his chair
[9349]11373   Molly, you're not the only person at this table who cares about Harry,' said Lupin sharply
[9350]690    Sirius, sit down
[9351]369   'Mrs
[9352]125    Weasleys lower lip was trembling
[9353]1529    Sirius sank slowly back into his chair, his face white
[9354]11885   I think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this,' Lupin continued, he's old enough to decide for himself
[9355]17163   'I want to know what's been going on,' Harry said at once
[9356]1493   He did not look at Mrs
[9357]636    Weasley
[9358]5493    He had been touched by what she had said about his being as good as a son, but he was also impatient with her mollycoddling
[9359]1208    Sirius was right, he was not a child
[9360]5455   Very well,' said Mrs
[9361]1181    Weasley, her voice cracking
[9362]5178    Ginny-Ron-Hermione-Fred-George-I want, you out of this kitchen, now
[9363]19   'There was instant uproar
[9364]27   We're of age
[9365]840  ' Fred and George bellowed together
[9366]12836   If Harry's allowed, why can't I
[9367]2137  ' shouted Ron
[9368]603   Mum, I want to hear
[9369]341  ' wailed Ginny
[9370]0   NO
[9371]504  ' shouted Mrs
[9372]1266    Weasley, standing up, her eyes overbright
[9373]8770    I absolutely forbid-'Molly you can't stop Fred and George,' said Mr
[9374]648    Weasley wearily
[9375]5715    They are of age-'They're still at school-'But they're legally adults now,' said Mr
[9376]1196    Weasley, in the same tired voice
[9377]369   Mrs
[9378]1188    Weasley was now scarlet in the face
[9379]12314   I-oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but Ron-'Harry'll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway
[9380]7096  ' said Ron hotly
[9381]4888    Won't-won't you
[9382]11141  ' he added uncertainly, meeting Harry's eyes
[9383]11449   For a split second, Harry considered telling Ron that he wouldn't tell him a single word, that he could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked it
[9384]769    But the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at each other
[9385]11035   Course I will,' Harry said
[9386]3636   Ron and Hermione beamed
[9387]75   Fine
[9388]504  ' shouted Mrs
[9389]636    Weasley
[9390]75    Fine
[9391]513   Ginny-BED
[9392]1140  'Ginny did not go quietly
[9393]1412    They could hear her raging and storming at her mother all the way up the stairs, and when she reached the hall Mrs
[9394]170    Blacks ear-splitting shrieks were added to the din
[9395]326    Lupin hurried off to the portrait to restore calm
[9396]1771    It was only after he had returned, closing the kitchen door behind him and taking his seat at the table again, that Sirius spoke
[9397]5814   OK, Harry 
[9398]0   
[9399]0   
[9400]1106    what do you want to know
[9401]6558  'Harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had obsessed him for the last month
[9402]4983   Where's Voldemort
[9403]5116  ' he said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the name
[9404]4932    What's he doing
[9405]18293   I've been trying to watch the Muggle news, and there hasn't been anything that looks like him yet, no funny deaths or anything-'That's because there haven't been any funny deaths yet,' said Sirius, not as far as we know, anyway
[9406]0   
[9407]0   
[9408]0   
[9409]1050    And we know quite a lot
[9410]5301   'More than he thinks we do, anyway,' said Lupin
[9411]5628   How come he's stopped killing people
[9412]6088  ' Harry asked
[9413]702    He knew Voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone
[9414]8543   Because he doesn't want to draw attention to himself,' said Sirius
[9415]47    It would be dangerous for him
[9416]3861    His comeback didn't come off quite the way he wanted it to, you see
[9417]5    He messed it up
[9418]5373   'Or rather, you messed it up for him,' said Lupin, with a satisfied smile
[9419]0   How
[9420]6096  ' Harry asked, perplexed
[9421]2450   You weren't supposed to survive
[9422]5733  ' said Sirius
[9423]2206    Nobody apart from his Death Eaters was supposed to know he'd come back
[9424]38    But you survived to bear witness
[9425]7331   'And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was Dumbledore,' said Lupin
[9426]1322    And you made sure Dumbledore knew at once
[9427]19   'How has that helped
[9428]6088  ' Harry asked
[9429]5   Are you kidding
[9430]5100  ' said Bill incredulously
[9431]1620    Dumbledore was the only one You-Know-Who was ever scared of
[9432]7311  'Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort returned,' said Sirius
[9433]5084   So, what's the Order been doing
[9434]11423  ' said Harry, looking around at them all
[9435]8946   Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort can't carry out his plans,' said Sirius
[9436]1406   How d'you know what his plans are
[9437]6243  ' Harry asked quickly
[9438]17290   Dumbledore's got a shrewd idea,' said Lupin, and Dumbledore's shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate
[9439]5732   'So what does Dumbledore reckon he's planning
[9440]5793  'Well, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,' said Sirius
[9441]2000    In the old days he had huge numbers at his command: witches and wizards he'd bullied or bewitched into following him, his faithful Death Eaters, a great variety of Dark creatures
[9442]6463    You heard him planning to recruit the giants; well, they'll be just one of the groups he's after
[9443]6068    He's certainly not going to try and take on the Ministry of Magic with only a dozen Death Eaters
[9444]486   'So you're trying to stop him getting more followers
[9445]5523  'We're doing our best,' said Lupin
[9446]0   How
[9447]6864  'Well, the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible that You-Know-Who really has returned, to put them on their guard,' said Bill
[9448]4756    It's proving tricky, though
[9449]0   'Why
[9450]10167  'Because of the Ministry's attitude,' said Tonks
[9451]7286    You saw Cornelius Fudge after You-Know-Who came back, Harry
[9452]2402    Well, he hasn't shifted his position at all
[9453]9771    He's absolutely refusing to believe it's happened
[9454]0   'But why
[9455]10851  ' said Harry desperately
[9456]4821    Why's he being so stupid
[9457]7075   If Dumbledore-'Ah, well, you've put your finger on the problem,' said Mr
[9458]737    Weasley with a wry smile
[9459]817    Dumbledore
[9460]5428   'Fudge is frightened of him, you see,' said Tonks sadly
[9461]844   Frightened of Dumbledore
[9462]10832  ' said Harry incredulously
[9463]10235   Frightened of what he's up to,' said Mr
[9464]636    Weasley
[9465]5821    Fudge thinks Dumbledore's plotting to overthrow him
[9466]1182    He thinks Dumbledore wants to be Minister for Magic
[9467]11661   'But Dumbledore doesn't want-'Of course he doesn't,' said Mr
[9468]636    Weasley
[9469]10379    He's never wanted the Minister's job, even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when Millicent Bagnold retired
[9470]7230    Fudge came to power instead, but he's never quite forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore had, even though Dumbledore never applied for the job
[9471]12682   'Deep down, Fudge knows Dumbledore's much cleverer than he is, a much more powerful wizard, and in the early days of his Ministry he was forever asking Dumbledore for help and advice,' said Lupin
[9472]4806    But it seems he's become fond of power, and much more confident
[9473]15574    He loves being Minister for Magic and he's managed to convince himself that he's the clever one and Dumbledore's simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it
[9474]562   'How can he think that
[9475]10901  ' said Harry angrily
[9476]3216    How can he think Dumbledore would just make it all up-that I'd make it all up
[9477]14424  'Because accepting that Voldermort's back would mean trouble like the Ministry hasn't had to cope with for nearly fourteen years,' said Sirius bitterly
[9478]3867    Fudge just can't bring himself to face it
[9479]10416    It's so much more comfortable to convince himself Dumbledore's lying to destabilise him
[9480]5280   'You see the problem,' said Lupin
[9481]14334    While the Ministry insists there is nothing to fear from Voldemort it's hard to convince people he's back, especially as they really don't want to believe it in the first place
[9482]20920    What's more, the Ministry's leaning heavily on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what they're calling Dumbledore's rumour-mongering, so most of the wizarding community are completely unaware anything's happened, and that makes them easy targets for the Death Eaters if they're using the Imperius Curse
[9483]2766   'But you're telling people, aren't you
[9484]11795  ' said Harry, looking around at Mr
[9485]1610    Weasley, Sirius, Bill, Mundungus, Lupin and Tonks
[9486]5849    You're letting people know he's back
[9487]36  'They all smiled humourlessly
[9488]6282   Well, as everyone thinks I'm a mad mass-murderer and the Ministry's put a ten thousand Galleon price on my head, I can hardly stroll up the street and start handing out leaflets, can I
[9489]5740  ' said Sirius restlessly
[9490]5777   And I'm not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community,' said Lupin
[9491]4767    It's an occupational hazard of being a werewolf
[9492]11776   'Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they started shooting their mouths off,' said Sirius, and it's very important for us to have spies inside the Ministry, because you can bet Voldemort will have them
[9493]6590   'We've managed to convince a couple of people, though,' said Mr
[9494]636    Weasley
[9495]21783    Tonks here, for one-she's too young to have been in the Order of the Phoenix last time, and having Aurors on our side is a huge advantage- Kingsley Shacklebolt's been a real asset, too; he's in charge of the hunt for Sirius, so he's been feeding the Ministry information that Sirius is in Tibet
[9496]10926   'But if none of you are putting the news out that Voldemort's back-' Harry began
[9497]5176   Who said none of us are putting the news out
[9498]5733  ' said Sirius
[9499]6818    Why d'you think Dumbledore's in such trouble
[9500]852  'What d'you mean
[9501]6088  ' Harry asked
[9502]5485   They're trying to discredit him,' said Lupin
[9503]2877    Didn't you see the Daily Prophet last week
[9504]16074   They reported that he'd been voted out of the Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards because he's getting old and losing his grip, but it's not true; he was voted out by Ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing Voldemort's return
[9505]6670    They've demoted him from Chief Warlock on the Wizengamot-that's the Wizard High Court-and they're talking about taking away his Order of Merlin, First Class, too
[9506]11873   'But Dumbledore says he doesn't care what they do as long as they don't take him off the Chocolate Frog Cards,' said Bill, grinning
[9507]10350   It's no laughing matter,' said Mr
[9508]691    Weasley sharply
[9509]2590    If he carries on defying the Ministry like this he could end up in Azkaban, and the last thing we want is to have Dumbledore locked up
[9510]16409    While You-Know-Who knows Dumbledore's out there and wise to what he's up to he's going to go cautiously
[9511]6779    If Dumbledore's out of the way-well, You-Know-Who will have a clear field
[9512]17849   'But if Voldemort's trying to recruit more Death Eaters it's bound to get out that he's come back, isn't it
[9513]6121  ' asked Harry desperately
[9514]19331   Voldemort doesn't march up to people's houses and bang on their front doors, Harry,' said Sirius
[9515]19    He tricks, jinxes and blackmails them
[9516]4796    He's well-practised at operating in secret
[9517]5038    In any case, gathering followers is only one thing he's interested in
[9518]10634    He's got other plans too, plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed, and he's concentrating on those for the moment
[9519]4792   'What's he after apart from followers
[9520]6104  ' Harry asked swiftly
[9521]2362    He thought he saw Sirius and Lupin exchange the most fleeting of looks before Sirius answered, Stuff he can only get by stealth
[9522]12792   'When Harry continued to look puzzled, Sirius said, Like a weapon
[9523]3264    Something he didn't have last time
[9524]24   'When he was powerful before
[9525]292  'Yes
[9526]855   'Like what kind of weapon
[9527]10818  ' said Harry
[9528]63    Something worse than the Avada Kedavra-
[9529]4750  'That's enough
[9530]369  'Mrs
[9531]1216    Weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door
[9532]8771    Harry hadn't noticed her return from taking Ginny upstairs
[9533]816    Her arms were crossed and she looked furious
[9534]512   I want you in bed, now
[9535]5122    All of you,' she added, looking around at Fred, George, Ron and Hermione
[9536]2863   You can't boss us-' Fred began
[9537]487   Watch me,' snarled Mrs
[9538]636    Weasley
[9539]1526    She was trembling slightly as she looked at Sirius
[9540]6559    You've given Harry plenty of information
[9541]967    Any more and you might just as well induct him into the Order straightaway
[9542]0   'Why not
[9543]10973  ' said Harry quickly
[9544]1341    I'll join, I want to join, I want to fight
[9545]0   'No
[9546]1790   'It was not Mrs Weasley who spoke this time, but Lupin
[9547]5348   The Order is comprised only of overage wizards,' he said
[9548]1683    Wizards who have left school,' he added, as Fred and George opened their mouths
[9549]121    There are dangers involved of which you can have no idea, any of you
[9550]0   
[9551]0   
[9552]6558    I think Molly's right, Sirius
[9553]5779    We've said enough
[9554]1513   'Sirius half-shrugged but did not argue
[9555]369    Mrs
[9556]658    Weasley beckoned imperiously to her sons and Herrnione
[9557]6031    One by one they stood up and Harry, recognising defeat, followed suit

[9580]369     Mrs
[9581]1413    Weasley followed them upstairs looking grim
[9582]7618   I want you all to go straight to bed, no talking,' she said as they reached the first landing, we've got a busy day tomorrow
[9583]6999    I expect Ginny's asleep,' she added to Hermione, so try not to wake her up
[9584]8287   'Asleep, yeah, right,' said Fred in an undertone, after Hermione bade them goodnight and they were climbing to the next floor
[9585]12784    If Ginny's not lying awake waiting for Hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs then I'm a Flobberworm
[9586]0   
[9587]0   
[9588]0   
[9589]13746   'All right, Ron, Harry,' said Mrs
[9590]968    Weasley on the second landing, pointing them into their bedroom
[9591]177    Off to bed with you
[9592]13037   '' Night,' Harry and Ron said to the twins
[9593]5593   Sleep tight,' said Fred, winking
[9594]369   Mrs
[9595]7015    Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a sharp snap
[9596]823    The bedroom looked, if anything, even danker and gloomier than it had on first sight
[9597]458    The blank picture on the wall was now breathing very slowly and deeply, as though its invisible occupant was asleep
[9598]8577    Harry put on his pyjamas, took off his glasses, and climbed into his chilly bed while Ron threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around and rustling their wings restlessly
[9599]5038   We can't let them out to hunt every night,' Ron explained as he pulled on his maroon pyjamas
[9600]4749    Dumbledore doesn't want too many owls swooping around the square, thinks it'll look suspicious
[9601]639    Oh yeah

[9604]21    I forgot

[9608]537   'He crossed to the door and bolted it
[9609]182   What're you doing that for
[9610]7678  'Kreacher,' said Ron as he turned off the light
[9611]522    First night I was here he came wandering in at three in the morning
[9612]3769    Trust me, you don't want to wake up and find him prowling around your room
[9613]0    Anyway
[9614]0   
[9615]0   
[9616]7469   ' He got into his bed, settled down under the covers, then turned to look at Harry in the darkness
[9617]6593    Harry could see his outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window, what d'you reckon
[9618]10781  'Harry didn't need to ask what Ron meant
[9619]6156   Well, they didn't tell us much we couldn't have guessed, did they
[9620]10291  ' he said, thinking of all that had been said downstairs
[9621]14011    I mean, all they've really said is that the Order's trying to stop people joining Vol-'There was a sharp intake of breath from Ron
[9622]10864   -demort,' said Harry firmly
[9623]593    When are you going to start using his name
[9624]811   Sirius and Lupin do
[9625]2034   'Ron ignored this last comment
[9626]6776   Yeah, you're right,' he said, we already knew nearly everything they told us, from using the Extendable Ears
[9627]370    The only new bit was-'Crack
[9628]12   OUCH
[9629]3187  'Keep your voice down, Ron, or Mum'll be back up here
[9630]853   'You two just Apparated on my knees
[9631]19184  'Yeah, well, it's harder in the dark-'Harry saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George leaping down from Ron's bed
[9632]11337    There was a groan of bedsprings and Harry's mattress descended a few inches as George sat down near his feet
[9633]690   So, got there yet
[9634]5515  ' said George eagerly
[9635]696   The weapon Sirius mentioned
[9636]10818  ' said Harry
[9637]8712   Let slip, more like,' said Fred with relish, now sitting next to Ron
[9638]3754    We didn't hear about that on the old Extendables, did we
[9639]671  'What d'you reckon it is
[9640]10818  ' said Harry
[9641]5514   Could be anything,' said Fred
[9642]2414   But there can't be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse, can there
[9643]7088  ' said Ron
[9644]4975    What's worse than death
[9645]5640  'Maybe it's something that can kill loads of people at once,' suggested George
[9646]12642   Maybe it's some particularly painful way of killing people,' said Ron learfully
[9647]19002   He's got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,' said Harry, he doesn't need anything more efficient than that
[9648]6845   'There was a pause and Harry knew that the others, like him, were wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate
[9649]6623   So who d'you think's got it now
[9650]734  ' asked George
[9651]12136   I hope it's our side,' said Ron, sounding slightly nervous
[9652]11189   If it is, Dumbledore's probably keeping it,' said Fred
[9653]0   Where
[9654]7243  ' said Ron quickly
[9655]240    Hogwarts
[9656]41  'Bet it is
[9657]5464  ' said George
[9658]9624    That's where he hid the Philosopher's Stone
[9659]5485   'A weapon's going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, though
[9660]7088  ' said Ron
[9661]5516   Not necessarily,' said Fred
[9662]5820   Yeah, size is no guarantee of power,' said George
[9663]793    Look at Ginny
[9664]852   'What d'you mean
[9665]10818  ' said Harry
[9666]939   You've never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat-Bogey Hexes, have you
[9667]2  'Shhh
[9668]5896  ' said Fred, half-rising from the bed
[9669]75    Listen
[9670]200  'They fell silent
[9671]227    Footsteps were coming up the stairs
[9672]12110   Mum,' said George and without further ado there was a loud crack and Harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed
[9673]1470    A few seconds later, they heard the floorboard creak outside their door; Mrs
[9674]885    Weasley was plainly listening to check whether or not they were talking
[9675]104   Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully
[9676]1197    The floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and George
[9677]10293   She doesn't trust us at all, you know,' said Ron regretfully
[9678]7099   Harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had been so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over
[9679]2708    He wanted to continue talking to Ron, but Mrs
[9680]1597    Weasley was now creaking back downstairs again, and once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs

[9684]10040    In fact, many-legged creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door, and Hagrid, the Care of Magical Creatures teacher, was saying, Beauties, aren't they, eh, Harry

[9697]6755   The next thing he knew, he was curled into a warm ball under his bedclothes and George's loud voice was filling the room
[9698]6064   Mum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs you in the drawing room, there are loads more doxys than she thought and she's found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa
[9699]10268   'Half an hour later, Harry and Ron, who had dressed and breakfasted quickly, entered the drawing room, a long, high-ceilinged room on the first floor with olive-green walls covered in dirty tapestries
[9700]1475    The carpet exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot on it and the long, moss-green velvet curtains were buzzing as though swarming with invisible bees
[9701]369    It was around these that Mrs
[9702]4324    Weasley, Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and George were grouped, all looking rather peculiar as they had each tied a cloth over their nose and mouth
[9703]812    Each of them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at the end
[9704]455   Cover your faces and take a spray,' Mrs
[9705]14778    Weasley said to Harry and Ron the moment she saw them, pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a spindle-legged table
[9706]4752    It's Doxycide
[9707]20416    I've never seen an infestation this bad-what that house-elf's been doing for the last ten years-'Hermione's face was half concealed by a tea towel but Harry distinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at Mrs
[9708]636    Weasley
[9709]17695   Kreacher's really old, he probably couldn't manage-'You'd be surprised what Kreacher can manage when he wants to, Hermione,' said Sirius, who had just entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats
[9710]12562    I've just been feeding Buckbeak,' he added, in reply to Harry's enquiring look

[9718]6894   'He dropped the bag of rats into an armchair, then bent over to examine the locked cabinet which, Harry now noticed for the first time, was shaking slightly
[9719]7629   Well, Molly, I'm pretty sure this is a boggart,' said Sirius, peering through the keyhole, but perhaps we ought to let Mad-Eye have a shifty at it before we let it out-knowing my mother, it could be something much worse
[9720]6659   'Right you are, Sirius,' said Mrs
[9721]636    Weasley
[9722]6774   They were both speaking in carefully light, polite voices that told Harry quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of the night before
[9723]777   A loud, clanging bell sounded from downstairs, followed at once by the cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previous night by Tonks knocking over the umbrella stand
[9724]106   I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell
[9725]6211  ' said Sirius exasperatedly, hurrying out of the room
[9726]724    They heard him thundering clown the stairs as Mrs
[9727]5565    Black's screeches echoed up through the house once more: Stains of dishonour, filthy half-breeds, blood traitors, children of flith
[9728]0   
[9729]0   
[9730]11783   'Close the door, please, Harry,' said Mrs
[9731]636    Weasley
[9732]8348   Harry took as much time as he dared to close the drawing-room door; he wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs
[9733]1082    Sirius had obviously managed to shut the curtains over his mothers portrait because she had stopped screaming
[9734]25173    He heard Sirius walking down the hall, then the clattering of the chain on the front door, and then a deep voice he recognised as Kingsley Shacklebolt's saying, Hestia's just relieved me, so she's got Moody's Cloak now, thought I'd leave a report for Dumbledore
[9735]0   
[9736]0   
[9737]0   
[9738]13731   'Feeling Mrs Weasley's eyes on the back of his head, Harry regretfully closed the drawing-room door and rejoined the doxy party
[9739]369   Mrs
[9740]6077    Weasley was bending over to check the page on doxys in Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to Household Pests, which was lying open on the sofa
[9741]939   Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because doxys bite and their teeth are poisonous
[9742]2080    I've got a bottle of antidote here, but I'd rather nobody needed it
[9743]128   'She straightened up, positioned herself squarely in front of the curtains and beckoned them all forward
[9744]5564   When I say the word, start spraying immediately,' she said
[9745]1563    They'll come flying out at us, I expect, but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyse them
[9746]839    When they're immobilized, just throw them in this bucket
[9747]287   'She stepped carefully out of their line of fire, and raised her own spray
[9748]559   All right-squirt
[9749]8452  'Harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a fully-grown doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material, shiny beetle-like wings whirring, tiny needle-sharp teeth bared, its fairy-like body covered with thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury
[9750]6656    Harry caught it full in the face with a blast of Doxycide; it froze in midair and fell, with a surprisingly loud thunk, on to the worn carpet below
[9751]5834    Harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket
[9752]610   Fred, what are you doing
[9753]5455  ' said Mrs
[9754]691    Weasley sharply
[9755]369    Spray that at once and throw it away
[9756]6533  'Harry looked round
[9757]557    Fred was holding a struggling doxy between his forefinger and thumb
[9758]7548   Right-o,' Fred said brightly, spraying the doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted, but the moment Mrs
[9759]5728    Weasley's back was turned he pocketed it with a wink
[9760]6891   We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes,' George told Harry under his breath
[9761]6888   Deftly spraying two doxys at once as they soared straight for his nose, Harry moved closer to George and muttered out of the corner of his mouth, What are Skiving Snackboxes
[9762]1304  'Range of sweets to make you ill,' George whispered, keeping a wary eye on Mrs
[9763]5386    Weasley's back
[9764]2032    Not seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it
[9765]496    Fred and I have been developing them this summer
[9766]72    They're double-ended, colour-coded chews
[9767]243    If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you throw up
[9768]1481    Moment you've been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half-'"-which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom
[9769]5718    That's what we're putting in the adverts, anyway,' whispered Fred, who had edged over out of Mrs
[9770]5811    Weasley's line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray doxys from the floor and adding them to his pocket
[9771]480    But they still need a bit of work
[9772]1278    At the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping themselves puking long enough to swallow the purple end
[9773]4   'Testers
[9774]5514  'Us,' said Fred
[9775]12    We take it in turns
[9776]7749    George did the Fainting Fancies-we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat-'Mum thought we'd been duelling,' said George
[9777]65   Joke shop still on, then
[9778]5868  ' Harry muttered, pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his spray
[9779]8971   Well, we haven't had a chance to get premises yet,' said Fred, dropping his voice even lower as Mrs
[9780]1227    Weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before returning to the attack, so we're running it as a mail-order service at the moment
[9781]170    We put advertisements in the Daily Prophet last week
[9782]5525   'All thanks to you, mate,' said George
[9783]2986    But don't worry 
[9784]0   
[9785]0   
[9786]3151    Mum hasn't got a clue
[9787]3643    She won't read the Daily Prophet any more, cause of it telling lies about you and Dumbledore
[9788]5747   'Harry grinned
[9789]2568    He had forced the Weasley twins to take the thousand-Galleon prize money he had won in the Triwizard Tournament to help them realise their ambition to open a joke shop, but he was still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown to Mrs
[9790]636    Weasley
[9791]1380    She did not think running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons
[9792]341   The de-doxying of the curtains took most of the morning
[9793]525    It was past midday when Mrs
[9794]1224    Weasley finally removed her protective scarf, sank into a sagging armchair, and sprang up again with a cry of disgust, having sat on the bag of dead rats
[9795]1579    The curtains were no longer buzzing; they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying; unconscious doxys lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them beside a bowl of their black eggs, at which Crookshanks was now sniffing and Fred and George were shooting covetous looks
[9796]1164   I think we'll tackle those after lunch
[9797]369   'Mrs
[9798]1008    Weasley pointed at the dusty glass-fronted cabinets standing on either side of the mantelpiece
[9799]12738    They were crammed with an odd assortment of objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages Harry could not understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper, full of what Harry was quite sure was blood
[9800]45   The clanging doorbell rang again
[9801]1045    Everyone looked at Mrs
[9802]636    Weasley
[9803]5662   Stay here,' she said firmly, snatching up the bag of rats as Mrs
[9804]127    Blacks screeches started up again from down below
[9805]608    I'll bring up some sandwiches
[9806]1299   'She left the room, closing the door carefully behind her
[9807]645    At once, everyone dashed over to the window to look down on the doorstep
[9808]522    They could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of precariously balanced cauldrons
[9809]60   Mundungus
[9810]6701  ' said Hermione
[9811]4800    What's he brought all those cauldrons for
[9812]11704  'Probably looking for a safe place to keep them,' said Harry
[9813]2877    Isn't that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me
[9814]36   Picking up dodgy cauldrons
[9815]834  'Yeah, you're right
[9816]6349  ' said Fred, as the front door opened; Mundungus heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view
[9817]3274    Blimey, Mum won't like that
[9818]0   
[9819]0   
[9820]0   
[9821]1183   'He and George crossed to the door and stood beside it, listening closely
[9822]369    Mrs
[9823]5126    Black's screaming had stopped
[9824]1483   Mundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley,' Fred muttered, frowning with concentration
[9825]2521    Can't hear properly 
[9826]0   
[9827]0   
[9828]800    d'you reckon we can risk the Extendable Ears
[9829]5490  'Might be worth it,' said George
[9830]824    I could sneak upstairs and get a pair-'But at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from downstairs that rendered Extendable Ears quite unnecessary
[9831]659    All of them could hear exactly what Mrs
[9832]1205    Weasley was shouting at the top of her voice
[9833]75   WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN GOODS
[9834]7421  'I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,' said Fred, with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow Mrs
[9835]6667    Weasley's voice to permeate the room better, it makes such a nice change
[9836]9565   '-COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE-'The idiots are letting her get into her stride,' said George, shaking his head
[9837]2476    You've got to head her off early otherwise she builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours
[9838]16183    And she's been dying to have a go at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you, Harry-and there goes Sirius's mum again
[9839]369   'Mrs
[9840]6268    Weasley's voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits in the hall
[9841]1822   George made to shut the door to drown the noise, but before he could do so, a house-elf edged into the room
[9842]905   Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was completely naked
[9843]865    It looked very old
[9844]1726    Its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and, though it was bald like all house-elves, there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears
[9845]866    Its eyes were a bloodshot and watery grey and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike
[9846]6203   The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest
[9847]7205    Acting as though it could not see them, it shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and doggedly, towards the far end of the room, all the while muttering under its breath in a hoarse, deep voice like a bullfrog's, 
[9848]0   
[9849]0   
[9850]14498   smells like a drain and a criminal to boot, but she's no better, nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my mistress's house, oh, my poor mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum they've let into her house, what would she say to old Kreacher, oh, the shame of it, Mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves, poor old Kreacher, what can he do
[9851]0   
[9852]0   
[9853]0   
[9854]6347   'Hello, Kreacher,' said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a snap
[9855]847   The house-elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, and gave a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise
[9856]6478   Kreacher did not see Young Master,' he said, turning around and bowing to Fred
[9857]576    Still lacing the carpet, he added, perfectly audibly, Nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is
[9858]95   'Sorry
[9859]5464  ' said George
[9860]2950    Didn't catch that last bit
[9861]16085   'Kreacher said nothing,' said the elf, with a second bow to George, adding in a clear undertone, and there's its twin, unnataral little beasts they are
[9862]9264   'Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not
[9863]501    The elf straightened up, eyeing them all malevolently, and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutter
[9864]0   
[9865]0   
[9866]0   
[9867]14887   and there's the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh if my mistress knew, oh, how she'd cry, and there's a new boy, Kreacher doesn't know his name
[9868]182    What is he doing here
[9869]3306   Kreacher doesn't know
[9870]0   
[9871]0   
[9872]12563   'This is Harry, Kreacher,' said Hermione tentatively
[9873]6193    Harry Potter
[9874]5572   'Kreacher's pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than ever
[9875]9144   The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if Kreacher's mistress saw him in such company, oh, what would she say-'Don't call her a Mudblood
[9876]7507  ' said Ron and Ginny together, very angrily
[9877]33133   It doesn't matter,' Hermione whispered, he's not in his right mind, he doesn't know what he's-'Don't kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what he's saying,' said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike
[9878]6371   Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry
[9879]52   Is it true
[9880]6193   Is it Harry Potter
[9881]15021   Kreacher can see the scar, it must be true, that's the boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it-'Don't we all, Kreacher,' said Fred
[9882]335   What do you want, anyway
[9883]734  ' George asked
[9884]5770   Kreacher's huge eyes darted towards George
[9885]5220   Kreacher is cleaning,' he said evasively
[9886]11442   A likely story,' said a voice behind Harry
[9887]1213   Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf from the doorway
[9888]645    The noise in the hall had abated; perhaps Mrs
[9889]867    Weasley and Mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen
[9890]1400   At the sight of Sirius, Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor
[9891]5939   Stand up straight,' said Sirius impatiently
[9892]0    Now, what are you up to
[9893]284  'Kreacher is cleaning,' the elf repeated
[9894]16132    Kreacher lives to serve the Noble House of Black-'-and it's getting blacker every day, it's filthy,' said Sirius
[9895]14387   Master always liked his little joke,' said Kreacher, bowing again, and continuing in an undertone, Master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his mother's heart-'My mother didn't have a heart, Kreacher,' snapped Sirius
[9896]184    She kept herself alive out of pure spite
[9897]196   'Kreacher bowed again as he spoke
[9898]284   Whatever Master says,' he muttered furiously
[9899]12182    Master is not fit to wipe slime from his mother's boots, oh, my poor mistress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher serving him, how she hated him, what a disappointment he was-'I asked you what you were up to,' said Sirius coldly
[9900]3380    Every time you show up pretending to be cleaning, you sneak something off to your room so we can't throw it out
[9901]23271   'Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master's house,' said the elf, then muttered very fast, Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it's been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it-'I thought it might be that,' said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall
[9902]3676    She'll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of it, I don't doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will
[9903]462    Now go away, Kreacher
[9904]3380   'It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order; nevertheless, the look he gave Sirius as he shuffled out past him was full of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room
[9905]11342   -comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around, oh, my poor mistress, what would she say if she saw the house now, scum living in it, her treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of hers and he's back, they say he's a murderer too-'Keep muttering and I will be a murderer
[9906]6484  ' said Sirius irritably as he slammed the door shut on the elf
[9907]11756   Sirius, he's not right in the head,' Hermione pleaded, I don't think he realises we can hear him
[9908]32672   'He's been alone too long,' said Sirius, taking mad orders from my mother's portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul little-'If you could just set him free,' said Hermione hopefully, maybe-'We can't set him free, he knows too much about the Order,' said Sirius curtly
[9909]118    And anyway, the shock would kill him
[9910]257    You suggest to him that he leaves this house, see how he takes it
[9911]1812   'Sirius walked across the room to where the tapestry Kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length of the wall
[9912]5853    Harry and the others followed
[9913]1603   The tapestry looked immensely old; it was faded and looked as though doxys had gnawed it in places
[9914]6526    Nevertheless, the golden thread with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back (as far as Harry could tell) to the Middle Ages
[9915]961    Large words at the very top of the tapestry read:The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black'Toujours pur'You're not on here
[9916]10935  ' said Harry, after scanning the bottom of the tree closely
[9917]6971   I used to be there,' said Sirius, pointing at a small, round, charred hole in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn
[9918]6031    My sweet old mother blasted me off after I ran away from home- Kreacher's quite fond of muttering the story under his breath
[9919]484   'You ran away from home
[9920]5750  'When I was about sixteen,' said Sirius
[9921]621    I'd had enough
[9922]667   'Where did you go
[9923]6265  ' asked Harry, staring at him
[9924]10776   Your dad's place,' said Sirius
[9925]906    Your grandparents were really good about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son
[9926]17241    Yeah, I camped out at your dad's in the school holidays, and then when I was seventeen I got a place of my own, my Uncle Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold-he's been wiped off here too, that's probably why-anyway, after that I looked after myself
[9927]398    I was always welcome at Mr
[9928]369    and Mrs
[9929]46    Potters for Sunday lunch, though
[9930]0   'But 
[9931]0   
[9932]0   
[9933]667    why did you
[9934]0   
[9935]0   
[9936]0   
[9937]122  'Leave
[9938]1352  ' Sirius smiled bitterly and ran his fingers through his long, unkempt hair
[9939]544    Because I hated the whole lot of them: my parents, with their pure-blood mania, convinced that to be a Black made you practically royal 
[9940]0

[9942]168    my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them 
[9943]0   
[9944]0   
[9945]4750    that's him
[9946]974   'Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, at the name Regulus Black'
[9947]513    A date of death (some fifteen years previously) followed the date of birth
[9948]5985   He was younger than me,' said Sirius, and a much better son, as I was constantly reminded
[9949]10875   'But he died,' said Harry
[9950]6010   Yeah,' said Sirius
[9951]83    Stupid idiot 
[9952]0   
[9953]0   
[9954]286    he joined the Death Eaters
[9955]5   'You're kidding
[9956]9601  'Come on, Harry, haven't you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of wizards my family were
[9957]5738  ' said Sirius testily
[9958]311   Were-were your parents Death Eaters as well
[9959]1834  'No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right idea, they were all for the purification of the wizarding race, getting rid of Muggle-borns and having pure-bloods in charge
[9960]4357    They weren't alone, either, there were quite a few people, before Voldemort showed his true colours, who thought he had the right idea about things
[9961]0   
[9962]0   
[9963]0   
[9964]1415    They got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power, though
[9965]1358    But I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first
[9966]54   'Was he killed by an Auror
[9967]6100  ' Harry asked tentatively
[9968]6095   Oh, no,' said Sirius
[9969]246    No, he was murdered by Voldemort
[9970]5445    Or on Voldemort's orders, more likely; I doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed by Voldemort in person
[9971]1375    From what I found out after he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out
[9972]4340    Well, you don't just hand in your resignation to Voldemort
[9973]4930    It's a lifetime of service or death
[9974]11412   'Lunch,' said Mrs Weasley's voice
[9975]714   She was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip
[9976]1354    She was very red in the face and still looked angry
[9977]6643    The others moved over to her, eager for some food, but Harry remained with Sirius, who had bent closer to the tapestry
[9978]3281   I haven't looked at this for years

[10007]110   'You and Tonks are related
[10008]6130  ' Harry asked, surprised
[10009]6592   Oh, yeah, her mother Andromeda was my favourite cousin, said Sirius, examining the tapestry closely
[10010]5681    No, Andromeda's not on here either, look-'He pointed to another small round burn mark between two names, Bellatrix and Narcissa
[10011]6272   Andromeda's sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, so-'Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly
[10012]12033    Harry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of Andromeda's burn mark
[10013]1154    A double line of gold embroidery linked Narcissa Black with Lucius Malfoy and a single vertical gold line from their names led to the name Draco
[10014]13   You're related to the Malfoys
[10015]5860  'The pure-blood families are all interrelated,' said Sirius
[10016]1190    If you're only going to let your sons and daughters marry pure-bloods our choice is very limited; there are hardly any of us left
[10017]5791    Molly and I are cousins by marriage and Arthur's something like my second cousin once removed
[10018]10420    But there's no point looking for them on here-if ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors it's the Weasleys
[10019]11776   'But Harry was now looking at the name to the left of Andromeda's burn: Bellatrix Black, which was connected by a double line to Rodolphus Lestrange
[10020]16   Lestrange
[10021]0   
[10022]0   
[10023]10837   ' Harry said aloud
[10024]3977    The name had stirred something in his memory; he knew it from somewhere, but for a moment he couldn't think where, though it gave him an odd, creeping sensation in the pit of his stomach
[10025]5816   They're in Azkaban,' said Sirius shortly
[10026]6424   Harry looked at him curiously
[10027]6576   Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch, Junior,' said Sirius, in the same brusque voice
[10028]4780    Rodolphus's brother Rabastan was with them, too
[10029]13631   'Then Harry remembered: He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside Dumbledore's Pensieve, the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes, who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to Lord Voldemort, her pride that she had tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for her loyalty
[10030]10032   You never said she was your-'Does it matter if she's my cousin
[10031]698  ' snapped Sirius
[10032]670    As far as I'm concerned, they're not my family
[10033]4861    She's certainly not my family
[10034]2875    I haven't seen her since I was your age, unless you count a glimpse of her coming into Azkaban
[10035]2477    D'you think I'm proud of having a relative like her
[10036]25724  'Sorry,' said Harry quickly, I didn't mean-I was just surprised, that's all-'It doesn't matter, don't apologise,' Sirius mumbled
[10037]957    He turned away from the tapestry, his hands deep in his pockets
[10038]9415    I don't like being back here,' he said, staring across the drawing room
[10039]1256    I never thought I'd be stuck in this house again
[10040]5820   'Harry understood completely
[10041]1282    He knew how he would feel, when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place for ever, to return and live at number four, Privet Drive
[10042]10725   It's ideal for headquarters, of course,' Sirius said
[10043]177    My father put every security measure known to wizardkind on it when he lived here
[10044]12706    It's unplottable, so Muggles could never come and call-as if they'd ever have wanted to-and now Dumbledore's added his protection, you'd be hard put to find a safer house anywhere
[10045]7812    Dumbledore's Secret-Keeper for the Order, you know-nobody can find Headquarters unless he tells them personally where it is-that note Moody showed you last night, that was from Dumbledore
[10046]0   
[10047]0   
[10048]0   
[10049]1735   ' Sirius gave a short, bark-like laugh
[10050]374    If my parents could see the use their house was being put to now 
[10051]0   
[10052]0   
[10053]167    well, my mothers portrait should give you some idea
[10054]302   'He scowled for a moment, then sighed
[10055]3417   I wouldn't mind if I could just get out occasionally and do something useful
[10056]3388    I've asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your hearing-as Snuffles, obviously-so I can give you a bit of moral support, what d'you think
[10057]6119  'Harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet
[10058]1848    He had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening; in the excitement of being back with the people he liked best, and hearing everything that was going on, it had completely flown his mind
[10059]5618    At Sirius's words, however, the crushing sense of dread returned to him
[10060]2744    He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he would feel if they went back to Hogwarts without him
[10061]8719   Don't worry,' Sirius said
[10062]7247    Harry looked up and realised that Sirius had been watching him
[10063]6601    I'm sure they'll clear you, there's definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life
[10064]11434   'But if they do expel me,' said Harry quietly, can I come back here and live with you
[10065]697  'Sirius smiled sadly
[10066]567   We'll see
[10067]9897   'I'd feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn't have to go back to the Dursleys,' Harry pressed him
[10068]6029   They must be bad if you prefer this place,' said Sirius gloomily
[10069]3158   Hurry up, you two, or there won't be any food left,' Mrs
[10070]755    Weasley called
[10071]7709   Sirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at the tapestry, then he and Harry went to join the others
[10072]6726   Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while he emptied the glass-fronted cabinets that afternoon
[10073]358    Fortunately for him, it was a job that required a lot of concentration, as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves
[10074]2085    Sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox; within seconds his bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove
[10075]10804   It's OK,' he said, examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal, must be Wartcap powder in there
[10076]7303   'He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets; Harry saw George wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already doxy-filled pocket
[10077]12971   They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry's arm like a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his skin
[10078]5666    Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature's Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy
[10079]6999    There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy, until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut; a heavy locket that none of them could open; a number of ancient seals; and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius's grandfather for services to the Ministry'
[10080]6168   It means he gave them a load of gold,' said Sirius contemptuously throwing the medal into the rubbish sack
[10081]1901   Several times Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses every time they caught him at it
[10082]9044    When Sirius wrested a large golden ring bearing the Black crest from his grip, Kreacher actually burst into furious tears and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling Sirius names Harry had never heard before
[10083]10639   It was my father's,' said Sirius, throwing the ring into the sack
[10084]8102    Kreacher wasn't quite as devoted to him as to my mother, but I still caught him snogging a pair of my father's old trousers last week
[10085]369   'Mrs
[10086]1031    Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days
[10087]766    The drawing room took three days to decontaminate
[10088]1217    Finally, the only undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree, which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall, and the rattling writing desk
[10089]620    Moody had not dropped by headquarters yet, so they could not be sure what was inside it
[10090]5669   They moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the ground floor where they found spiders as large as saucers lurking in the dresser (Ron left the room hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for an hour and a half)
[10091]1623    The china, which bore the Black crest and motto, was all thrown unceremoniously into a sack by Sirius, and the same fate met a set of old photographs in tarnished silver frames, all of whose occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them smashed
[10092]12127   Snape might refer to their work as cleaning', but in Harry's opinion they were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher
[10093]547    The house-elf kept appearing wherever they were congregated, his muttering becoming more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish sacks
[10094]9095    Sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said, Master must do as Master wishes,' before turning away and muttering very loudly, but Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he is plotting against the Dark Lord, yes, with these Mudblood and traitors and scum
[10095]0   
[10096]0   
[10097]0   
[10098]7739   'At which Sirius, ignoring Hermione's protests, seized Kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room
[10099]12468   The doorbell rang several times a day, which was the cue for Sirius's mother to start shrieking again, and for Harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on the visitor, though they gleaned very little from the brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to sneak before Mrs
[10100]643    Weasley recalled them to their tasks
[10101]20394    Snape flitted in and out of the house several times more, though to Harry's relief they never came face to face; Harry also caught sight of his Transfiguration teacher, Professor McGonagall, looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, and she also seemed too busy to linger
[10102]166    Sometimes, however, the visitors stayed to help
[10103]2571    Tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the house with Sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious work for the Order, helped them repair a grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at passers-by
[10104]594    Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in Mrs
[10105]8382    Weasley's eyes by rescuing Ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe
[10106]6918   Despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly, still having dreams about corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle, Harry was managing to have fun for the first time all summer
[10107]1808    As long as he was busy he was happy; when the action abated, however, whenever he dropped his guard, or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling, the thought of the looming Ministry hearing returned to him
[10108]1416    Fear jabbed at his insides like needles as he wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled
[10109]5690    The idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud, not even to Ron and Hermione, who, though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in his direction, followed his lead in not mentioning it
[10110]778    Sometimes, he could not prevent his imagination showing him a faceless Ministry official who was snapping his wand in two and ordering him back to the Dursleys' 
[10111]0   
[10112]0   
[10113]0    but he would not go
[10114]32    He was determined on that
[10115]1334    He would come back here to Grimmauld Place and live with Sirius
[10116]790   He felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when Mrs
[10117]13578    Weasley turned to him during dinner on Wednesday evening and said quietly, I've ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning, Harry, and I want you to wash your hair tonight, too
[10118]478    A good first impression can work wonders
[10119]5699   'Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny all stopped talking and looked over at him
[10120]6151    Harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chop, but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew
[10121]113   How am I getting there
[10122]725  ' he asked Mrs
[10123]976    Weasley, trying to sound unconcerned
[10124]10499   Arthur's taking you to work with him,' said Mrs
[10125]662    Weasley gently
[10126]372   Mr
[10127]6616    Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the table
[10128]10702   You can wait in my office until it's time for the hearing,' he said
[10129]7586   Harry looked over at Sirius, but before he could ask the question, Mrs
[10130]652    Weasley had answered it
[10131]22532   Professor Dumbledore doesn't think it's a good idea for Sirius to go with you, and I must say I-'-think he's quite right,' said Sirius through clenched teeth
[10132]369   Mrs
[10133]663    Weasley pursed her lips
[10134]1816   When did Dumbledore tell you that
[10135]11642  ' Harry said, staring at Sirius
[10136]6047   He came last night, when you were in bed,' said Mr
[10137]636    Weasley
[10138]670   Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork
[10139]6274    Harry lowered his own eyes to his plate
[10140]2051    The thought that Dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel, if it were possible, even worse

[10154]6453     Harry awoke at half-past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear
[10155]691    For a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the disciplinary hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses
[10156]369    Mrs
[10157]3241    Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his bed
[10158]5749    Harry scrambled into them
[10159]225    The blank picture on the wall sniggered
[10160]2696   Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast asleep
[10161]7622    He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out on to the landing and closed the door softly behind him
[10162]15098    Trying not to think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of Kreacher's ancestors, and down into the kitchen
[10163]1024   He had expected it to be empty, but when he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side
[10164]990    He pushed it open and saw Mr
[10165]369    and Mrs
[10166]1759    Weasley, Sirius, Lupin, and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him
[10167]407    All were fully dressed except Mrs
[10168]770    Weasley, who was wearing a quilted purple dressing gown
[10169]6367    She leapt to her feet the moment Harry entered
[10170]5789   Breakfast,' she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire
[10171]6828   M-m-morning, Harry,' yawned Tonks
[10172]290    Her hair was blonde and curly this morning
[10173]596    Sleep all right
[10174]11095  'Yeah,' said Harry
[10175]6017   I've b-b-been up all night,' she said, with another shuddering yawn

[10204]1664    Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was like chewing carpet
[10205]3622    Mrs Weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out the creases across his shoulders

[10218]1234    Weasley was not wearing wizards' robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket
[10219]6167    He turned from Tonks to Harry
[10220]168   How are you feeling
[10221]5749  'Harry shrugged
[10222]1013   It'll all be over soon,' Mr
[10223]5730    Weasley said bracingly
[10224]1199    In a few hours' time you'll be cleared
[10225]10818   'Harry said nothing
[10226]10053   The hearing's on my floor, in Amelia Bones's office
[10227]10756    She's Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and she's the one who'll be questioning you
[10228]11062   'Amelia Bones is OK, Harry,' said Tonks earnestly
[10229]5517    She's fair, she'll hear you out
[10230]6654   'Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say
[10231]8742   Don't lose your temper,' said Sirius abruptly
[10232]28    Be polite and stick to the facts
[10233]5790   'Harry nodded again
[10234]10154   The law's on your side,' said Lupin quietly

[10236]11814   'Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry's neck; for a moment he thought someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm on him, then he realised that Mrs
[10237]834    Weasley was attacking his hair with a wet comb
[10238]685    She pressed hard on the top of his head

[10246]11317   'OK,' said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to his feet
[10247]12169   You'll be all right, Harry,' said Tonks, patting him on the arm
[10248]5616   Good luck,' said Lupin

[10292]6839   They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard (Harry handled the transaction, as Mr
[10293]1430    Weasley was not very good with Muggle money) and five minutes later they were boarding an underground train that rattled them off towards the centre of London
[10294]372    Mr
[10295]909    Weasley kept anxiously checking and re-checking the Underground Map above the windows
[10296]5736   Four stops, Harry 
[10297]0   
[10298]0   
[10299]279    three stops left now 
[10300]0   
[10301]0   
[10302]5736    two stops to go, Harry
[10303]0   
[10304]0   
[10305]998   'They got off at a station in the very heart of London, and were swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases
[10306]596    Up the escalator they went, through the ticket barrier (Mr
[10307]1758    Weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged on to a broad street lined with imposing-looking buildings and already full of traffic
[10308]0   Where are we
[10309]5458  ' said Mr
[10310]8327    Weasley blankly, and for one heart-stopping moment Harry thought they had got off at the wrong station despite Mr
[10311]11113    Weasley's continual references to the map; but a second later he said, Ah yes 
[10312]0   
[10313]0   
[10314]6158    this way, Harry,' and led him down a side road
[10315]5895   Sorry,' he said, but I never come by train and it all looks rather different from a Muggle perspective
[10316]1016    As a matter of fact, I've never even used the visitors' entrance before
[10317]1046   'The further they walked, the smaller and less imposing the buildings became, until finally they reached a street that contained several rather shabby-looking offices, a pub and an overflowing skip
[10318]6218    Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry of Magic
[10319]5458   Here we are,' said Mr
[10320]1562    Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red telephone box, which was missing several panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffitied wall
[10321]5732    After you, Harry
[10322]720   'He opened the telephone-box door
[10323]6068   Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about
[10324]372    Mr
[10325]6983    Weasley folded himself in beside Harry and closed the door
[10326]6136    It was a tight fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off
[10327]372    Mr
[10328]6659    Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver
[10329]372   Mr
[10330]12168    Weasley, I think this might be out of order, too,' Harry said
[10331]6201   No, no, I'm sure its fine,' said Mr
[10332]1249    Weasley, holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial
[10333]5070    Let's see

[10336]0    six

[10342]0    four

[10348]0    and another two
[10349]0   
[10350]0   
[10351]1481   'As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr
[10352]6680    Weasley's hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing right beside them
[10353]458   Welcome to the Ministry of Magic
[10354]55    Please state your name and business
[10355]121   'Er
[10356]0   
[10357]0   
[10358]5458   ' said Mr
[10359]834    Weasley, clearly uncertain whether or not he should talk into the receiver
[10360]7764    He compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear, Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, here to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing
[10361]0   
[10362]0   
[10363]0   
[10364]5718   'Thank you,' said the cool female voice
[10365]194    Visitor, please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes
[10366]6292   'There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared
[10367]6436    He picked it up: it was a square silver badge with Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hearing on it
[10368]2947    He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again
[10369]1550   Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium 'The floor of the telephone box shuddered
[10370]260    They were sinking slowly into the ground
[10371]6425    Harry watched apprehensively as the pavement seemed to rise up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads
[10372]739    Then he could see nothing at all; he could hear only a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth
[10373]7927    After about a minute, though it felt much longer to Harry, a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and, widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes watering
[10374]11044   The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day,' said the woman's voice
[10375]1182   The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr
[10376]7002    Weasley stepped out of it, followed by Harry, whose mouth had fallen open
[10377]1608   They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished, dark wood floor
[10378]1251    The peacock blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that kept moving and changing like some enormous heavenly noticeboard
[10379]5414    The wall's on each side were panelled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them
[10380]2072    Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the left-hand fireplaces with a soft whoosh; on the right-hand side, short queues were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart
[10381]269   Halfway down the hall was a fountain
[10382]508    A group of golden statues, larger than life-size, stood in the middle of a circular pool
[10383]1523    Tallest of them all was a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air
[10384]470    Grouped around him were a beautiful witch, a centaur, a goblin and a house-elf
[10385]837    The last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and wizard
[10386]16648    Glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of the two wands, the point of the centaur's arrow, the tip of the goblin's hat, and each of the house-elf's ears, so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of the Apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards, most of whom were wearing glum, early-morning looks, strode towards a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall
[10387]5813   This way,' said Mr
[10388]636    Weasley
[10389]1142   They joined the throng, wending their way between the Ministry workers, some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment, others battered briefcases, still others were reading the Daily Prophet while they walked
[10390]6315    As they passed the fountain Harry saw silver Sickles and bronze Knuts glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool
[10391]590    A small smudged sign beside it read:All proceeds from the fountain of magical brethren will be given to St
[10392]12116    Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and InjuriesIf I'm not expelled from Hogwarts, I'll put in ten Galleons, Harry found himself thinking desperately
[10393]11190   Over here, Harry,' said Mr
[10394]1032    Weasley, and they stepped out of the stream of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates
[10395]1859    Seated at a desk to the left, beneath a sign saying SECURITY, a badly-shaven wizard in peacock-blue robes looked up as they approached and put down his Daily Prophet
[10396]5905   I'm escorting a visitor,' said Mr
[10397]6377    Weasley, gesturing towards Harry
[10398]5829   Step over here,' said the wizard in a bored voice
[10399]17267   Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down Harry's front and back
[10400]6875   Wand,' grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the golden instrument and holding out his hand
[10401]6150   Harry produced his wand
[10402]1826    The wizard dropped it on to a strange brass instrument, which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish
[10403]122    It began to vibrate
[10404]387    A narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base
[10405]336    The wizard tore this off and read the writing on it
[10406]383   Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years
[10407]16    That correct
[10408]11151  'Yes,' said Harry nervously
[10409]5529   I keep this,' said the wizard, impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike
[10410]6244    You get this back,' he added, thrusting the wand at Harry
[10411]40   Thank you
[10412]18   'Hang on
[10413]0   
[10414]0   
[10415]0   
[10416]5359   ' said the wizard slowly
[10417]15952   His eyes had darted from the silver visitor's badge on Harry's chest to his forehead
[10418]5501   Thank you, Eric,' said Mr
[10419]7292    Weasley firmly, and grasping Harry by the shoulder he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates
[10420]6483   Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr
[10421]1090    Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles
[10422]6104    Harry and Mr
[10423]762    Weasley joined the crowd around one of them
[10424]757    Nearby, stood a big bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box which was emitting rasping noises
[10425]623   All right, Arthur
[10426]5629  ' said the wizard, nodding at Mr
[10427]636    Weasley
[10428]1384   What've you got there, Bob
[10429]728  ' asked Mr
[10430]1274    Weasley, looking at the box
[10431]5493   We're not sure,' said the wizard seriously
[10432]562    We thought it was a bog-standard chicken until it started breathing fire
[10433]840    Looks like a serious breach of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me
[10434]6539   'With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them; the golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr
[10435]6807    Weasley stepped into the lift with the rest of the crowd and Harry found himself jammed against the back wall
[10436]6737    Several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously; he stared at his feet to avoid catching anyone's eye, flattening his fringe as he did so
[10437]7065    The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly, chains rattling, while the same cool female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again
[10438]652   Level Seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorporating the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club and Ludicrous Patents Office
[10439]7024   'The lift doors opened; Harry glimpsed an untidy-looking corridor, with various posters of Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls
[10440]404    One of the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor
[10441]6170    The doors closed, the lift juddered upwards again and the woman's voice announced:Level Six, Department of Magical Transportation, incorporating the Floo Network Authority, Broom Regulatory Control, Portkey Office, and Apparation Test Centre
[10442]1785   'Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got out; at the same time, several paper aeroplanes swooped into the lift
[10443]6942    Harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head; they were a pale violet colour and he could see MINISTRY OF MAGIC stamped along the edge of their wings
[10444]1200   Just inter-departmental memos,' Mr
[10445]743    Weasley muttered to him
[10446]252    We used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable 
[10447]0   
[10448]0   
[10449]27    droppings all over the desks

[10454]666   'When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few more of the witches and wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that the light from the lamp flickered and flashed overhead as they darted around it
[10455]504   Level Four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau
[10456]10697   ' S'cuse,' said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos
[10457]207    The doors clanged shut yet again
[10458]610   Level Three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters, and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee
[10459]996   'Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr
[10460]7325    Weasley, Harry, and a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing on the floor
[10461]997    The remaining memos continued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upwards again, then the doors opened and the voice made its announcement
[10462]800   Level Two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services
[10463]11190   'This is us, Harry,' said Mr
[10464]1113    Weasley, and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors
[10465]440    My office is on the other side of the floor
[10466]372   'Mr
[10467]14139    Weasley,' said Harry, as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming, aren't we still underground
[10468]5750  'Yes, we are,' said Mr
[10469]636    Weasley
[10470]71    Those are enchanted windows
[10471]867    Magical Maintenance decide what weather we'll get every day
[10472]632    We had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay rise

[10474]0   
[10475]0   
[10476]6665    Just round here, Harry
[10477]1290   'They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors and emerged in a cluttered open area divided into cubicles, which was buzzing with talk and laughter
[10478]760    Memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets
[10479]289    A lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read AUROR HEADQUARTERS
[10480]6528   Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed
[10481]773    The Aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything From pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families, to posters of their favourite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet
[10482]5321    A scarlet-robed man with a ponytail longer than Bill's was sitting with his boots up on his desk, dictating a report to his quill
[10483]901    A little further along, a witch with a patch over one eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt
[10484]5940   Morning, Weasley,' said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer
[10485]1644    I've been wanting a word with you, have you got a second
[10486]6199  'Yes, if it really is a second,' said Mr
[10487]1113    Weasley, I'm in rather a hurry
[10488]7273   'They were talking as though they hardly knew each other and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr
[10489]228    Weasly stood on his foot
[10490]214    They followed Kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle
[10491]11787   Harry received a slight shock; blinking down at him from every direction was Sirius's face
[10492]1155    Newspaper cuttings and old photographs-even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters' wedding-papered the walls
[10493]1924    The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels
[10494]5506   Here,' said Kingsley brusquely to Mr
[10495]1120    Weasley, shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand
[10496]469    I need as much information as possible on flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months
[10497]1215    We've received information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle
[10498]6014   'Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper, Give him the magazine, he might find it interesting
[10499]9183   ' Then he said in normal tones, And don't take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month
[10500]6419   'If you had read my report you would know that the term is firearms",' said Mr
[10501]662    Weasley coolly
[10502]1490    And I'm afraid you'll have to wait for information on motorcycles; we're extremely busy at the moment
[10503]10988   ' He dropped his voice and said, If you can get away before seven, Molly's making meatballs
[10504]15627   'He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley's cubicle, through a second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left, marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading Misuse of Muggle Artefacts
[10505]372   Mr
[10506]5821    Weasley's dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard
[10507]411    Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely space to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files
[10508]842    The little wall space available bore witness to Mr
[10509]10470    Weasley's obsessions; there were several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine, two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle children's books, and a diagram showing how to wire a plug
[10510]497   Sitting on top of Mr
[10511]6039    Weasley's overflowing in-tray was an old toaster that was hiccoughing in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs
[10512]895    A photograph of the Weasley family stood beside the in-tray
[10513]6177    Harry noticed that Percy appeared to have walked out of it
[10514]8747   We haven't got a window,' said Mr
[10515]898    Weasley apologetically, taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair
[10516]4735    We've asked, but they don't seem to think we need one
[10517]8674    Have a seat, Harry, doesn't look as if Perkins is in yet
[10518]11124   'Harry squeezed himself into the chair behind Perkins's desk while Mr
[10519]897    Weasley riffled through the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shacklebolt had given him
[10520]5568   Ah,' he said, grinning, as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled The Quibbler from its midst, yes
[10521]0   
[10522]0   
[10523]12   ' He flicked through it
[10524]12126    Yes, he's right, I'm sure Sirius will find that very amusing-oh dear, what's this now
[10525]1702  'A memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccoughing toaster
[10526]372    Mr
[10527]992    Weasley unfolded it and read aloud, "Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal Green, kindly investigate immediately
[10528]124    This is getting ridiculous 
[10529]0   
[10530]0   
[10531]33   'A regurgitating toilet
[10532]5571  'Anti-Muggle pranksters,' said Mr
[10533]677    Weasley, frowning
[10534]173    We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle
[10535]229    Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing-well, you can imagine
[10536]1810    The poor things keep calling in those-pumbles, I think they're called-you know, the ones who mend pipes and things
[10537]2   'Plumbers
[10538]611  '-exactly, yes, but of course they're flummoxed
[10539]5043    I only hope we can catch whoever's doing it
[10540]62   'Will it be Aurors who catch them
[10541]6880  'Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it'll be the ordinary Magical Law Enforcement Patrol-ah, Harry, this is Perkins
[10542]2564   'A stooped, timid-looking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just entered the room, panting
[10543]428   Oh, Arthur
[10544]11456  ' he said desperately, without looking at Harry
[10545]3695    Thank goodness, I didn't know what to do for the best, whether to wait here for you or not
[10546]9244    I've just sent an owl to your home but you've obviously missed it-an urgent message came ten minutes ago-'I know about the regurgitating toilet,' said Mr
[10547]636    Weasley
[10548]26992   No, no, it's not the toilet, it's the Potter boy's hearing-they've changed the time and venue-it starts at eight o'clock now and it's down in old Courtroom Ten-'Down in old- but they told me-Merlin's beard-'Mr
[10549]1878    Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp and leapt from his chair
[10550]5964   Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago
[10551]398  'Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr
[10552]6994    Weasley left the office at a run, Harry close on his heels
[10553]583   Why have they changed the time
[10554]11694  ' Harry said breathlessly, as they hurtled past the Auror cubicles; people poked out their heads and stared as they streaked past
[10555]11201    Harry felt as though he had left all his insides back at Perkins's desk
[10556]2234   I've no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, if you'd missed it, it would have been catastrophic
[10557]372  'Mr
[10558]736    Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the down' button
[10559]436   Come ON
[10560]356  'The lift clattered into view and they hurried inside
[10561]1048    Every time it stopped Mr
[10562]775    Weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine button
[10563]8136   Those courtrooms haven't been used in years,' said Mr
[10564]719    Weasley angrily
[10565]3089    I can't think why they're doing it down there-unless-but no
[10566]0   
[10567]0   
[10568]919   'A plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment, and Mr
[10569]1306    Weasley did not elaborate
[10570]11958   The Atrium,' said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid open, showing Harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain
[10571]2156    The plump witch got out and a sallow-skinned wizard with a very mournful face got in
[10572]5953   Morning, Arthur,' he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to descend
[10573]2941    Don't often see you down here

[10575]0   
[10576]0   
[10577]5531   'Urgent business, Bode,' said Mr
[10578]6794    Weasley, who was bouncing on the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at Harry
[10579]11199   Ah, yes,' said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly
[10580]217    Of course
[10581]6870   'Harry barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but his unfaltering gaze did not make him feel any more comfortable
[10582]6065   Department of Mysteries,' said the cool female voice, and left it at that
[10583]11231   Quick, Harry,' said Mr
[10584]1399    Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above
[10585]996    The walls were bare; there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set at the very end of the corridor
[10586]6214    Harry expected them to go through it, but instead Mr
[10587]1234    Weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left, where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps
[10588]387   Down here, down here,' panted Mr
[10589]1387    Weasley, taking two steps at a time
[10590]3028    The lift doesn't even come down this far 
[10591]0   
[10592]0   
[10593]182    why they're doing it down there
[10594]0   
[10595]0   
[10596]6411   'They reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor, which bore a great resemblance to the one that led to Snape's dungeon at Hogwarts, with rough stone walls and torches in brackets
[10597]334    The doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholes

[10634]5917     Harry gasped; he could not help himself
[10635]365    The large dungeon he had entered was horribly familiar
[10636]183    He had not only seen it before, he had been here before
[10637]6388    This was the place he had visited inside Dumbledore's Pensieve, the place where he had watched the Lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban
[10638]555   The walls were made of dark stone, dimly lit by torches
[10639]154    Empty benches rose on either side of him, but ahead, in the highest benches of all, were many shadowy figures
[10640]6928    They had been talking in low voices, but as the heavy door swung closed behind Harry an ominous silence fell
[10641]691   A cold male voice rang across the courtroom
[10642]44   You're late
[10643]10954   'Sorry,' said Harry nervously
[10644]4062    I-I didn't know the time had been changed
[10645]10423   'That is not the Wizengamot's fault,' said the voice
[10646]282    An owl was sent to you this morning
[10647]61    Take your seat
[10648]6544   'Harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the centre of the room, the arms of which were covered in chains
[10649]411    He had seen those chains spring to life and bind whoever sat between them
[10650]748    His footsteps echoed loudly as he walked across the stone floor
[10651]981    When he sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the chains clinked threateningly, but did not bind him
[10652]1228    Feeling rather sick, he looked up at the people seated at the bench above
[10653]1543   There were about fifty of them, all, as far as he could see, wearing plum-coloured robes with an elaborately worked silver W' on the left-hand side of the chest and all staring down their noses at him, some with very austere expressions, others looks of frank curiosity
[10654]752   In the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic
[10655]6498    Fudge was a portly man who often sported a lime-green bowler hat, though today he had dispensed with it; he had dispensed too with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to Harry
[10656]1501    A broad, square-jawed witch with very short grey hair sat on Fudges left; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding
[10657]1475    On Fudges right was another witch, but she was sitting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadow
[10658]5283   Very well,' said Fudge
[10659]428    The accused being present-finally-let us begin
[10660]80    Are you ready
[10661]163  ' he called down the row
[10662]12086   Yes, sir,' said an eager voice Harry knew
[10663]7271    Ron's brother Percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench
[10664]6848    Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came
[10665]6001    Percy's eyes, behind his horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a quill poised in his hand
[10666]13167   Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,' said Fudge in a ringing voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, into offences committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey
[10667]1937   Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister for Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister
[10668]14050    Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley-'-Witness for the defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,' said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck
[10669]2078   Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long midnight-blue robes and a perfectly calm expression
[10670]7702    His long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose
[10671]95   The members of the Wizengamot were muttering
[10672]1297    All eyes were now on Dumbledore
[10673]1306    Some looked annoyed, others slightly frightened; two elderly witches in the back row, however, raised their hands and waved in welcome
[10674]12728   A powerful emotion had risen in Harry's chest at the sight of Dumbledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him
[10675]8445    He wanted to catch Dumbledore's eye, but Dumbledore was not looking his way; he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered Fudge
[10676]6042   Ah,' said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted
[10677]817    Dumbledore
[10678]292    Yes
[10679]1913    You-er-got our-er- message that the time and-er-place of the hearing had been changed, then
[10680]5941  'I must have missed it,' said Dumbledore cheerfully
[10681]434    However, due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done
[10682]1852   'Yes-well-I suppose we'll need another chair-I-Weasley, could you-
[10683]13001  'Not to worry, not to worry,' said Dumbledore pleasantly; he took out his wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to Harry
[10684]1665    Dumbledore sat down, put the tips of his long fingers together and surveyed Fudge over them with an expression of polite interest
[10685]1009    The Wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly; only when Fudge spoke again did they settle down
[10686]5613   Yes,' said Fudge again, shuffling his notes
[10687]0    Well, then
[10688]0    So
[10689]9    The charges
[10690]292    Yes
[10691]3000   'He extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him, took a deep breath, and read out, The charges against the accused are as follows: That he did knowingly, deliberately and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions, having received a previous written warning from the Ministry of Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus Charm in a Muggle-inhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on the second of August at twenty-three minutes past nine, which constitutes an offence under Paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, and also under Section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks' Statute of Secrecy
[10692]6721   You are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey
[10693]11155  ' Fudge said, glaring at Harry over the top of his parchment
[10694]11110   Yes,' Harry said
[10695]1457   You received an official warning from the Ministry for using illegal magic three years ago, did you not
[10696]685  'Yes, but-'And yet you conjured a Patronus on the night of the second of August
[10697]5283  ' said Fudge
[10698]11844   Yes,' said Harry, but-'Knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of seventeen
[10699]377  'Yes, but-'Knowing that you were in an area full of Muggles
[10700]1096  'Yes, but-'Fully aware that you were in close proximity to a Muggle at the time
[10701]11945  'Yes,' said Harry angrily, but I only used it because we were-'The witch with the monocle cut across him in a booming voice
[10702]54   You produced a fully-fledged Patronus
[10703]11135  'Yes,' said Harry, because-'A corporeal Patronus
[10704]0  'A-what
[10705]10818  ' said Harry
[10706]124   Your Patronus had a clearly defined form
[10707]538   I mean to say, it was more than vapour or smoke
[10708]20984  'Yes,' said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate, it's a stag, it's always a stag
[10709]0   'Always
[10710]143  ' boomed Madam Bones
[10711]32    You have produced a Patronus before now
[10712]12163  'Yes,' said Harry, I've been doing it for over a year
[10713]356   'And you are fifteen years old
[10714]539  'Yes, and-'You learned this at school
[10715]6920  'Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, because of the-'Impressive,' said Madam Bones, staring down at him, a true Patronus at his age 
[10716]0   
[10717]0   
[10718]12    very impressive indeed
[10719]437   'Some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again; a few nodded, but others were frowning and shaking their heads
[10720]12416   It's not a question of how impressive the magic was,' said Fudge in a testy voice, in fact, the more impressive the worse it is, I would have thought, given that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle
[10721]11099  'Those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement, but it was the sight of Percy's sanctimonious little nod that goaded Harry into speech
[10722]750   I did it because of the dementors
[10723]5229  ' he said loudly, before anyone could interrupt him again
[10724]308   He had expected more muttering, but the silence that fell seemed to be somehow denser than before
[10725]83   Dementors
[10726]6312  ' said Madam Bones after a moment, her thick eyebrows rising until her monocle looked in danger of falling out
[10727]363    What do you mean, boy
[10728]552  'I mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousin
[10729]6104  'Ah,' said Fudge again, smirking unpleasantly as he looked around at the Wizengamot, as though inviting them to share the joke
[10730]292    Yes
[10731]2098    Yes, I thought we'd be hearing something like this
[10732]388   'Dementors in Little Whinging
[10733]5555  ' Madam Bones said, in a tone of great surprise
[10734]5976    I don't understand-'Don't you, Amelia
[10735]5306  ' said Fudge, still smirking
[10736]358    Let me explain
[10737]5665    He's been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a very nice little cover story, very nice indeed
[10738]2571    Muggles can't see dementors, can they, boy
[10739]70   Highly convenient, highly convenient 
[10740]0   
[10741]0   
[10742]5644    so it's just your word and no witnesses
[10743]0   
[10744]0   
[10745]0   
[10746]524   'I'm not lying
[10747]11009  ' said Harry loudly, over another outbreak of muttering from the court
[10748]1176    There were two of them, coming from opposite ends of the alley everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it-'Enough, enough
[10749]6262  ' said Fudge, with a very supercilious look on his face
[10750]2156    I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story-'Dumbledore cleared his throat
[10751]221    The Wizengamot fell silent again
[10752]5695   We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of dementors in that alleyway,' he said, other than Dudley Dursley, I mean
[10753]6012   'Fudge's plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let air out of it
[10754]11556    He stared down at Dumbledore for a moment or two, then, with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together, said, We haven't got time to listen to more tarradiddles, I'm afraid, Dumbledore
[10755]7408    I want this dealt with quickly-'I may be wrong,' said Dumbledore pleasantly, but I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case
[10756]2746   Isn't that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones
[10757]183  ' he continued, addressing the witch in the monocle
[10758]5280   True,' said Madam Bones
[10759]87    Perfectly true
[10760]610   'Oh, very well, very well,' snapped Fudge
[10761]79    Where is this person
[10762]5943  'I brought her with me,' said Dumbledore
[10763]6184    She's just outside the door
[10764]0    Should I-
[10765]13467  'No-Weasley, you go,' Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at once, ran down the stone steps from the judge's balcony and hurried past Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them
[10766]1064   A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs
[10767]41    Figg
[10768]712    She looked scared and more batty than ever
[10769]6194    Harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippers
[10770]1570   Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs
[10771]316    Figg his chair, conjuring a second one for himself
[10772]0   Full name
[10773]5788  ' said Fudge loudly, when Mrs
[10774]204    Figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat
[10775]5498   Arabella Doreen Figg,' said Mrs
[10776]582    Figg in her quavery voice
[10777]101   And who exactly are you
[10778]5843  ' said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice
[10779]12510   I'm a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter lives,' said Mrs
[10780]41    Figg
[10781]11993   We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging, other than Harry Potter,' said Madam Bones at once
[10782]147    That situation has always been closely monitored, given 
[10783]0   
[10784]0   
[10785]239    given past events
[10786]5908   'I'm a Squib,' said Mrs
[10787]41    Figg
[10788]2425    So you wouldn't have me registered, would you
[10789]40  'A Squib, eh
[10790]5356  ' said Fudge, eyeing her closely
[10791]587    We'll be checking that
[10792]1347    You'll leave details of your parentage with my assistant, Weasley
[10793]87    Incidentally, can Squibs see dementors
[10794]1558  ' he added, looking left and right along the bench
[10795]292   Yes, we can
[10796]5455  ' said Mrs
[10797]58    Figg indignantly
[10798]1040   Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised
[10799]5087    Very well,' he said aloofly
[10800]63    What is your story
[10801]1412  'I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of Wisteria Walk, around about nine o'clock, on the evening of the second of August,' gabbled Mrs
[10802]633    Figg at once, as though she had learned what she was saying by heart, when I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk
[10803]746    On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I saw dementors running-'Running
[10804]5283  ' said Madam Bones sharply
[10805]3096    Dementors don't run, they glide
[10806]10521   'That's what I meant to say,' said Mrs
[10807]274    Figg quickly, patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks
[10808]1477    Gliding along the alley towards what looked like two boys
[10809]1858   'What did they look like
[10810]5818  ' said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes so that the edge of the monocle disappeared into her flesh
[10811]5495   Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny-'No, no,' said Madam Bones impatiently
[10812]83    The dementors 
[10813]0   
[10814]0   
[10815]0    describe them
[10816]5987   'Oh,' said Mrs Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now
[10817]57    They were big
[10818]139    Big and wearing cloaks
[10819]6160   'Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach
[10820]369    Whatever Mrs
[10821]2366    Figg might say, it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor, and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way they moved, hovering inches over the ground, or the rotting smell of them, or that terrible rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air
[10822]0   
[10823]0   
[10824]0   
[10825]1151   In the second row, a dumpy wizard with a large black moustache leaned close to whisper in the ear of his neighbour, a frizzy-haired witch
[10826]70    She smirked and nodded
[10827]568   Big and wearing cloaks,' repeated Madam Bones coolly, while Fudge snorted derisively
[10828]0    I see
[10829]0    Anything else
[10830]5788  'Yes,' said Mrs Figg
[10831]280    I felt them
[10832]5349    Everything went cold, and this was a very warm summer's night, mark you
[10833]280    And I felt 
[10834]0   
[10835]0   
[10836]201    as though all happiness had gone from the world 
[10837]0   
[10838]0   
[10839]41    and I remembered 
[10840]0   
[10841]0   
[10842]155    dreadful things
[10843]0   
[10844]0   
[10845]0   
[10846]662   'Her voice shook and died
[10847]5545   Madam Bones's eyes widened slightly
[10848]5852    Harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it
[10849]750   What did the dementors do
[10850]6453  ' she asked, and Harry felt a rush of hope
[10851]5682   They went for the boys,' said Mrs
[10852]1518    Figg, her voice stronger and more confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face
[10853]24    One of them had fallen
[10854]608    The other was backing away, trying to repel the dementor
[10855]5732    That was Harry
[10856]263    He tried twice and produced only silver vapour
[10857]631    On the third attempt, he produced a Patronus, which charged down the first dementor and then, with his encouragement, chased the second one away from his cousin
[10858]0    And that 
[10859]0   
[10860]0   
[10861]512    that is what happened,' Mrs
[10862]125    Figg finished, somewhat lamely
[10863]1187   Madam Bones looked down at Mrs
[10864]123    Figg in silence
[10865]820    Fudge was not looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers
[10866]10830    Finally, he raised his eyes and said, rather aggressively, That's what you saw, is it
[10867]512  'That is what happened,' Mrs
[10868]94    Figg repeated
[10869]5283   Very well,' said Fudge
[10870]0    You may go
[10871]369   'Mrs
[10872]2765    Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to Dumbledore, then got up and shuffled off towards the door
[10873]6123    Harry heard it thud shut behind her
[10874]5301   Not a very convincing witness,' said Fudge loftily
[10875]9850   Oh, I don't know,' said Madam Bones, in her booming voice
[10876]132    She certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately
[10877]4957    And I can't imagine why she would say they were there if they weren't
[10878]1615   'But dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard
[10879]207  ' snorted Fudge
[10880]356    The odds on that must be very, very long
[10881]12430    Even Bagman wouldn't have bet-'Oh, I don't think any of us believe the dementors were there by coincidence,' said Dumbledore lightly
[10882]1987   The witch sitting to the right of Fudge, with her face in shadow, moved slightly but everyone else was quite still and silent
[10883]323   And what is that supposed to mean
[10884]555  ' Fudge asked icily
[10885]6521   It means that I think they were ordered there,' said Dumbledore
[10886]1035   I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging
[10887]212  ' barked Fudge
[10888]6664   Not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these days,' said Dumbledore calmly
[10889]205    I have already given you my views on this matter, Cornelius
[10890]6554   'Yes, you have,' said Fudge forcefully, and I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore
[10891]633    The dementors remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to
[10892]6842   'Then,' said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, we must ask ourselves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of August
[10893]7778   'In the complete silence that greeted these words, the witch to the right of Fudge leaned forwards so that Harry saw her for the first time
[10894]2889   He thought she looked just like a large, pale toad
[10895]1461    She was rather squat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon and a very wide, slack mouth
[10896]996    Her eyes were large, round and slightly bulging
[10897]1643    Even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue
[10898]6080   The Chair recognises Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister,' said Fudge
[10899]6810   The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took Harry aback; he had been expecting a croak
[10900]8369   I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor Dumbledore,' she said, with a simper that left her big, round eyes as cold as ever
[10901]18    So silly of me
[10902]964    But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy
[10903]10920  'She gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry's neck stand up
[10904]106    A few other members of the Wizengamot laughed with her
[10905]297    It could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused
[10906]13006   If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two dementors attacked Harry and his cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,' said Dumbledore politely
[10907]1153    Of course, these particular dementors may have been outside Ministry control-'There are no dementors outside Ministry control
[10908]676  ' snapped Fudge, who had turned brick red
[10909]1625   Dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow
[10910]674   Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they attacked without authorisation
[10911]1449   'It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does not do, Dumbledore
[10912]591  ' snapped Fudge, now a shade of magenta of which Uncle Vernon would have been proud
[10913]8538   Of course it isn't,' said Dumbledore mildly
[10914]144    I was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated
[10915]538   'He glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her monocle and stared back at him, frowning slightly
[10916]5148   I would remind everybody that the behaviour of these dementors, if indeed they are not figments of this boy's imagination, is not the subject of this hearing
[10917]5283  ' said Fudge
[10918]11026    We are here to examine Harry Potter's offences under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery
[10919]6273  'Of course we are,' said Dumbledore, but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant
[10920]1646    Clause Seven of the Decree states that magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances, and as those exceptional circumstances include situations which threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself, or any witches, wizards or Muggles present at the time of the-'We are familiar with Clause Seven, thank you very much
[10921]234  ' snarled Fudge
[10922]6122   Of course you are,' said Dumbledore courteously
[10923]10707    Then we are in agreement that Harry's use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances the clause describes
[10924]110  'If there were dementors, which I doubt
[10925]1110   'You have heard it from an eyewitness,' Dumbledore interrupted
[10926]80   If you still doubt her truthfulness, call her back, question her again
[10927]235    I am sure she would not object
[10928]217   'I-that-not-' blustered Fudge, fiddling with the papers before him
[10929]5966    It's-I want this over with today, Dumbledore
[10930]6351  'But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,' said Dumbledore
[10931]105   Serious miscarriage, my hat
[10932]5822  ' said Fudge at the top of his voice
[10933]2201    Have you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock-and-bull stories this boy has come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school
[10934]3926   I suppose you've forgotten the Hover Charm he used three years ago-'That wasn't me, it was a house-elf
[10935]10818  ' said Harry
[10936]0   YOU SEE
[10937]10778  ' roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry's direction
[10938]310    A house-elf
[10939]309   In a Muggle house
[10940]6852   I ask you-'The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School,' said Dumbledore
[10941]84    I can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish
[10942]3990   'I-not-I haven't got time to listen to house-elves
[10943]9635   Anyway, that's not the only-he blew up his aunt, for God's sake
[10944]5222  ' Fudge shouted, banging his fist on the judge's bench and upsetting a bottle of ink
[10945]7182   And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions,' said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes
[10946]20244   And I haven't even started on what he gets up to at school-'But, as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for misdemeanours at school, Harry's behaviour there is not relevant to this hearing,' said Dumbledore, as politely as ever, but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words
[10947]3   Oho
[10948]5283  ' said Fudge
[10949]380    Not our business what he does at school, eh
[10950]562   You think so
[10951]7076  'The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August,' said Dumbledore
[10952]1377    Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven, again, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August, in your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself
[10953]5323   'Laws can be changed,' said Fudge savagely
[10954]6614   Of course they can,' said Dumbledore, inclining his head
[10955]185    And you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius
[10956]1075    Why, in the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic
[10957]157  'A few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats
[10958]725    Fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce
[10959]2248    The toadlike witch on his right, however, merely gazed at Dumbledore, her face quite expressionless
[10960]12315   As far as I am aware,' Dumbledore continued, there is no law yet in place that says this court's job is to punish Harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed
[10961]86    He has been charged with a specific offence and he has presented his defence
[10962]3    All he and I can do now is to await your verdict
[10963]5906   'Dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more
[10964]243    Fudge glared at him, evidently incensed
[10965]8969    Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, seeking reassurance; he was not at all sure that Dumbledore was right in telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it was about time they made a decision
[10966]11544    Again, however, Dumbledore seemed oblivious to Harry's attempt to catch his eye
[10967]753    He continued to look up at the benches where the entire Wizengamot had fallen into urgent, whispered conversations
[10968]6652   Harry looked at his feet
[10969]303    His heart, which seemed to have swollen to an unnatural size, was thumping loudly under his ribs
[10970]162    He had expected the hearing to last longer than this
[10971]598    He was not at all sure that he had made a good impression
[10972]5374    He had not really said very much
[10973]491    He ought to have explained more fully about the dementors, about how he had fallen over, about how both he and Dudley had nearly been kissed
[10974]0   
[10975]0   
[10976]0   
[10977]2780   Twice he looked up at Fudge and opened his mouth to speak, but his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times he merely took a deep breath and looked back down at his shoes
[10978]142   Then the whispering stopped
[10979]6686    Harry wanted to look up at the judges, but found that it was really much, much easier to keep examining his laces
[10980]51   Those in favour of clearing the witness of all charges
[10981]5733  ' said Madam Boness booming voice
[10982]11008   Harry's head jerked upwards
[10983]333    There were hands in the air, many of them 
[10984]0   
[10985]0   
[10986]175    more than half
[10987]5516   Breathing very fast, he tried to count, but before he could finish, Madam Bones had said, And those in favour of conviction
[10988]2711  'Fudge raised his hand; so did half a dozen others, including the witch on his right and the heavily-moustached wizard and the frizzy-haired witch in the second row
[10989]1535   Fudge glanced around at them all, looking as though there was something large stuck in his throat, then lowered his own hand
[10990]5958    He took two deep breaths and said, in a voice distorted by suppressed rage, Very well, very well 
[10991]0   
[10992]0   
[10993]36    cleared of all charges
[10994]6620   'Excellent,' said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feel, pulling out his wand and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish
[10995]113    Well, I must be getting along
[10996]504    Good day to you all
[10997]6412   'And without looking once at Harry, he swept from the dungeon

[11016]407    WeasleyContents  Prev Chapter  Next Chapter  
[11017]11627     Dumbledore's abrupt departure took Harry completely by surprise
[11018]391    He remained sitting where he was in the chained chair, struggling with his feelings of shock and relief
[11019]896    The Wizengamot were all getting to their feet, talking, gathering up their papers and packing them away
[11020]5888    Harry stood up
[11021]6794    Nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention, except the toadlike witch on Fudge's right, who was now gazing down at him instead of at Dumbledore
[11022]17329    Ignoring her, he tried to catch Fudge's eye, or Madam Bones's, wanting to ask whether he was free to go, but Fudge seemed quite determined not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase, so he took a lew tentative steps towards the exit and, when nobody called him back, broke into a very fast walk
[11023]1496   He took the last lew steps at a run, wrenched open the door and almost collided with Mr
[11024]2132    Weasley, who was standing right outside, looking pale and apprehensive
[11025]15323   Dumbledore didn't say-'Cleared,' Harry said, pulling the door closed behind him, of all charges
[11026]6880  'Beaming, Mr Weasley seized Harry by the shoulders
[11027]10509   Harry, that's wonderful
[11028]7835   Well, of course, they couldn't have found you guilty, not on the evidence, but even so, I can't pretend I wasn't-'But Mr
[11029]1357    Weasley broke off, because the courtroom door had ust opened again
[11030]28    The Wizengamot were filing out
[11031]4788   Merlin's beard
[11032]376  ' exclaimed Mr
[11033]6832    Weasley wonderingly, pulling Harry aside to let them all pass
[11034]135    You were tried by the full court
[11035]11517  'I think so,' said Harry quietly
[11036]11794   One or two of the wizards nodded to Harry as they passed and a few, including Madam Bones, said, Morning, Arthur,' to Mr
[11037]1119    Weasley, but most averted their eyes
[11038]480    Cornelius Fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon
[11039]572    Fudge acted as though Mr
[11040]13113    Weasley and Harry were part of the wall, but again, the witch looked almost appraisingly at Harry as she passed
[11041]152    Last of all to pass was Percy
[11042]7733    Like Fudge, he completely ignored his father and Harry; he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills, his back rigid and his nose in the air
[11043]393    The lines around Mr
[11044]6252    Weasley's mouth tightened slightly, but other than this he gave no sign that he had seen his third son
[11045]17673   I'm going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news,' he said, beckoning Harry forwards as Percy's heels disappeared up the steps to Level Nine
[11046]1057    I'll drop you off on the way to that toilet in Bethnal Green
[11047]436    Come on
[11048]0   
[11049]0   
[11050]0   
[11051]28   'So, what will you have to do about the toilet
[11052]6131  ' Harry asked, grinning
[11053]265    Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual
[11054]813    It was starting to sink in: He was cleared, he was going back to Hogwarts
[11055]10626   Oh, it's a simple enough anti-jinx,' said Mr
[11056]16085    Weasley as they mounted the stairs, but it's not so much having to repair the damage, it's more the attitude behind the vandalism, Harry
[11057]5474    Muggle-baiting might strike some wizards as funny, but it's an expression of something much deeper and nastier, and I for one-'Mr
[11058]704    Weasley broke off in mid-sentence
[11059]3336    They had just reached the ninth-level corridor and Cornelius Fudge was standing a few feet away from them, talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a pointed, pale face
[11060]762   The second man turned at the sound of their footsteps
[11061]11753    He, too, broke off in mid-conversation, his cold grey eyes narrowed and fixed upon Harry's face
[11062]0   Well, well, well 
[11063]0   
[11064]0   
[11065]6090    Patronus Potter,' said Lucius Malfoy coolly
[11066]7004   Harry felt winded, as though he had just walked into something solid
[11067]12117    He had last seen those cold grey eyes through slits in a Death Eater's hood, and last heard that man's voice jeering in a dark graveyard while Lord Voldemort tortured him
[11068]15250    Harry could not believe that Lucius Malfoy dared look him in the face; he could not believe that he was here, in the Ministry of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talking to him, when Harry had told Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy was a Death Eater
[11069]1857   The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter,' drawled Mr
[11070]440    Malfoy
[11071]603    Quite astonishing, the way you continue to wriggle out of very tight holes
[11072]0   
[11073]0   
[11074]0   
[11075]85    Snakelike, in fact

[11077]0   
[11078]372   'Mr
[11079]11268    Weasley gripped Harry's shoulder in warning
[11080]12161   Yeah,' said Harry, yeah, I'm good at escaping
[11081]1468   'Lucius Malfoy raised his eyes to Mr
[11082]5907    Weasley's face
[11083]702   And Arthur Weasley too
[11084]248   What are you doing here, Arthur
[11085]5561  'I work here,' said Mr
[11086]648    Weasley curtly
[11087]30   Not here, surely
[11088]5458  ' said Mr
[11089]1413    Malfoy, raising his eyebrows and glancing towards the door over Mr
[11090]5500    Weasley's shoulder

[11092]0   
[11093]0   
[11094]0

[11096]372  'No,' Mr
[11097]11357    Weasley snapped, his fingers now biting into Harry's shoulder
[11098]183   What areyou doing here, anyway
[11099]6582  ' Harry asked Lucius Malfoy
[11100]9751   I don't think private matters between myself and the Minister are any concern of yours, Potter,' said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his robes
[11101]6926    Harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold
[11102]6977    Really, just because you are Dumbledore's favourite boy, you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us
[11103]0   
[11104]0   
[11105]0   
[11106]234    Shall we go up to your office, then, Minister
[11107]11510  'Certainly,' said Fudge, turning his back on Harry and Mr
[11108]636    Weasley
[11109]409    This way, Lucius
[11110]322   'They strode off together, talking in low voices
[11111]372    Mr
[11112]12295    Weasley did not let go of Harry's shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift
[11113]9199   Why wasn't he waiting outside Fudge's office if they've got business to do together
[11114]5853  ' Harry burst out furiously
[11115]182    What was he doing down here
[11116]5822  'Trying to sneak down to the courtroom, if you ask me,' said Mr
[11117]1764    Weasley, looking extremely agitated and glancing over his shoulder as though making sure they could not be overheard
[11118]897    Trying to find out whether you'd been expelled or not
[11119]7947    I'll leave a note for Dumbledore when I drop you off, he ought to know Malfoy's been talking to Fudge again
[11120]746   'What private business have they got together, anyway
[11121]5575  'Gold, I expect,' said Mr
[11122]719    Weasley angrily

[11140]491   'The lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around Mr
[11141]6130    Weasley's head as he pressed the button for the Atrium and the doors clanged shut
[11142]394    He waved them away irritably
[11143]372   Mr
[11144]21326    Weasley,' said Harry slowly, if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like Malfoy, if he's seeing them alone, how do we know they haven't put the Imperius Curse on him
[11145]17120  'Don't think it hadn't occurred to us, Harry,' said Mr
[11146]773    Weasley quietly
[11147]2349    But Dumbledore thinks Fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment-which, as Dumbledore says, is not a lot of comfort

[11163]1107    Weasley, and, pulling his moneybag from his pocket, he turned back to the fountain
[11164]13024   He looked up into the handsome wizard's face, but up close, Harry thought he looked rather weak and foolish
[11165]7353    The witch was wearing a vapid smile like a beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of goblins and centaurs, they were most unlikely to be caught staring so soppily at humans of any description
[11166]5760    Only the house-elf's attitude of creeping servility looked convincing
[11167]9619    With a grin at the thought of what Hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf, Harry turned his moneybag upside-down and emptied not just ten Galleons, but the whole contents into the pool at the statues' feet

[11172]11999   'Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering you all knew I'd get off,' said Harry, smiling

[11174]9623    Weasley was wiping her face on her apron, and Fred, George, and Ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went: He got off, he got off, he got off-'That's enough
[11175]7   Settle down
[11176]507  ' shouted Mr
[11177]702    Weasley, though he too was smiling
[11178]1436    Listen, Sirius, Lucius Malfoy was at the Ministry-'What
[11179]5788  ' said Sirius sharply
[11180]2111   He got off, he got off, he got off-'Be quiet, you three
[11181]6308   Yes, we saw him talking to Fudge on Level Nine, then they went up to Fudge's office together
[11182]1650    Dumbledore ought to know
[11183]5754   'Absolutely,' said Sirius
[11184]3885    We'll tell him, don't worry
[11185]6245   'Well, I'd better get going, there's a vomiting toilet waiting for me in Bethnal Green
[11186]9307    Molly, I'll be late, I'm covering for Tonks, but Kingsley might be dropping in for dinner-'He got off, he got off, he got off-'That's enough-Fred-George-Ginny
[11187]5455  ' said Mrs
[11188]1008    Weasley, as Mr
[11189]995    Weasley left the kitchen
[11190]6428    Harry, dear, come and sit down, have some lunch, you hardly ate breakfast
[11191]0   
[11192]0   
[11193]0   
[11194]15903   'Ron and Hermione sat themselves down opposite him, looking happier than they had done since he had first arrived at Grimmauld Place, and Harry's feeling of giddy relief, which had been somewhat dented by his encounter with Lucius Malfoy, swelled again
[11195]1391    The gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden; even Kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the noise
[11196]14375   ' Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no way they were going to convict you,' said Ron happily, now dishing great mounds of mashed potato on to everyone's plates
[11197]11134   Yeah, he swung it for me,' said Harry
[11198]1413    He felt it would sound highly ungrateful, not to mention childish, to say, I wish he'd talked to me, though
[11199]676    Or even looked at me
[11200]950   'And as he thought this, the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he clapped his hand to it
[11201]0   
[11202]4750   What's up
[11203]7324  ' said Hermione, looking alarmed
[11204]5845   Scar,' Harry mumbled
[11205]4750    But it's nothing

[11209]565    It happens all the time now

[11212]0   
[11213]12018   'None of the others had noticed a thing; all of them were now helping themselves to food while gloating over Harry's narrow escape; Fred, George, and Ginny were still singing
[11214]11448    Hermione looked rather anxious, but before she could say anything, Ron had said happily, I bet Dumbledore turns up this evening, to celebrate with us, you know
[11215]11653   'I don't think he'll be able to, Ron,' said Mrs
[11216]6466    Weasley, setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of Harry
[11217]5339    He's really very busy at the moment
[11218]1380   'HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF
[11219]795    HE GOT OFF-'SHUT UP
[11220]416  ' roared Mrs
[11221]636    Weasley
[11222]7254   Over the next few days Harry could not help noticing that there was one person within number twelve, Grimmauld Place, who did not seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to Hogwarts
[11223]13655    Sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news, wringing Harry's hand and beaming just like the rest of them
[11224]11964    Soon, however, he was moodier and surlier than before, talking less to everybody, even Harry, and spending increasing amounts of time shut up in his mother's room with Buckbeak
[11225]3131   Don't you go feeling guilty
[11226]14977  ' said Hermione sternly, after Harry had confided some of his feelings to her and Ron while they scrubbed out a mouldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later
[11227]966    You belong at Hogwarts and Sirius knows it
[11228]5326    Personally, I think he's being selfish
[11229]17216   'That's a bit harsh, Hermione,' said Ron, frowning as he attempted to prise off a bit of mould that had attached itself firmly to his finger, you wouldn't want to be stuck inside this house without any company
[11230]588   'He'll have company
[11231]6701  ' said Hermione
[11232]7405    It's Headquarters to the Order of the Phoenix, isn't it
[11233]7375   He just got his hopes up that Harry would be coming to live here with him
[11234]19132   'I don't think that's true,' said Harry, wringing out his cloth
[11235]2944    He wouldn't give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could
[11236]10561   'He just didn't want to get his own hopes up even more,' said Hermione wisely
[11237]2101    And he probably felt a bit guilty himself, because I think a part of him was really hoping you'd be expelled
[11238]622    Then you'd both be outcasts together
[11239]436   'Come off it
[11240]14498  ' said Harry and Ron together, but Hermione merely shrugged
[11241]15   Suit yourselves
[11242]19219    But I sometimes think Ron's mum's right and Sirius gets confused about whether you're you or your father, Harry
[11243]5822   'So you think he's touched in the head
[11244]10824  ' said Harry heatedly
[11245]13777   No, I just think he's been very lonely for a long time,' said Hermione simply
[11246]454   At this point, Mrs
[11247]758    Weasley entered the bedroom behind them
[11248]70   Still not finished
[11249]5622  ' she said, poking her head into the cupboard
[11250]758   I thought you might be here to tell us to have a break
[11251]7105  ' said Ron bitterly
[11252]2875    D'you know how much mould we've got rid of since we arrived here
[11253]5773  'You were so keen to help the Order,' said Mrs
[11254]1018    Weasley, you can do your bit by making Headquarters fit to live in
[11255]3174   'I feel like a house-elf,' grumbled Ron
[11256]5661   Well, now you understand what dreadful lives they lead, perhaps you'll be a bit more active in S

[11258]17   E
[11259]18   W
[11260]0   
[11261]7094  ' said Hermione hopefully, as Mrs
[11262]911    Weasley left them to it
[11263]10007    You know, maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the time-we could do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room, all proceeds to S
[11264]21   P
[11265]17   E
[11266]18   W
[11267]8747   , it would raise awareness as well as funds-'I'll sponsor you to shut up about spew,' Ron muttered irritably, but only so Harry could hear him
[11268]15611   Harry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached; he could not wait to see Hagrid again, to play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the Herbology greenhouses; it would be a treat just to leave this dusty, musty house, where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and Kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed, though Harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of Sirius
[11269]6951   The fact was that living at the Headquarters of the anti-Voldemort movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as Harry would have expected before he'd experienced it
[11270]1337    Though members of the Order of the Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for meals, sometimes only for a few minutes of whispered conversation, Mrs
[11271]14550    Weasley made sure that Harry and the others were kept well out of earshot (whether Extendable or normal) and nobody, not even Sirius, seemed to feel that Harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival
[11272]13158   On the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hedwig's owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when Ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes
[11273]11194   Booklists have arrived,' he said, throwing one of the envelopes up to Harry, who was standing on a chair
[11274]2095    About time, I thought they'd forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this
[11275]0   
[11276]0   
[11277]0   
[11278]13542   'Harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over Ron's head into the wastepaper basket in the corner, which swallowed it and belched loudly
[11279]258    He then opened his letter
[11280]1041    It contained two pieces of parchment: one the usual reminder that term started on the first of September; the other telling him which books he would need for the coming year
[11281]5656   Only two new ones,' he said, reading the list, The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5, by Miranda Goshawk, and Defensive Magical Theory, by Wilbert Slinkhard
[11282]35   'Crack
[11283]7098   Fred and George Apparated right beside Harry
[11284]3095    He was so used to them doing this by now that he didn't even fall off his chair
[11285]6446   We were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard book,' said Fred conversationally
[11286]11729   Because it means Dumbledore's found a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,' said George
[11287]6070   And about time too,' said Fred
[11288]852   What d'you mean
[11289]6105  ' Harry asked, jumping down beside them
[11290]8368   Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few weeks back,' Fred told Harry, and from what they were saying, Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year
[11291]5354   'Not surprising, is it, when you look at what's happened to the last four
[11292]5464  ' said George
[11293]15949   One sacked, one dead, one's memory removed, and one locked in a trunk for nine months,' said Harry, counting them off on his fingers
[11294]508    Yeah, I see what you mean
[11295]6752   'What's up with you, Ron
[11296]784  ' asked Fred
[11297]2742   Ron did not answer
[11298]6533    Harry looked round
[11299]3079    Ron was standing very still with his mouth slightly open, gaping at his letter from Hogwarts
[11300]4836   What's the matter
[11301]8347  ' said Fred impatiently, moving around Ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment
[11302]5749   Fred's mouth fell open, too
[11303]63   Prefect
[11304]5365  ' he said, staring incredulously at the letter
[11305]63    Prefect
[11306]8039  'George leapt forward, seized the envelope in Ron's other hand and turned it upside-down
[11307]11306    Harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into George's palm
[11308]6372   No way,' said George in a hushed voice
[11309]17393   There's been a mistake,' said Fred, snatching the letter out of Ron's grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark
[11310]2977    No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect
[11311]6279   'The twins' heads turned in unison and both of them stared at Harry
[11312]389   We thought you were a cert
[11313]11646  ' said Fred, in a tone that suggested Harry had tricked them in some way
[11314]1260   We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you
[11315]5481  ' said George indignantly
[11316]18   Winning the Triwizard and everything
[11317]5514  ' said Fred
[11318]6807   I suppose all the mad stuff must've counted against him,' said George to Fred
[11319]5917   Yeah,' said Fred slowly
[11320]1087    Yeah, you've caused too much trouble, mate
[11321]5998    Well, at least one of you's got their priorities right
[11322]8331   'He strode over to Harry and clapped him on the back while giving Ron a scathing look

[11329]8185   'Oh, Mum's going to be revolting,' groaned George, thrusting the prefect badge back at Ron as though it might contaminate him
[11330]13628   Ron, who still had not said a word, took the badge, stared at it for a moment, then held it out to Harry as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was genuine
[11331]5944    Harry took it
[11332]434    A large P' was superimposed on the Gryffindor lion
[11333]7092    He had seen a badge just like this on Percy's chest on his very first day at Hogwarts
[11334]749   The door banged open
[11335]2552    Hermione came tearing into the room, her cheeks flushed and her hair flying
[11336]381    There was an envelope in her hand
[11337]1334   Did you-did you get-
[11338]11229  'She spotted the badge in Harry's hand and let out a shriek
[11339]278   I knew it

[11341]5732    Me too, Harry, me too
[11342]18132  'No,' said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Ron's hand
[11343]6752    It's Ron, not me
[11344]0   'It-what
[11345]17633  'Ron's prefect, not me,' Harry said

[11380]737    If you give them to me I'll take them over to Diagon Alley this afternoon and get your books while you're packing
[11381]5203    Ron, I'll have to get you more pyjamas, these are at least six inches too short, I can't believe how fast you're growing

[11503]0   
[11504]0   
[11505]7880   'He dashed from the room, leaving Harry and Hermione alone
[11506]8849   For some reason, Harry found he did not want to look at Hermione
[11507]1109    He turned to his bed, picked up the pile of clean robes Mrs
[11508]1204    Weasley had laid on it and crossed the room to his trunk
[11509]5732   Harry
[11510]6713  ' said Hermione tentatively
[11511]15116   Well done, Hermione,' said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all, and, still not looking at her, brilliant
[11512]63    Prefect
[11513]257    Great
[11514]6741   'Thanks,' said Hermione
[11515]6356    Erm-Harry-could I borrow Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad
[11516]1296   They'll be really pleased-I mean prefect is something they can understand
[11517]12407   'Yeah, no problem,' said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him
[11518]0    Take her
[11519]2154  'He leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on the bottom of it and pretended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called Hedwig down
[11520]7580    A few moments passed; Harry heard the door close but remained bent double, listening; the only sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings
[11521]696   He straightened up and looked behind him
[11522]2103    Hermione had left and Hedwig had gone
[11523]7398    Harry hurried across the room, closed the door, then returned slowly to his bed and sank on to it, gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe
[11524]340   He had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year
[11525]1274    He had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way towards certain people
[11526]41    But if he had remembered 
[11527]0   
[11528]0   
[11529]388    if he had thought about it 
[11530]0   
[11531]0   
[11532]40    what would he have expected
[11533]6463  Not this, said a small and truthful voice inside his head
[11534]6458   Harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands
[11535]2993    He could not lie to himself; if he had known the prefect badge was on its way, he would have expected it to come to him, not Ron
[11536]1379    Did this make him as arrogant as Draco Malfoy
[11537]1233   Did he think himself superior to everyone else
[11538]3241   Did he really believe he was better than Ron
[11539]5777  No, said the small voice defiantly
[11540]52   Was that true
[11541]5829   Harry wondered, anxiously probing his own feelings
[11542]6395   I'm better at Quidditch, said the voice
[11543]624    But I'm not better at anything else
[11544]8445   That was definitely true, Harry thought; he was no better than Ron in lessons
[11545]188    But what about outside lessons
[11546]3968   What about those adventures he, Ron, and Hermione had had together since starting at Hogwarts, often risking much worse than expulsion
[11547]20770  Well, Ron and Hermione were with me most of the time, said the voice in Harry's head
[11548]6291   Not all the time, though, Harry argued with himself
[11549]2744    They didn't fight Quirrell with me
[11550]2866    They didn't take on Riddle and the Basilisk
[11551]3685    They didn't get rid of all those dementors the night Sirius escaped
[11552]2846    They weren't in that graveyard with me, the night Voldemort returned
[11553]0   
[11554]0   
[11555]0   
[11556]488   And the same feeling of ill-usage that had overwhelmed him on the night he had arrived rose again
[11557]6858    I've definitely done more, Harry thought indignantly
[11558]693    I've done more than either of them
[11559]10640  But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe Dumbledore doesn't choose prefects because they've got themselves into a load of dangerous situations
[11560]0   
[11561]0   
[11562]0   
[11563]78    Maybe he chooses them for other reasons
[11564]0   
[11565]0   
[11566]0   
[11567]4943    Ron must have something you don't
[11568]0   
[11569]0   
[11570]0   
[11571]17105   Harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the wardrobe's clawed feet, remembering what Fred had said
[11572]2977   No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect
[11573]0   
[11574]0   
[11575]0   
[11576]6174   'Harry gave a small snort of laughter
[11577]568    A second later he felt sickened with himself
[11578]3271   Ron had not asked Dumbledore to give him the prefect badge
[11579]6779    This was not Ron's fault
[11580]31056    Was he, Harry, Ron's best friend in the world, going to sulk because he didn't have a badge, laugh with the twins behind Ron's back, ruin this for Ron when, for the first time, he had beaten Harry at something
[11581]12961  At this point Harry heard Ron's footsteps on the stairs again
[11582]3296    He stood up, straightened his glasses, and hitched a grin on to his face as Ron bounded back through the door
[11583]906   Just caught her
[11584]5126  ' he said happily
[11585]661    She says she'll get the Cleansweep if she can
[11586]11771   'Cool,' Harry said, and he was relieved to hear that his voice had stopped sounding hearty
[11587]2098    Listen-Ron-well done, mate
[11588]7385   'The smile faded off Ron's face
[11589]388   I never thought it would be me
[11590]5672  ' he said, shaking his head
[11591]388    I thought it would be you
[11592]12068  'Nah, I've caused too much trouble,' Harry said, echoing Fred
[11593]7705   Yeah,' said Ron, yeah, I suppose
[11594]0   
[11595]0   
[11596]0   
[11597]3259    Well, we'd better get our trunks packed, hadn't we
[11598]152  'It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived
[11599]998    It took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks
[11600]8178    Marry noticed that Ron kept moving his prefect's badge around, first placing it on his bedside table, then putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and lying it on his folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the black
[11601]1789    Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk
[11602]369   Mrs
[11603]3720    Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six o'clock, laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that Ron took from her with a moan of longing
[11604]9245   Never mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving for dinner, I want you all downstairs,' she said, but the moment she was out of sight Ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom, an ecstatic expression on his face
[11605]374   Down in the basement Mrs
[11606]4936    Weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table, which read CONGRATULATIONS RON AND HERMIONE-NEW PREFECTS
[11607]6817    She looked in a better mood than Harry had seen her all holiday
[11608]12756   I thought we'd have a little party not a sit-down dinner,' she told Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny as they entered the room
[11609]2452    Your father and Bill are on their way, Ron
[11610]973    I've sent them both owls and they're thrilled,' she added, beaming
[11611]938   Fred rolled his eyes
[11612]7798   Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, and Kingsley Shacklebolt were already there and Mad-Eye Moody stumped in shortly after Harry had got himself a Butterbeer
[11613]5850   Oh, Alastor, I am glad you're here,' said Mrs
[11614]1030    Weasley brightly, as Mad-Eye shrugged off his travelling cloak
[11615]7237    We've been wanting to ask you for ages-could you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us what's inside it
[11616]8796   We haven't wanted to open it just in case it's something really nasty
[11617]72   'No problem, Molly
[11618]0   
[11619]0   
[11620]5376   'Moody's electric-blue eye swivelled upwards and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchen

[11635]1080  'No, no, I'll do it myself later,' beamed Mrs
[11636]664    Weasley, you have your drink
[11637]642    We're having a little bit of a celebration, actually
[11638]0

[11642]162    Fourth prefect in the family
[11643]12012  ' she said fondly, ruffling Ron's hair
[11644]91   Prefect, eh
[11645]3088  ' growled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and his magical eye swivelling around to gaze into the side of his head
[11646]7749    Harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away towards Sirius and Lupin
[11647]10884   Well, congratulations,' said Moody, still glaring at Ron with his normal eye, authority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose Dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he wouldn't have appointed you
[11648]0   
[11649]0   
[11650]0   
[11651]3045   'Ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother
[11652]369    Mrs
[11653]7232    Weasley was in such a good mood she did not even complain that they had brought Mundungus with them; he was wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the offer to remove it and put it with Moody's travelling cloak
[11654]6188   Well, I think a toast is in order,' said Mr
[11655]664    Weasley, when everyone had a drink
[11656]131    He raised his goblet
[11657]3967    To Ron and Hermione, the new Gryffindor prefects
[11658]3644  'Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to them, and then applauded
[11659]11530   I was never a prefect myself,' said Tonks brightly from behind Harry as everybody moved towards the table to help themselves to food
[11660]6864    Her hair was tomato red and waist-length today; she looked like Ginny's older sister
[11661]5831    My Head of House said I lacked certain necessary qualities
[11662]734   'Like what
[11663]5435  ' said Ginny, who was choosing a baked potato
[11664]5934   Like the ability to behave myself,' said Tonks
[11665]4623   Ginny laughed; Hermione looked as though she did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of Butterbeer and choking on it
[11666]647   What about you, Sirius
[11667]2318  ' Ginny asked, thumping Hermione on the back
[11668]8143   Sirius, who was right beside Harry, let out his usual bark-like laugh
[11669]783   No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in detention with James
[11670]1362    Lupin was the good boy, he got the badge
[11671]6961   'I think Dumbledore might have hoped I would be able to exercise some control over my best friends,' said Lupin
[11672]469    I need scarcely say that I failed dismally
[11673]10644   'Harry's mood suddenly lifted
[11674]158    His father had not been a prefect either
[11675]678    All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; he loaded up his plate, feeling doubly fond of everyone in the room
[11676]2297   Ron was rhapsodising about his new broom to anybody who would listen

[11682]2077  'Hermione was talking very earnestly to Lupin about her view of elf rights
[11683]7500   I mean, it's the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation, isn't it
[11684]488   It all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking they're superior to other creatures

[11694]13182  'Oh-I dunno-' said Harry, slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion; he slid away from them in the direction of Fred and George, who were huddled in a corner with Mundungus
[11695]12598   Mundungus stopped talking when he saw Harry, but Fred winked and beckoned Harry closer
[11696]15713   It's OK,' he told Mundungus, we can trust Harry, he's our financial backer
[11697]17556   'Look what Dung's got us,' said George, holding out his hand to Harry
[11698]1652    It was full of what looked like shrivelled black pods
[11699]276    A faint rattling noise was coming from them, even though they were completely stationary
[11700]5470   Venomous Tentacula seeds,' said George
[11701]1625    We need them for the Skiving Snackboxes but they're a Class C Non-Tradeable Substance so we've been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them

[11706]1110    I'm sorry, lads, but I'm not taking a Knut under twenty
[11707]11591   'Dung likes his little joke,' Fred said to Harry
[11708]6076   Yeah, his best one so far has been six Sickles for a bag of Knarl quills,' said George

[11715]448   Good point, that,' he grunted
[11716]1214    All right, lads, ten it is, if you'll take em quick
[11717]5744   'Cheers, Harry
[11718]5849  ' said Fred delightedly, when Mundungus had emptied his pockets into the twins' outstretched hands and scuttled off towards the food

[11724]1199    It had just occurred to him that Mr
[11725]369    and Mrs
[11726]2713    Weasley would want to know how Fred and George were financing their joke shop business when, as was inevitable, they finally found out about it
[11727]1896    Giving the twins his Triwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but what if it led to another family row and a Percy-like estrangement
[11728]369   Would Mrs
[11729]8377    Weasley still feel that Harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for Fred and George to start a career she thought quite unsuitable
[11730]6519  Standing where the twins had left him, with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company, Harry caught the sound of his own name
[11731]5460    Kingsley Shacklebolt's deep voice was audible even over the surrounding chatter

[11746]650   Mad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained of his nose; evidently he could not detect any trace of poison, because he then tore a strip off it with his teeth

[11831]10910  'Harry's heart turned over
[11832]6782    His mother and father were beaming up at him, sitting on either side of a small, watery-eyed man whom Harry recognised at once as Wormtail, the one who had betrayed his parents' whereabouts to Voldemort and so helped to bring about their deaths
[11833]28   Eh
[11834]5186  ' said Moody
[11835]11829   Harry looked up into Moody s heavily scarred and pitted face
[11836]6964    Evidently Moody was under the impression he had just given Harry a bit of a treat
[11837]11138   Yeah,' said Harry, once again attempting to grin

[11845]12915    Sirius had just said, What's that you've got there, Mad-Eye
[11846]432  ' and Moody had turned towards him
[11847]6461    Harry crossed the kitchen, slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call him back
[11848]1822   He did not know why it had been such a shock; he had seen pictures of his parents before, after all, and he had met Wormtail 
[11849]0   
[11850]0   
[11851]762    but to have them sprung on him like that, when he was least expecting it

[11874]6715   Harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed elf-heads, glad to be on his own again, but as he approached the first landing he heard noises
[11875]489    Someone was sobbing in the drawing room
[11876]36   Hello
[11877]10818  ' Harry said
[11878]173   There was no answer but the sobbing continued
[11879]2008    He climbed the remaining stairs two at a time, walked across the landing and opened the drawing-room door
[11880]1394   Someone was cowering against the dark wall, her wand in her hand, her whole body shaking with sobs
[11881]2440    Sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch of moonlight, clearly dead, was Ron
[11882]21451   All the air seemed to vanish from Harry's lungs; he felt as though he were falling through the floor; his brain turned icy cold-Ron dead, no, it couldn't be-'But wait a moment, it couldn't be- Ron was downstairs-Mrs

[11918]6831    Weasley to the dead Harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant
[11919]5691    Pulling out his own wand, he said, very firmly and clearly, Riddikulus
[11920]10612  'Harry's body vanished
[11921]252    A silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain

[11976]1268    Weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name

[11978]5536    You weren't in the Order then, you don't understand

[11985]8866   Don't worry about Percy,' said Sirius abruptly
[11986]1128    He'll come round
[11987]11430    It's only a matter of time before Voldemort moves into the open; once he does, the whole Ministry's going to be begging us to forgive them
[11988]1354    And I'm not sure I'll be accepting their apology,' he added bitterly
[11989]15142   And as for who's going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and Arthur died,' said Lupin, smiling slightly, what do you think we'd do, let them starve
[11990]369  'Mrs
[11991]673    Weasley smiled tremulously

[11993]7467   But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later, could not think Mrs
[11994]654    Weasley silly
[11995]1204    He could still see his parents beaming up at him from the battered old photograph, unaware that their lives, like so many of those around them, were drawing to a close
[11996]408    The image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of Mrs
[11997]6133    Weasley's family in turn kept flashing before his eyes
[11998]323   Without warning, the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his stomach churned horribly
[11999]5351   Cut it out,' he said firmly, rubbing the scar as the pain receded
[12000]6513   First sign of madness, talking to your own head,' said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall
[12001]5755   Harry ignored it
[12002]6524    He felt older than he had ever felt in his life and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had got a prefect's badge

[12020]506    His parents wove in and out of his dreams, never speaking; Mrs
[12021]15900    Weasley sobbed over Kreacher's dead body, watched by Ron and Hermione who were wearing crowns, and yet again Harry found himself walking down a corridor ending in a locked door

[12031]8210    From what he heard as he dressed at top speed, Harry gathered that Fred and George had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them, with the result that they had hurtled straight into Ginny and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall; Mrs
[12032]607    Black and Mrs
[12033]699    Weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices
[12034]9938   -COULD HAVE DONE HER A SERIOUS INJURY, YOU IDIOTS-'-FILTHY HALF-BREEDS, BESMIRCHING THE HOUSE OF MY FATHERS-'Hermione came hurrying into the room looking flustered, just as Harry was putting on his trainers
[12035]380    Hedwig was swaying on her shoulder, and she was carrying a squirming Crookshanks in her arms
[12036]1403   Mum and Dad just sent Hedwig back'-the owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of her cage-'are you ready yet

[12044]4835    We have to go to King's Cross with a guard

[12048]6321    I thought Voldemort was supposed to be lying low, or are you telling me he's going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do me in
[12049]20761   'I don't know, it's just what Mad-Eye says,' said Hermione distractedly, looking at her watch, but if we don't leave soon we're definitely going to miss the train

[12057]369   Mrs
[12058]5529    Black's portrait was howling with rage but nobody was bothering to close the curtains over her; all the noise in the hall was bound to rouse her again, anyway

[12107]17118   It took them twenty minutes to reach King's Cross on foot and nothing more eventful happened during that time than Sirius scaring a couple of cats for Harry's entertainment
[12108]1228    Once inside the station they lingered casually beside the barrier between platforms nine and ten until the coast was clear, then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through on to platform nine and three-quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families

[12168]0  'See you

[12174]10095   Oh, lighten up,' said Ron, he hasn't seen daylight for months, poor bloke
[12175]9700   'Well,' said Fred, clapping his hands together, can't stand around chatting all day, we've got business to discuss with Lee
[12176]1222    See you later,' and he and George disappeared down the corridor to the right
[12177]719   The train was gathering still more speed, so that the houses outside the window flashed past, and they swayed where they stood
[12178]13   Shall we go and find a compartment, then
[12179]6088  ' Harry asked
[12180]3731   Ron and Hermione exchanged looks
[12181]7209   Er,' said Ron
[12182]8878   We're-well-Ron and I are supposed to go into the prefect carriage,' Hermione said awkwardly
[12183]11454   Ron wasn't looking at Harry; he seemed to have become intensely interested in the fingernails on his left hand
[12184]11180   Oh,' said Harry
[12185]557    Right
[12186]75    Fine
[12187]11022   'I don't think we'll have to stay there all journey,' said Hermione quickly
[12188]7794    Our letters said we just get instructions from the Head Boy and Girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time
[12189]10893   'Fine,' said Harry again
[12190]125    Well, I-I might see you later, then
[12191]13633   'Yeah, definitely,' said Ron, casting a shifty, anxious look at Harry
[12192]6874    It's a pain having to go down there, I'd rather-but we have to-I mean, I'm not enjoying it, I'm not Percy,' he finished defiantly
[12193]11604   I know you're not,' said Harry and he grinned
[12194]10098    But as Hermione and Ron dragged their trunks, Crookshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon off towards the engine end of the train, Harry felt an odd sense of loss
[12195]2264    He had never travelled on the Hogwarts Express without Ron
[12196]1841   Come on,' Ginny told him, if we get a move on we'll be able to save them places
[12197]16707   'Right,' said Harry, picking up Hedwig's cage in one hand and the handle of his trunk in the other
[12198]474    They struggled off down the corridor, peering through the glass-panelled doors into the compartments they passed, which were already full
[12199]6768    Harry could not help noticing that a lot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of them nudged their neighbours and pointed him out
[12200]483    After he had met this behaviour in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the Daily Prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying show-off he was
[12201]607    He wondered dully whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories
[12202]12293   In the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom, Harry's fellow fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip on his struggling toad, Trevor
[12203]5773   Hi, Harry,' he panted
[12204]362    Hi, Ginny
[12205]0   
[12206]0   
[12207]0   
[12208]4750    Everywhere's full
[12209]0   
[12210]0

[12212]2369    I can't find a seat
[12213]0   
[12214]0   
[12215]0   
[12216]144   'What are you talking about
[12217]5919  ' said Ginny, who had squeezed past Neville to peer into the compartment behind him
[12218]10329    There's room in this one, there's only Loony Lovegood in here-'Neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone
[12219]13744   Don't be silly,' said Ginny, laughing, she's all right
[12220]1238   'She slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside
[12221]6159    Harry and Neville followed
[12222]5643   Hi, Luna,' said Ginny, is it okay if we take these seats
[12223]899  'The girl beside the window looked up
[12224]1536    She had straggly, waist-length, dirty-blonde hair, very pale eyebrows and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look
[12225]6368    Harry knew at once why Neville had chosen to pass this compartment by
[12226]297    The girl gave off an aura of distinct dottiness
[12227]1013    Perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping, or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of Butterbeer corks, or that she was reading a magazine upside-down
[12228]6851    Her eyes ranged over Neville and came to rest on Harry
[12229]58    She nodded
[12230]5528   Thanks,' said Ginny, smiling at her
[12231]11085   Harry and Neville stowed the three trunks and Hedwig's cage in the luggage rack and sat down
[12232]427    Luna watched them over her upside-down magazine, which was called The Quibbler
[12233]901    She did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans
[12234]8599    She stared and stared at Harry, who had taken the seat opposite her and now wished he hadn't
[12235]551   Had a good summer, Luna
[12236]692  ' Ginny asked
[12237]11865   Yes,' said Luna dreamily, without taking her eyes off Harry
[12238]1257    Yes, it was quite enjoyable, you know
[12239]6287    You're Harry Potter,' she added
[12240]11589   I know I am,' said Harry
[12241]312   Neville chuckled
[12242]1076    Luna turned her pale eyes on him instead
[12243]3712   And I don't know who you are
[12244]5841   'I'm nobody,' said Neville hurriedly
[12245]5477   No you're not,' said Ginny sharply
[12246]511    Neville Longbottom-Luna Lovegood
[12247]5105    Luna's in my year, but in Ravenclaw
[12248]10668   'Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure,' said Luna in a singsong voice
[12249]1021   She raised her upside-down magazine high enough to hide her face and fell silent
[12250]6881    Harry and Neville looked at each other with their eyebrows raised
[12251]344    Ginny suppressed a giggle
[12252]326   The train rattled onwards, speeding them out into open country
[12253]725    It was an odd, unsettled sort of day; one moment the carriage was full of sunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously grey clouds
[12254]711   Guess what I got for my birthday
[12255]5392  ' said Neville
[12256]1   Another Remembrall
[12257]16812  ' said Harry, remembering the marble-like device Neville's grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his abysmal memory
[12258]5392   No,' said Neville
[12259]345    I could do with one, though, I lost the old one ages ago

[12261]0   
[12262]0

[12267]2892   'He dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on Trevor into his schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what appeared to be a small grey cactus in a pot, except that it was covered with what looked like boils rather than spines
[12268]5111   Mimbulus mimbletonia,' he said proudly
[12269]6039   Harry stared at the thing
[12270]702    It was pulsating slightly, giving it the rather sinister look of some diseased internal organ
[12271]10765   It's really, really rare,' said Neville, beaming
[12272]8712    I don't know if there's one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even
[12273]3176    I can't wait to show it to Professor Sprout
[12274]1110    My Great Uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria
[12275]934    I'm going to see if I can breed from it
[12276]11875   'Harry knew that Neville's favourite subject was Herbology, but for the life of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted little plant
[12277]210   Does it-er-do anything
[12278]356  ' he asked
[12279]99   Loads of stuff
[12280]5403  ' said Neville proudly
[12281]5474    It's got an amazing defensive mechanism
[12282]57    Here, hold Trevor for me

[12285]0   
[12286]10803   'He dumped the toad into Harry's lap and took a quill from his schoolbag
[12287]6184    Luna Lovegood's popping eyes appeared over the top of her upside-down magazine again, watching what Neville was doing
[12288]1342    Neville held the Mimbulus mimbletonia up to his eyes, his tongue between his teeth, chose his spot, and gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quill
[12289]436   Liquid squirted from every boil on the plant; thick, stinking, dark green jets of it
[12290]19258    They hit the ceiling, the windows, and spattered Luna Lovegood's magazine; Ginny, who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in time, merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy green hat, but Harry, whose hands had been busy preventing Trevor's escape, received a faceful
[12291]742    It smelled like rancid manure
[12292]1911   Neville, whose face and torso were also drenched, shook his head to get the worst out of his eyes
[12293]41   Sosorry,' he gasped
[12294]2566    I haven't tried that before
[12295]0

[12300]0   
[12301]13908    Don't worry, though, Stinksap's not poisonous,' he added nervously, as Harry spat a mouthful on to the floor
[12302]1085   At that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open
[12303]362   Oh 
[12304]0   
[12305]0   
[12306]11424    hello, Harry,' said a nervous voice

[12308]0   
[12309]0   
[12310]648    bad time
[12311]6234  'Harry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his Trevor-free hand
[12312]1550    A very pretty girl with long, shiny black hair was standing in the doorway smiling at him: Cho Chang, the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team
[12313]362   Oh 
[12314]0   
[12315]0   
[12316]10866    hi,' said Harry blankly

[12327]11    bye then
[12328]1175   'Rather pink in the face, she closed the door and departed
[12329]5827    Harry slumped back in his seat and groaned
[12330]2534    He would have liked Cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their heads off at a joke he had just told; he would not have chosen to be sitting with Neville and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap
[12331]5581   Never mind,' said Ginny bracingly
[12332]507    Look, we can easily get rid of all this
[12333]581   ' She pulled out her wand
[12334]3    Scourgify
[12335]66  'The Stinksap vanished
[12336]95   Sorry
[12337]6079   ' said Neville again, in a small voice
[12338]5278   Ron and Hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour, by which time the food trolley had already gone by
[12339]7630    Harry, Ginny, and Neville had finished their pumpkin pasties and were busy swapping Chocolate Frog Cards when the compartment door slid open and they walked in, accompanied by Crookshanks and a shrilly hooting Pigwidgeon in his cage
[12340]13521   I'm starving,' said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig, grabbing a Chocolate Frog from Harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him
[12341]6449    He ripped open the wrapper, bit off the frog's head and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very exhausting morning
[12342]8054   Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each house,' said Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat
[12343]194    Boy and girl from each
[12344]4971   'And guess who's a Slytherin prefect
[12345]7670  ' said Ron, still with his eyes closed
[12346]6284   Malfoy,' replied Harry at once, certain his worst fear would be confirmed
[12347]7770   ' Course,' said Ron bitterly, stuffing the rest of the Frog into his mouth and taking another
[12348]6775   And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,' said Hermione viciously
[12349]5517    How she got to be a prefect when she's thicker than a concussed troll
[12350]0   
[12351]0   
[12352]4784   'Who are Hufflepuff's
[12353]6088  ' Harry asked
[12354]7209   Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott,' said Ron thickly
[12355]6767   And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw,' said Hermione
[12356]5881   You went to the Yule Ball with Padma Patil,' said a vague voice
[12357]3050   Everyone turned to look at Luna Lovegood, who was gazing unblinkingly at Ron over the top of The Quibbler
[12358]53    He swallowed his mouthful of Frog
[12359]7457   Yeah, I know I did,' he said, looking mildly surprised
[12360]2871   She didn't enjoy it very much,' Luna informed him
[12361]5418    She doesn't think you treated her very well, because you wouldn't dance with her
[12362]7927    I don't think I'd have minded,' she added thoughtfully, I don't like dancing very much
[12363]39   'She retreated behind The Quibbler again
[12364]4509    Ron stared at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds, then looked around at Ginny for some kind of explanation, but Ginny had stuffed her knuckles in her mouth to stop herself giggling
[12365]2660    Ron shook his head, bemused, then checked his watch
[12366]6823   We're supposed to patrol the corridors every so often,' he told Harry and Neville, and we can give out punishments if people are misbehaving
[12367]2541    I can't wait to get Crabbe and Goyle for something

[12369]0   
[12370]0   
[12371]2123   'You're not supposed to abuse your position, Ron

[12373]10814   Yeah, right, because Malfoy won't abuse it at all,' said Ron sarcastically
[12374]527   So you're going to descend to his level
[12375]2195  'No, I'm just going to make sure I get his mates before he gets mine
[12376]10730   'For heavens sake, Ron-'I'll make Goyle do lines, it'll kill him, he hates writing,' said Ron happily
[12377]6567    He lowered his voice to Goyle's low grunt and, screwing up his face in a look of pained concentration, mimed writing in midair

[12401]608    She let out a scream of mirth that caused Hedwig to wake up and flap her wings indignantly and Crookshanks to leap up into the luggage rack, hissing
[12402]843    Luna laughed so hard her magazine slipped out of her grasp, slid down her legs, and onto the floor
[12403]53   That was funny
[12404]2847  'Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring at Ron
[12405]8486    Utterly nonplussed, he looked around at the others, who were now laughing at the expression on Ron's face and at the ludicrously prolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was rocking backwards and forwards, clutching her sides
[12406]128   Are you taking the mickey

[12412]116  ' she choked, holding her ribs
[12413]6474   Everyone else was watching Luna laughing, but Harry, glancing at the magazine on the floor, noticed something that made him dive for it
[12414]12654    Upside-down it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front was, but Harry now realised it was a fairly bad cartoon of Cornelius Fudge; Harry only recognised him because of the lime-green bowler hat
[12415]719    One of Fudges hands was clenched around a bag of gold; the other hand was throttling a goblin
[12416]361    The cartoon was captioned: How Far Will Fudge Go to Gain Gringotts
[12417]274  Beneath this were listed the titles of other articles inside the magazine
[12418]566   CORRUPTION IN THE QUIDDITCH LEAGUE:How the Tornados are Taking ControlSECRETS OF THE ANCIENT RUINS REVEALEDSIRIUS BLACK: Villain or Victim
[12419]457  Can I have a look at this
[12420]6283  ' Harry asked Luna eagerly
[12421]2181   She nodded, still gazing at Ron, breathless with laughter
[12422]5933   Harry opened the magazine and scanned the index
[12423]841    Until this moment he had completely forgotten the magazine Kingsley had handed Mr
[12424]1316    Weasley to give to Sirius, but it must have been this edition of The Quibbler
[12425]413   He found the page, and turned excitedly to the article
[12426]9102   This, too, was illustrated by a rather bad cartoon; in fact, Harry would not have known it was supposed to be Sirius if it hadn't been captioned
[12427]1316    Sirius was standing on a pile of human bones with his wand out
[12428]10829    The headline on the article said:SIRIUS-Black As He's Painted Notorious Mass Murderer OR Innocent Singing Sensation
[12429]5971  Harry had to read this first sentence several times before he was convinced that he had not misunderstood it
[12430]689    Since when had Sirius been a singing sensation
[12431]1349  For fourteen years Sirius Black has been believed guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent Muggles and one wizard
[12432]5803    Black's audacious escape from Azkaban two years ago has led to the widest manhunt ever conducted by the Ministry of Magic
[12433]128    None of us has ever questioned that he deserves to be recaptured and handed back to the dementors
[12434]89   BUT DOES HE
[12435]1724  Startling new evidence has recently come to light that Sirius Black may not have committed the crimes for which he was sent to Azhaban
[12436]1090    In fact, says Doris Purkiss, of 18 Acanthia Way, Little Norton, Black may not even have been present at the killings
[12437]4624   What people don't realise is that Sirius Black is a false name,' says Mrs
[12438]2    Purkiss
[12439]2631    The man people believe to be Sirius Black is actually Stubby Boardman, lead singer of popular singing group The Hobgoblins, who retired from public life after being struck on the ear by a turnip at a concert in Little Norton Church Hall nearly fifteen years ago
[12440]705    I recognised him the moment I saw his picture in the paper
[12441]2918    Now, Stubby couldn't possibly have committed those crimes, because on the day in question he happened to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me
[12442]1170    I have written to the Minister for Magic and am expecting him to give Stubby, alias Sirius, a full pardon any day now
[12443]6032   'Harry finished reading and stared at the page in disbelief
[12444]449    Perhaps it was a joke, he thought, perhaps the magazine often printed spoof items
[12445]266    He flicked back a few pages and found the piece on Fudge
[12446]1178   Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic, denied that he had any plans to take over the running of the Wizarding Bank, Gringotts, when he was elected Minister for Magic jive years ago
[12447]307    Fudge has always insisted that he wants nothing more than to cooperate peacefully' with the guardians of our gold
[12448]89   BUT DOES HE
[12449]5598  Sources close to the Minister have recently disclosed that Fudge's dearest ambition is to seize control of the goblin gold supplies and that he will not hesitate to use force if need be
[12450]8286   It wouldn't be the first time, either,' said a Ministry insider
[12451]5068    Cornelius Goblin-Crusher Fudge, that's what his friends call him
[12452]34158    If you could hear him when he thinks no one's listening, oh, he's always talking about the goblins he's had done in; he's had them drowned, he's had them dropped off buildings, he's had them poisoned, he's had them cooked in pies
[12453]0   
[12454]0   
[12455]0   
[12456]6527   'Harry did not read any further
[12457]6179    Fudge might have many faults but Harry found it extremely hard to imagine him ordering goblins to be cooked in pies
[12458]142    He flicked through the rest of the magazine
[12459]1092    Pausing every few pages, he read: an accusation that the Tutshill Tornados were winning the Quidditch League by a combination of blackmail, illegal broom-tampering and torture; an interview with a wizard who claimed to have flown to the moon on a Cleansweep Six and brought back a bag of moon frogs to prove it; and an article on ancient runes which at least explained why Luna had been reading The Quibbler upside-down
[12460]5625    According to the magazine, if you turned the runes on their heads they revealed a spell to make your enemy's ears turn into kumquats
[12461]1392    In fact, compared to the rest of the articles in The Quibbler, the suggestion that Sirius might really be the lead singer of The Hobgoblins was quite sensible
[12462]343   Anything good in there
[12463]8214  ' asked Ron as Harry closed the magazine
[12464]12728   Of course not,' said Hermione scathingly, before Harry could answer
[12465]4872    The Quibbler's rubbish, everyone knows that
[12466]5965   'Excuse me,' said Luna; her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality

[12478]16634   'I'll have it back, thank you,' said Luna coldly, and leaning forwards she snatched it out of Harry's hands
[12479]2580    Riffling through it to page fifty-seven, she turned it resolutely upside-down again and disappeared behind it, just as the compartment door opened for the third time
[12480]8111   Harry looked around; he had expected this, but that did not make the sight of Draco Malfoy smirking at him from between his cronies Crabbe and Goyle any more enjoyable
[12481]0   What
[12482]5960  ' he said aggressively, before Malfoy could open his mouth
[12483]8185   Manners, Potter, or I'll have to give you a detention,' drawled Malfoy, whose sleek blond hair and pointed chin were just like his father's
[12484]537    You see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments
[12485]11236   'Yeah,' said Harry, but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone
[12486]4311   'Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville laughed
[12487]5236    Malfoy's lip curled
[12488]1896   Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter
[12489]356  ' he asked
[12490]7301   Shut up, Malfoy,' said Hermione sharply
[12491]5573   I seem to have touched a nerve,' said Malfoy, smirking
[12492]2110    Well, just watch yourself, Potter, because I'll be dogging your footsteps in case you step out of line
[12493]0   'Get out
[12494]6850  ' said Hermione, standing up
[12495]7063   Sniggering, Malfoy gave Harry a last malicious look and departed, with Crabbe and Goyle lumbering along in his wake
[12496]16028    Hermione slammed the compartment door behind them and turned to look at Harry, who knew at once that she, like him, had registered what Malfoy had said and been just as unnerved by it
[12497]7263   Chuck us another Frog,' said Ron, who had clearly noticed nothing
[12498]6307   Harry could not talk freely in front of Neville and Luna
[12499]2412    He exchanged another nervous look with Hermione, then stared out of the window
[12500]1564   He had thought Sirius coming with him to the station was a bit of a laugh, but suddenly it seemed reckless, if not downright dangerous
[12501]0   
[12502]0   
[12503]0   
[12504]2172    Hermione had been right
[12505]0   
[12506]0   
[12507]0   
[12508]1083    Sirius should not have come
[12509]372    What if Mr
[12510]1158    Malfoy had noticed the black dog and told Draco
[12511]1372   What if he had deduced that the Weasleys, Lupin, Tonks and Moody knew where Sirius was hiding
[12512]5379   Or had Malfoy's use of the word dogging' been a coincidence
[12513]75  The weather remained undecided as they travelled farther and farther north
[12514]718    Rain spattered the windows in a half-hearted way, then the sun put in a feeble appearance before clouds drifted over it once more
[12515]1778    When darkness fell and lamps came on inside the carriages, Luna rolled up The Quibbler, put it carefully away in her bag and took to staring at everyone in the compartment instead
[12516]7055   Harry was sitting with his forehead pressed against the train window, trying to get a first distant glimpse of Hogwarts, but it was a moonless night and the rain-streaked window was grimy
[12517]8293   We'd better change,' said Hermione at last, and all of them opened their trunks with difficulty and pulled on their school robes
[12518]2145    She and Ron pinned their prefect badges carefully to their chests
[12519]8487    Harry saw Ron checking his reflection in the black window
[12520]729   At last, the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket up and down it as everybody scrambled to get their luggage and pets assembled, ready for departure
[12521]10063    Ron and Hermione were supposed to supervise all this; they disappeared from the carriage again, leaving Harry and the others to look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon
[12522]13028   I'll carry that owl, if you like,' said Luna to Harry, reaching out for Pigwidgeon as Neville stowed Trevor carefully in an inside pocket
[12523]16318   Oh-er-thanks,' said Harry, handing her the cage and hoisting Hedwig's more securely into his arms
[12524]832   They shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the night air on their faces as they joined the crowd in the corridor
[12525]302    Slowly, they moved towards the doors
[12526]5910    Harry could smell the pine trees that lined the path down to the lake
[12527]1010    He stepped down on to the platform and looked around, listening for the familiar call of firs' years over ere 
[12528]0   
[12529]0   
[12530]174    firs' years
[12531]0   
[12532]0   
[12533]1103   'But it did not come
[12534]1090    Instead, a quite different voice, a brisk female one, was calling out, First years line up over here, please
[12535]167   All first years to me
[12536]13358  'A lantern came swinging towards Harry and by its light he saw the prominent chin and severe haircut of Professor Grubbly-Plank, the witch who had taken over Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures lessons for a while the previous year
[12537]5402   Where's Hagrid
[12538]5174  ' he said out loud
[12539]10797   I don't know,' said Ginny, but we'd better get out of the way, we're blocking the door
[12540]639   'Oh, yeah
[12541]0   
[12542]0   
[12543]6190   'Harry and Ginny became separated as they moved off along the platform and out through the station
[12544]14400    Jostled by the crowd, Harry squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of Hagrid; he had to be here, Harry had been relying on it-seeing Hagrid again was one of the things he'd been looking forward to most
[12545]67    But there was no sign of him
[12546]9172   He can't have left, Harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway on to the road outside with the rest of the crowd
[12547]6352    He's just got a cold or something
[12548]0   
[12549]0   
[12550]0   
[12551]7016   He looked around for Ron or Hermione, wanting to know what they thought about the reappearance of Professor Grubbly-Plank, but neither of them was anywhere near him, so he allowed himself to be shunted forward onto the dark rain-washed road outside Hogsmeade Station
[12552]809   Here stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches that always took the students above first year up to the castle
[12553]10946    Harry glanced quickly at them, turned away to keep a lookout for Ron and Hermione, then did a double-take
[12554]63   The coaches were no longer horseless
[12555]215    There were creatures standing between the carriage shafts
[12556]234    If he had had to give them a name, he supposed he would have called them horses, though there was something reptilian about them, too
[12557]341    They were completely fleshless, their black coats clinging to their skeletons, of which every bone was visible
[12558]809    Their heads were dragonish, and their pupil-less eyes white and staring
[12559]1133    Wings sprouted from each wither-vast, black leathery wings that looked as though they ought to belong to giant bats
[12560]949    Standing still and quiet in the gathering gloom, the creatures looked eerie and sinister
[12561]6356    Harry could not understand why the coaches were being pulled by these horrible horses when they were quite capable of moving along by themselves
[12562]4756   Where's Pig
[12563]18666  ' said Ron's voice, right behind Harry
[12564]13996   That Luna girl was carrying him,' said Harry, turning quickly, eager to consult Ron about Hagrid
[12565]1323    Where d'you reckon-'-Hagrid is
[12566]7219   I dunno,' said Ron, sounding worried
[12567]826    He'd better be okay
[12568]0   
[12569]0   
[12570]0   
[12571]2814   'A short distance away, Draco Malfoy, followed by a small gang of cronies including Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy Parkinson, was pushing some timid-looking second-years out of the way so that he and his friends could get a coach to themselves
[12572]1966    Seconds later, Hermione emerged panting from the crowd
[12573]662   Malfoy was being absolutely foul to a first-year back there
[12574]11014    I swear I'm going to report him, he's only had his badge three minutes and he's using it to bully people worse than ever

[12581]0   
[12582]0   
[12583]0   
[12584]1347   'Ginny had just emerged from the crowd, clutching a squirming Crookshanks
[12585]7116   Thanks,' said Hermione, relieving Ginny of the cat
[12586]5517    Come on, let's get a carriage together before they all fill up

[12589]0   
[12590]3134   'I haven't got Pig yet
[12591]8781  ' Ron said, but Hermione was already heading off towards the nearest unoccupied coach
[12592]7772    Harry remained behind with Ron
[12593]805   What are those things, d'you reckon
[12594]2761  ' he asked Ron, nodding at the horrible horses as the other students surged past them
[12595]134   What things
[12596]5524  'Those horse-'Luna appeared holding Pigwidgeon's cage in her arms; the tiny owl was twittering excitedly as usual
[12597]5086   Here you are,' she said
[12598]7565    He's a sweet little owl, isn't he
[12599]121  'Er 
[12600]0   
[12601]0   
[12602]277    yeah 
[12603]0   
[12604]0   
[12605]12406    he's all right,' said Ron gruffly
[12606]5506    Well, come on then, let's get in
[12607]0   
[12608]0   
[12609]0   
[12610]5836    What were you saying, Harry
[12611]264  'I was saying, what are those horse things
[12612]15051  ' Harry said, as he, Ron, and Luna made for the carriage in which Hermione and Ginny were already sitting
[12613]160   What horse things
[12614]244  'The horse things pulling the carriages
[12615]10863  ' said Harry impatiently
[12616]986    They were, after all, about three feet from the nearest one; it was watching them with empty white eyes
[12617]8427    Ron, however, gave Harry a perplexed look
[12618]144   What are you talking about
[12619]1042  'I'm talking about-look
[12620]13720  'Harry grabbed Ron's arm and wheeled him about so that he was face to face with the winged horse
[12621]8787    Ron stared straight at it for a second, then looked back at Harry
[12622]697   What am I supposed to be looking at
[12623]4  'At the-there, between the shafts
[12624]6   Harnessed to the coach
[12625]14027   It's right there in front-'But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred to Harry
[12626]2308   Can't 
[12627]0   
[12628]0   
[12629]2308    can't you see them
[12630]0  'See what
[12631]7142  'Can't you see what's pulling the carriages
[12632]2729  'Ron looked seriously alarmed now
[12633]6457   Are you feeling all right, Harry
[12634]0  'I 
[12635]0   
[12636]0   
[12637]277    yeah
[12638]0   
[12639]0   
[12640]6034   'Harry felt utterly bewildered
[12641]697    The horse was there in front of him, gleaming solidly in the dim light issuing from the station windows behind them, vapour rising from its nostrils in the chilly night air
[12642]4088    Yet, unless Ron was faking-and it was a very feeble joke if he was-Ron could not see it at all
[12643]0   Shall we get in, then
[12644]13489  ' said Ron uncertainly, looking at Harry as though worried about him
[12645]11095   Yeah,' said Harry
[12646]277    Yeah, go on
[12647]0   
[12648]0   
[12649]23797   'It's all right,' said a dreamy voice from beside Harry as Ron vanished into the coach's dark interior
[12650]576    You're not going mad or anything
[12651]0    I can see them, too
[12652]0   'Can you
[12653]11083  ' said Harry desperately, turning to Luna
[12654]626    He could see the bat-winged horses reflected in her wide silvery eyes
[12655]6864   Oh, yes,' said Luna, I've been able to see them ever since my first day here
[12656]875    They've always pulled the carriages
[12657]2986    Don't worry
[12658]809    You're just as sane as I am
[12659]2130   'Smiling faintly, she climbed into the musty interior of the carriage after Ron
[12660]5858    Not altogether reassured, Harry followed her

[12668]13287     Harry did not want to tell the others that he and Luna were having the same hallucination, if that was what it was, so he said nothing more about the horses as he sat down inside the carriage and slammed the door behind him
[12669]565    Nevertheless, he could not help watching the silhouettes of the horses moving beyond the window
[12670]809   Did everyone see that Grubbly-Plank woman
[12671]692  ' asked Ginny
[12672]4932    What's she doing back here
[12673]3235   Hagrid can't have left, can he
[12674]8833  'I'll be quite glad if he has,' said Luna, he isn't a very good teacher, is he
[12675]292  'Yes, he is
[12676]13239  ' said Harry, Ron and Ginny angrily
[12677]7375   Harry glared at Hermione
[12678]5318    She cleared her throat and quickly said, Erm 
[12679]0   
[12680]0   
[12681]292    yes 
[12682]0   
[12683]0   
[12684]5093    he's very good
[12685]10801   'Well, we in Ravenclaw think he's a bit of a joke,' said Luna, unfazed
[12686]3515   You've got a rubbish sense of humour then,' Ron snapped, as the wheels below them creaked into motion
[12687]7756   Luna did not seem perturbed by Ron's rudeness; on the contrary, she simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly interesting television programme
[12688]138   Rattling and swaying, the carriages moved in convoy up the road
[12689]12207    When they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars on either side of the gates to the school grounds, Harry leaned forwards to try and see whether there were any lights on in Hagrid's cabin by the Forbidden Forest, but the grounds were in complete darkness
[12690]1288    Hogwarts Castle, however, loomed ever closer: a towering mass of turrets, jet black against the dark sky, here and there a window blazing fiery bright above them
[12691]6841   The carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the oak front doors and Harry got out of the carriage first
[12692]6614    He turned again to look for lit windows down by the Forest, but there was definitely no sign of life within Hagrid's cabin
[12693]2482    Unwillingly, because he had half-hoped they would have vanished, he turned his eyes instead upon the strange, skeletal creatures standing quietly in the chill night air, their blank white eyes gleaming
[12694]8519   Harry had once before had the experience of seeing something that Ron could not, but that had been a reflection in a mirror, something much more insubstantial than a hundred very solid-looking beasts strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages
[12695]198    If Luna was to be believed, the beasts had always been there but invisible
[12696]7837    Why, then, could Harry suddenly see them, and why could Ron not
[12697]106  Are you coming or what
[12698]7088  ' said Ron beside him
[12699]362   Oh 
[12700]0   
[12701]0   
[12702]11702    yeah,' said Harry quickly and they joined the crowd hurrying up the stone steps into the castle
[12703]2246   The Entrance Hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with footsteps as the students crossed the flagged stone floor for the double doors to the right, leading to the Great Hall and the start-of-term feast
[12704]3162   The four long house tables in the Great Hall were filling up under the starless black ceiling, which was just like the sky they could glimpse through the high windows
[12705]6022    Candles floated in midair all along the tables, illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted about the Hall and the faces of the students talking eagerly, exchanging summer news, shouting greetings at friends from other houses, eyeing one another's new haircuts and robes
[12706]6663    Again, Harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as he passed; he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor cared
[12707]738   Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table
[12708]23806    The moment they reached Gryffindor's, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth-years and left to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville found seats together about halfway down the table between Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor house ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom gave Harry airy, overly-friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had stopped talking about him a split second before
[12709]1690    He had more important things to worry about, however: he was looking over the students' heads to the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall
[12710]4750   He's not there
[12711]9571   'Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real need; Hagrid's size made him instantly obvious in any lineup
[12712]9909   He can't have left,' said Ron, sounding slightly anxious
[12713]13443   Of course he hasn't,' said Harry firmly
[12714]8253   You don't think he's 
[12715]0   
[12716]0   
[12717]61    hurt, or anything, do you
[12718]6702  ' said Hermione uneasily
[12719]10818   No,' said Harry at once
[12720]0   But where is he, then
[12721]16377  'There was a pause, then Harry said very quietly, so that Neville, Parvati and Lavender could not hear, Maybe he's not back yet
[12722]2023    You know-from his mission-the thing he was doing over the summer for Dumbledore
[12723]277   'Yeah 
[12724]0   
[12725]0   
[12726]16109    yeah, that'll be it,' said Ron, sounding reassured, but Hermione bit her lip, looking up and down the staff table as though hoping for some conclusive explanation of Hagrid's absence
[12727]4750   Who's that
[12728]5548  ' she said sharply, pointing towards the middle of the staff table
[12729]11083   Harry's eyes followed hers
[12730]3152    They lit first upon Professor Dumbledore, sitting in his high-backed golden chair at the centre of the long staff table, wearing deep-purple robes scattered with silvery stars and a matching hat
[12731]6455    Dumbledore's head was inclined towards the woman sitting next to him, who was talking into his ear
[12732]13099    She looked, Harry thought, like somebody's maiden aunt: squat, with short, curly, mouse-brown hair in which she had placed a horrible pink Alice band that matched the fluffy pink cardigan she wore over her robes
[12733]2483    Then she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw, with a shock of recognition, a pallid, toadlike face and a pair of prominent, pouchy eyes
[12734]5382   It's that Umbridge woman
[12735]0  'Who
[12736]6701  ' said Hermione
[12737]273   She was at my hearing, she works for Fudge
[12738]7173  'Nice cardigan,' said Ron, smirking
[12739]210   She works for Fudge
[12740]1709  ' Hermione repeated, frowning
[12741]4970    What on earth's she doing here, then
[12742]44  'Dunno 
[12743]0   
[12744]0   
[12745]2363   'Hermione scanned the staff table, her eyes narrowed
[12746]137   No,' she muttered, no, surely not 
[12747]0   
[12748]0   
[12749]15862   'Harry did not understand what she was talking about but did not ask; his attention had been caught by Professor Grubbly-Plank who had just appeared behind the staff table; she worked her way along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been Hagrid's
[12750]1485    That meant the first-years must have crossed the lake and reached the castle, and sure enough, a few seconds later, the doors from the Entrance Hall opened
[12751]2957    A long line of scared-looking first-years entered, led by Professor McGonagall, who was carrying a stool on which sat an ancient wizards hat, heavily patched and darned with a wide rip near the frayed brim
[12752]936   The buzz of talk in the Great Hall faded away
[12753]1974    The first-years lined up in front of the staff table facing the rest of the students, and Professor McGonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them, then stood back
[12754]233   The first-years' faces glowed palely in the candlelight
[12755]1660    A small boy right in the middle of the row looked as though he was trembling
[12756]6529    Harry recalled, fleetingly, how terrified he had felt when he had stood there, waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which house he belonged
[12757]348   The whole school waited with bated breath
[12758]12367    Then the rip near the hat's brim opened wide like a mouth and the Sorting Hat burst into song:In times of old when I was newAnd Hogwarts barely startedThe founders of our noble schoolThought never to be parted:United by a common goal,They had the selfsame yearning,To make the world's best magic schoolAnd pass along their learning
[12759]41   Together we will build and teach
[12760]1701  'The four good friends decidedAnd never did they dream that theyMight some day be divided,For were there such friends anywhereAs Slytherin and Gryffindor
[12761]266  Unless it was the second pairOf Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw
[12762]207  So how could it have gone so wrong
[12763]12  How could such friendships fail
[12764]112  Why, I was there and so can tellThe whole sad, sorry tale
[12765]6652   Said Slytherin, We'll teach just thoseWhose ancestry is purest
[12766]5724   'Said Ravenclaw, We'll teach those whoseIntelligence is surest
[12767]12535    'Said Gryffindor, We'll teach all thoseWith brave deeds to their name, 'Said Hufflepuff, I'll teach the lot,And treat them just the same
[12768]3230    'These differences caused little strifeWhen first they came to light,For each of the four founders hadA house in which they mightTake only those they wanted, so,For instance, SlytherinTook only pure-blood wizardsOf great cunning, just like him,And only those of sharpest mindWere taught by RavenclawWhile the bravest and the boldestWent to daring Gryffindor
[12769]1079   Good Hufflepuff, she took the rest,And taught them all she knew,Thus the houses and their foundersRetained friendships firm and true
[12770]517   So Hogwarts worked in harmonyFor several happy years,But then discord crept among usFeeding on our faults and fears
[12771]1401   The houses that, like pillars four,Had once held up our school,Now turned upon each other and,Divided, sought to rule
[12772]1530   And for a while it seemed the schoolMust meet an early end,What with duelling and with fightingAnd the clash of friend on friendAnd at last there came c morningWhen old Slytherin departedAnd though the fighting then died outHe left us quite downhearted
[12773]78   And never since the founders fourWere whittled down to threeHave the houses been unitedAs they once were meant to be
[12774]7544   And now the Sorting Hat is hereAnd you all know the score:I sort you into housesBecause that is what I'm for,But this year I'll go further,Listen closely to my song:Though condemned I am to split youStill I worry that it's wrong,Though I must fulfil my dutyAnd must quarter every yearStill I wonder whether SortingMay not bring the end I fear
[12775]2724   Oh, know the perils, read the signs,The warning history shows,For our Hogwarts is in dangerFrom external, deadly foesAnd we must unite inside herOr we'll crumble from withinI have told you, I have warned you 
[12776]0   
[12777]0   
[12778]365   Let the Sorting now begin
[12779]11301    The Hat became motionless once more; applause broke out, though it was punctured, for the first time in Harry's memory, with muttering and whispers
[12780]6880    All across the Great Hall students were exchanging remarks with their neighbours, and Harry, clapping along with everyone else, knew exactly what they were talking about
[12781]2736   Branched out a bit this year, hasn't it
[12782]7255  ' said Ron, his eyebrows raised
[12783]11375   Too right it has,' said Harry
[12784]1202   The Sorting Hat usually confined itself to describing the different qualities looked for by each of the four Hogwarts houses and its own role in Sorting them
[12785]6310    Harry could not remember it ever trying to give the school advice before
[12786]4865   I wonder if it's ever given warnings before
[12787]6939  ' said Hermione, sounding slightly anxious
[12788]6319   Yes, indeed,' said Nearly Headless Nick knowledgeably, leaning across Neville towards her (Neville winced; it was very uncomfortable to have a ghost lean through you)
[12789]2614    The Hat feels itself honour-bound to give the school due warning whenever it feels-'But Professor McGonagall, who was waiting to read out the list of first-years' names, was giving the whispering students the sort of look that scorches
[12790]980    Nearly Headless Nick placed a see-through finger to his lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt end
[12791]2935    With a last frowning look that swept the lour house tables, Professor McGonagall lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment and called out the first name
[12792]9   Abercrombie, Euan
[12793]7981   'The terrified-looking boy Harry had noticed earlier stumbled forwards and put the Hat on his head; it was only prevented from falling right down to his shoulders by his very prominent ears
[12794]942    The Hat considered for a moment, then the rip near the brim opened again and shouted:Gryffindor
[12795]9061  'Harry clapped loudly with the rest of Gryffindor house as Euan Abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down, looking as though he would like very much to sink through the floor and never be looked at again
[12796]694   Slowly, the long line of first-years thinned
[12797]17801    In the pauses between the names and the Sorting Hat's decisions, Harry could hear Ron's stomach rumbling loudly
[12798]3511    Finally, Zeller, Rose' was Sorted into Hufflepuff, and Professor McGonagall picked up the Hat and stool and marched them away as Professor Dumbledore rose to his feet
[12799]6793   Whatever his recent bitter feelings had been towards his Headmaster, Harry was somehow soothed to see Dumbledore standing before them all
[12800]2440    Between the absence of Hagrid and the presence of those dragonish horses, he had felt that his return to Hogwarts, so long anticipated, was full of unexpected surprises, like jarring notes in a familiar song
[12801]324    But this, at least, was how it was supposed to be: their Headmaster rising to greet them all before the start-of-term feast
[12802]6827   To our newcomers,' said Dumbledore in a ringing voice, his arms stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips, welcome
[12803]390   To our old hands-welcome back
[12804]684   There is a time for speech-making, but this is not it
[12805]2    Tuck in
[12806]2548  'There was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as Dumbledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so as to keep it out of the way of his plate-for food had appeared out of nowhere, so that the five long tables were groaning under joints and pies and dishes of vegetables, bread and sauces and flagons of pumpkin juice
[12807]7865   Excellent,' said Ron, with a kind of groan of longing, and he seized the nearest plate of chops and began piling them on to his plate, watched wistfully by Nearly Headless Nick
[12808]139   What were you saying before the Sorting
[12809]1993  ' Hermione asked the ghost
[12810]180    About the Hat giving warnings
[12811]8351  'Oh, yes,' said Nick, who seemed glad of a reason to turn away from Ron, who was now eating roast potatoes with almost indecent enthusiasm
[12812]1257    Yes, I have heard the Hat give several warnings before, always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school
[12813]320    And always, of course, its advice is the same: stand together, be strong from within
[12814]36   'Ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat
[12815]7088  ' said Ron
[12816]6769   His mouth was so full Harry thought it was quite an achievement for him to make any noise at all
[12817]16   I beg your pardon
[12818]7650  ' said Nearly Headless Nick politely, while Hermione looked revolted
[12819]18002    Ron gave an enormous swallow and said, How can it know if the school's in danger if it's a Hat
[12820]5457  'I have no idea,' said Nearly Headless Nick
[12821]6115    Of course, it lives in Dumbledore's office, so I daresay it picks things up there
[12822]120   'And it wants all the houses to be friends
[12823]12377  ' said Harry, looking over at the Slytherin table, where Draco Malfoy was holding court
[12824]93    Fat chance
[12825]7506   'Well, now, you shouldn't take that attitude,' said Nick reprovingly
[12826]4768    Peaceful co-operation, that's the key
[12827]65    We ghosts, though we belong to separate houses, maintain links of friendship
[12828]440    In spite of the competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I would never dream of seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron
[12829]7119   'Only because you're terrified of him,' said Ron
[12830]973   Nearly Headless Nick looked highly affronted
[12831]31   Terrified
[12832]320   I hope I, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, have never been guilty of cowardice in my life
[12833]220   The noble blood that runs in my veins-'What blood
[12834]2358  ' asked Ron
[12835]3158    Surely you haven't still got-
[12836]4799  'It's a figure of speech
[12837]5966  ' said Nearly Headless Nick, now so annoyed his head was trembling ominously on his partially severed neck
[12838]1044    I assume I am still allowed to enjoy the use of whichever words I like, even if the pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me
[12839]613   But I am quite used to students poking fun at my death, I assure you
[12840]2874  'Nick, he wasn't really laughing at you
[12841]9226  ' said Hermione, throwing a furious look at Ron
[12842]8402   Unfortunately, Ron's mouth was packed to exploding point again and all he could manage was Node iddum eentup sechew,' which Nick did not seem to think constituted an adequate apology
[12843]1420    Rising into the air, he straightened his feathered hat and swept away from them to the other end of the table, coming to rest between the Creevey brothers, Colin and Dennis
[12844]3668   Well done, Ron,' snapped Hermione
[12845]0   What
[12846]7372  ' said Ron indignantly, having managed, finally, to swallow his food
[12847]666    I'm not allowed to ask a simple question
[12848]7410  'Oh, forget it,' said Hermione irritably, and the pair of them spent the rest of the meal in huffy silence
[12849]7846   Harry was too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile them; he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his way steadily through his steak and kidney pie, then a large plateful of his favourite treacle tart
[12850]2364   When all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the Hall was starting to creep upwards again, Dumbledore got to his feet once more
[12851]1100    Talking ceased immediately as all turned to face the Headmaster
[12852]5920    Harry was feeling pleasantly drowsy now
[12853]337    His four-poster bed was waiting somewhere above, wonderfully warm and soft 
[12854]0   
[12855]0   
[12856]6228   Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg a few moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices,' said Dumbledore
[12857]2304    First-years ought to know that the Forest in the grounds is out-of-bounds to students-and a few of our older students ought to know by now, too
[12858]9376   ' (Harry, Ron and Hermione exchanged smirks
[12859]372   )Mr
[12860]2132    Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the four-hundred-and-sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other things, all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr
[12861]5527    Filch's office door
[12862]185   We have had two changes in staffing this year
[12863]3333    We are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge, our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher
[12864]16148   'There was a round of polite but fairly unenthusiastic applause, during which Harry, Ron and Hermione exchanged slightly panicked looks; Dumbledore had not said for how long Grubbly-Plank would be teaching
[12865]3440   Dumbledore continued, Tryouts for the house Quidditch teams will take place on the-'He broke off, looking enquiringly at Professor Umbridge
[12866]4341    As she was not much taller standing than sitting, there was a moment when nobody understood why Dumbledore had stopped talking, but then Professor Umbridge cleared her throat, Hem, hem,' and it became clear that she had got to her feet and was intending to make a speech
[12867]4361   Dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment, then he sat down smartly and looked alertly at Professor Umbridge as though he desired nothing better than to listen to her talk
[12868]149    Other members of staff were not as adept at hiding their surprise
[12869]17648    Professor Sprout's eyebrows had disappeared into her flyaway hair and Professor McGonagall's mouth was as thin as Harry had ever seen it
[12870]1048    No new teacher had ever interrupted Dumbledore before
[12871]2088    Many of the students were smirking; this woman obviously did not know how things were done at Hogwarts
[12872]1643   Thank you, Headmaster,' Professor Umbridge simpered, for those kind words of welcome
[12873]8031   'Her voice was high-pitched, breathy and little-girlish and, again, Harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that he could not explain to himself; all he knew was that he loathed everything about her, from her stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan
[12874]748    She gave another little throat-clearing cough ('hem, hem') and continued
[12875]525   Well, it is lovely to be back at Hogwarts, I must say
[12876]174  ' She smiled, revealing very pointed teeth
[12877]992    And to see such happy little faces looking up at me
[12878]5791  'Harry glanced around
[12879]774    None of the faces he could see looked happy
[12880]1146    On the contrary, they all looked rather taken-aback at being addressed as though they were five years old
[12881]3187   I am very much looking forward to getting to know you all and I'm sure we'll be very good friends
[12882]328  'Students exchanged looks at this; some of them were barely concealing grins
[12883]4196   I'll be her friend as long as I don't have to borrow that cardigan,' Parvati whispered to Lavender, and both of them lapsed into silent giggles
[12884]2140   Professor Umbridge cleared her throat again ('hem, hem'), but when she continued, some of the breathiness had vanished from her voice
[12885]416    She sounded much more businesslike and now her words had a dull learned-by-heart sound to them
[12886]640   The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance
[12887]512    The rare gifts with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by careful instruction
[12888]217    The ancient skills unique to the wizarding community must be passed down the generations lest we lose them for ever
[12889]302    The treasure trove of magical knowledge amassed by our ancestors must be guarded, replenished and polished by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching
[12890]1775   'Professor Umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her fellow staff members, none of whom bowed back to her
[12891]15086    Professor McGonagall's dark eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively hawklike, and Harry distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance with Professor Sprout as Umbridge gave another little hem, hem' and went on with her speech
[12892]749   Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school, and that is as it should be, for without progress there will be stagnation and decay
[12893]4950    There again, progress for progress's sake must be discouraged, for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering
[12894]364    A balance, then, between old and new, between permanence and change, between tradition and innovation 
[12895]0   
[12896]0   
[12897]5798   'Harry found his attentiveness ebbing, as though his brain was slipping in and out of tune
[12898]1408    The quiet that always filled the Hall when Dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put their heads together, whispering and giggling
[12899]471    Over on the Ravenclaw table Cho Chang was chatting animatedly with her friends
[12900]1067    A few seats along from Cho, Luna Lovegood had got out The Quibbler again
[12901]13046    Meanwhile, at the Hufflepuff table Ernie Macmillan was one of the few still staring at Professor Umbridge, but he was glassy-eyed and Harry was sure he was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the new prefect's badge gleaming on his chest
[12902]2024   Professor Umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her audience
[12903]5940    Harry had the impression that a full-scale riot could have broken out under her nose and she would have ploughed on with her speech
[12904]2542    The teachers, however, were still listening very attentively, and Hermione seemed to be drinking in every word Umbridge spoke, though, judging by her expression, they were not at all to her taste
[12905]0   
[12906]0   
[12907]0   
[12908]1211    because some changes will be for the better, while others will come, in the fullness of time, to be recognised as errors of judgement
[12909]207    Meanwhile, some old habits will be retained, and rightly so, whereas others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned
[12910]694    Let us move forward, then, into a new era of openness, effectiveness and accountability, intent on preserving what ought to be preserved, perfecting what needs to be perfected, and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited
[12911]133   'She sat down
[12912]838    Dumbledore clapped
[12913]6250    The staff followed his lead, though Harry noticed that several of them brought their hands together only once or twice before stopping
[12914]1808    A few students joined in, but most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech, not having listened to more than a few words of it, and before they could start applauding properly, Dumbledore had stood up again
[12915]6460   Thank you very much, Professor Umbridge, that was most illuminating,' he said, bowing to her
[12916]318    Now, as I was saying, Quidditch tryouts will be held 
[12917]0   
[12918]0   
[12919]7660   ' Yes, it certainly was illuminating,' said Hermione in a low voice
[12920]101   You're not telling me you enjoyed it
[12921]9450  ' Ron said quietly, turning a glazed face towards Hermione
[12922]1139    That was about the dullest speech I've ever heard, and I grew up with Percy
[12923]11799   'I said illuminating, not enjoyable,' said Hermione
[12924]112    It explained a lot
[12925]667   ' Did it
[12926]10859  ' said Harry in surprise
[12927]806    Sounded like a load of waffle to me
[12928]6892   ' There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle,' said Hermione grimly
[12929]0   Was there
[12930]7110  ' said Ron blankly
[12931]4811   How about: progress for progress's sake must be discouraged"
[12932]80   How about: pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited"
[12933]320  'Well, what does that mean
[12934]7133  ' said Ron impatiently
[12935]7705   I'll tell you what it means,' said Hermione through gritted teeth
[12936]5257    It means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts
[12937]2727   'There was a great clattering and banging all around them; Dumbledore had obviously just dismissed the school, because everyone was standing up ready to leave the Hall
[12938]2274    Hermione jumped up, looking flustered
[12939]2261   Ron, we're supposed to show the first-years where to go
[12940]7813  'Oh yeah,' said Ron, who had obviously forgotten
[12941]143    Hey-hey, you lot
[12942]2   Midgets
[12943]2002  'Ron
[12944]1  'Well, they are, they're titchy 
[12945]0   
[12946]0   
[12947]3081   'I know, but you can't call them midgets
[12948]167  -First-years
[12949]1941  ' Hermione called commandingly along the table
[12950]355    This way, please
[12951]1239  'A group of new students walked shyly up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables, all of them trying hard not to lead the group
[12952]6975    They did indeed seem very small; Harry was sure he had not appeared that young when he had arrived here
[12953]15    He grinned at them
[12954]1039    A blond boy next to Euan Abercrombie looked petrified; he nudged Euan and whispered something in his ear
[12955]8506    Euan Abercrombie looked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at Harry, who felt the grin slide off his face like Stinksap
[12956]10277   See you later,' he said dully to Ron and Hermione and he made his way out of the Great Hall alone, doing everything he could to ignore more whispering, staring and pointing as he passed
[12957]2252    He kept his eyes fixed ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the Entrance Hall, then he hurried up the marble staircase, took a couple of concealed short cuts and had soon left most of the crowds behind
[12958]844   He had been stupid not to expect this, he thought angrily as he walked through the much emptier upstairs corridors
[12959]1363    Of course everyone was staring at him; he had emerged from the Triwizard maze two months previously clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming to have seen Lord Voldemort return to power
[12960]1974    There had not been time last term to explain himself before they'd all had to go home-even if he had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the terrible events in that graveyard
[12961]9151   Harry had reached the end of the corridor to the Gryffindor common room and come to a halt in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady before he realised that he did not know the new password
[12962]121   Er 
[12963]0   
[12964]0   
[12965]6077   ' he said glumly, staring up at the Fat Lady, who smoothed the folds of her pink satin dress and looked sternly back at him
[12966]5170   No password, no entrance,' she said loftily
[12967]6503   Harry, I know it
[12968]655  ' Someone panted up behind him and he turned to see Neville jogging towards him
[12969]7    Guess what it is
[12970]1592   I'm actually going to be able to remember it for once- ' He waved the stunted little cactus he had shown them on the train
[12971]10    Mimbuius mimbletonia
[12972]12994  'Correct,' said the Fat Lady, and her portrait swung open towards them like a door, revealing a circular hole in the wall behind, through which Harry and Neville now climbed
[12973]2170   The Gryffindor common room looked as welcoming as ever, a cosy circular tower room full of dilapidated squashy armchairs and rickety old tables
[12974]2915    A fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people were warming their hands by it before going up to their dormitories; on the other side of the room Fred and George Weasley were pinning something up on the noticeboard
[12975]6876    Harry waved goodnight to them and headed straight for the door to the boys' dormitories; he was not in much of a mood for talking at the moment
[12976]427    Neville followed him
[12977]484   Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan had reached the dormitory first and were in the process of covering the walls beside their beds with posters and photographs
[12978]7400    They had been talking as Harry pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment they saw him
[12979]5919    Harry wondered whether they had been talking about him, then whether he was being paranoid
[12980]5291   Hi,' he said, moving across to his own trunk and opening it
[12981]11034   Hey, Harry,' said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pyjamas in the West Ham colours
[12982]354    Good holiday
[12983]6796  'Not bad,' muttered Harry, as a true account of his holiday would have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it
[12984]0    You
[12985]433  'Yeah, it was OK,' chuckled Dean
[12986]5912    Better than Seamus's, anyway, he was just telling me
[12987]221   'Why, what happened, Seamus
[12988]743  ' Neville asked as he placed his Mimbuius mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinet
[12989]1518   Seamus did not answer immediately; he was making rather a meal of ensuring that his poster of the Kenmare Kestrels Quidditch team was quite straight
[12990]14631    Then he said, with his back still turned to Harry, Me mam didn't want me to come back
[12991]0   'What
[12992]11078  ' said Harry, pausing in the act of pulling off his robes
[12993]3719   She didn't want me to come back to Hogwarts
[12994]7363   'Seamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pyjamas out of his trunk, still not looking at Harry
[12995]0   But-why
[12996]10822  ' said Harry, astonished
[12997]5801    He knew that Seamus's mother was a witch and could not understand, therefore, why she should have come over so Dursleyish
[12998]903   Seamus did not answer until he had finished buttoning his pyjamas
[12999]5689   Well,' he said in a measured voice, I suppose 
[13000]0   
[13001]0   
[13002]0    because of you
[13003]852   'What d'you mean
[13004]10973  ' said Harry quickly
[13005]192   His heart was beating rather fast
[13006]331    He felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him
[13007]15808   Well,' said Seamus again, still avoiding Harry's eye, she 
[13008]0   
[13009]0   
[13010]121    er 
[13011]0   
[13012]0   
[13013]11125    well, it's not just you, it's Dumbledore, too 
[13014]0   
[13015]0   
[13016]119   'She believes the Daily Prophet
[13017]10818  ' said Harry
[13018]6267    She thinks I'm a liar and Dumbledore's an old fool
[13019]754  'Seamus looked up at him
[13020]1011   Yeah, something like that
[13021]10818   'Harry said nothing
[13022]1379    He threw his wand down on to his bedside table, pulled off his robes, stuffed them angrily into his trunk and pulled on his pyjamas
[13023]846    He was sick of it: sick of being the person who is stared at and talked about all the time
[13024]1682    If any of them knew, if any of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these things had happened to

[13026]0   
[13027]369    Mrs
[13028]647    Finnigan had no idea, the stupid woman, he thought savagely
[13029]6622   He got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him, but before he could do so, Seamus said, Look 
[13030]0   
[13031]0   
[13032]904    what did happen that night when 
[13033]0   
[13034]0   
[13035]771    you know, when 
[13036]0   
[13037]0   
[13038]55    with Cedric Diggory and all
[13039]736  'Seamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time
[13040]6852    Dean, who had been bending over his trunk trying to retrieve a slipper, went oddly still and Harry knew he was listening hard
[13041]31   What are you asking me for
[13042]5739  ' Harry retorted
[13043]4811    Just read the Daily Prophet like your mother, why don't you
[13044]1853   That'll tell you all you need to know
[13045]3156   'Don't you have a go at my mother,' Seamus snapped
[13046]11398   I'll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar,' said Harry
[13047]3795   Don't talk to me like that
[13048]12628  'I'll talk to you how I want,' said Harry, his temper rising so fast he snatched his wand back from his bedside table
[13049]1911    If you've got a problem sharing a dormitory with me, go and ask McGonagall if you can be moved 
[13050]0   
[13051]0   
[13052]812    stop your mummy worrying- 'Leave my mother out of this, Potter
[13053]5239  'What's going on
[13054]2120  'Ron had appeared in the doorway
[13055]7436    His wide eyes travelled from Harry, who was kneeling on his bed with his wand pointing at Seamus, to Seamus, who was standing there with his fists raised
[13056]4939   He's having a go at my mother
[13057]157  ' Seamus yelled
[13058]0   What
[13059]7088  ' said Ron
[13060]8332    Harry wouldn't do that-we met your mother, we liked her 
[13061]0   
[13062]0   
[13063]5073   'That's before she started believing every word the stinking Daily Prophet writes about me
[13064]11357  ' said Harry at the top of his voice
[13065]7981   Oh,' said Ron, comprehension dawning across his freckled face
[13066]362    Oh 
[13067]0   
[13068]0   
[13069]557    right
[13070]771   'You know what
[13071]11376  ' said Seamus heatedly, casting Harry a venomous look
[13072]13478    He's right, I don't want to share a dormitory with him any more, he's mad
[13073]12396   'That's out of order, Seamus,' said Ron, whose ears were starting to glow red-always a danger sign
[13074]152   Out of order, am I
[13075]2756  ' shouted Seamus, who in contrast with Ron was going pale
[13076]11020    You believe all the rubbish he's come out with about You-Know-Who, do you, you reckon he's telling the truth
[13077]277  'Yeah, I do
[13078]7171  ' said Ron angrily
[13079]5261   Then you're mad, too,' said Seamus in disgust
[13080]277   Yeah
[13081]526   Well, unfortunately for you, pal, I'm also a prefect
[13082]7177  ' said Ron, jabbing himself in the chest with a finger
[13083]679    So unless you want detention, watch your mouth
[13084]3373  'Seamus looked for a few seconds as though detention would be a reasonable price to pay to say what was going through his mind; but with a noise of contempt he turned on his heel, vaulted into bed and pulled the hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed and fell in a dusty pile to the floor
[13085]3158    Ron glared at Seamus, then looked at Dean and Neville
[13086]11262   Anyone else's parents got a problem with Harry
[13087]5093  ' he said aggressively
[13088]5298   My parents are Muggles, mate,' said Dean, shrugging
[13089]4802    They don't know nothing about no deaths at Hogwarts, because I'm not stupid enough to tell them
[13090]4424   'You don't know my mother, she'd weasel anything out of anyone
[13091]129  ' Seamus snapped at him
[13092]3115    Anyway, your parents don't get the Daily Prophet
[13093]18653   They don't know our Headmaster's been sacked from the Wizengamot and the International Confederation of Wizards because he's losing his marbles-'My gran says that's rubbish,' piped up Neville
[13094]11008    She says it's the Daily Prophet that's going downhill, not Dumbledore
[13095]4754    She's cancelled our subscription
[13096]11269    We believe Harry,' said Neville simply
[13097]1081    He climbed into bed and pulled the covers up to his chin, looking owlishly over them at Seamus
[13098]6455    My grans always said You-Know-Who would come back one day
[13099]10489    She says if Dumbledore says he's back, he's back
[13100]6344   'Harry felt a rush of gratitude towards Neville
[13101]5086    Nobody else said anything
[13102]1422    Seamus got out his wand, repaired the bed hangings and vanished behind them
[13103]1165    Dean got into bed, rolled over and fell silent
[13104]739    Neville, who appeared to have nothing more to say either, was gazing fondly at his moonlit cactus
[13105]8519   Harry lay back on his pillows while Ron bustled around the next bed, putting his things away
[13106]267    He fell, shaken by the argument with Seamus, whom he had always liked very much
[13107]897    How many more people were going to suggest that he was lying, or unhinged
[13108]1824  Had Dumbledore suffered like this all summer, as first the Wizengamot, then the International Confederation of Wizards had thrown him from their ranks
[13109]6901   Was it anger at Harry, perhaps, that had stopped Dumbledore getting in touch with him for months
[13110]6877   The two of them were in this together, after all; Dumbledore had believed Harry, announced his version of events to the whole school and then to the wider wizarding community
[13111]8328    Anyone who thought Harry was a liar had to think that Dumbledore was, too, or else that Dumbledore had been hoodwinked 
[13112]0   
[13113]0   
[13114]11198   They'll know we're right in the end, thought Harry miserably, as Ron got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormitory
[13115]6406    But he wondered how many more attacks like Seamus's he would have to endure before that time came

[13132]6288     Seamus dressed at top speed next morning and left the dormitory before Harry had even put on his socks
[13133]2095   Does he think he'll turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me too long
[13134]11340  ' asked Harry loudly as the hem of Seamus's robes wnipped out of sight
[13135]14580   Don't worry about it, Harry,' Dean muttered, hoisting his schoolbag on to his shoulder, he's just 
[13136]0   
[13137]0   
[13138]1307   'But apparently he was unable to say exactly what Seamus was, and after a slightly awkward pause followed him out of the room
[13139]19238   Neville and Ron both gave Harry an it's-his-problem-not-yours look, but Harry was not much consoled
[13140]0    How much more of this would he have to take
[13141]4836  What's the matter
[13142]10632  ' asked Hermione five minutes later, catching up with Harry and Ron halfway across the common room as they all headed towards breakfast
[13143]862    You look absolutely-Oh for heavens sake
[13144]1154   'She was staring at the common-room noticeboard, where a large new sign had been put up
[13145]23   GALLONS OF GALLEONS
[13146]72  Pocket money failing to keep pace with your outgoings
[13147]1109   Like to earn a little extra gold
[13148]2786  Contact Fred and George Weasley, Gryffindor common room,for simple, part-time, virtually painless jobs
[13149]4889   (We regret that all work is undertaken at applicant's own risk
[13150]7903   )They are the limit,' said Hermione grimly, taking down the sign, which Fred and George had pinned up ewer a poster giving the date of the first Hogsmeade weekend, which was to be in October
[13151]2689    We'll have to talk to them, Ron
[13152]2712   'Ron looked positively alarmed
[13153]0   Why
[13154]16  'Because we're prefects
[13155]6817  ' said Hermione, as they climbed out through the portrait hole
[13156]5155    It's up to us to stop this kind of thing
[13157]14379  'Ron said nothing; Harry could tell from his glum expression that the prospect of stopping Fred and George doing exactly what they liked was not one he found inviting
[13158]10482   Anyway, what's up, Harry
[13159]2382  ' Hermione continued, as they walked down a flight of stairs lined with portraits of old witches and wizards, all of whom ignored them, being engrossed in their own conversation
[13160]811    You look really angry about something
[13161]24918   'Seamus reckons Harry's lying about You-Know-Who,' said Ron succinctly, when Harry did not respond
[13162]7511   Hermione, who Harry had expected to react angrily on his behalf, sighed
[13163]5470   Yes, Lavender thinks so too,' she said gloomily
[13164]1037   Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I'm a lying, attention-seeking prat, have you
[13165]10954  ' Harry said loudly
[13166]6732   No,' said Hermione calmly
[13167]755    I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you, actually
[13168]10690    And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down our throats, Harry, because in case you haven't noticed, Ron and I are on your side
[13169]92   'There was a short pause
[13170]11539   Sorry,' said Harry in a low voice
[13171]12197   That's quite all right,' said Hermione with dignity
[13172]556    Then she shook her head
[13173]9236    Don't you remember what Dumbledore said at the last end-of-term feast
[13174]10079  ' Harry and Ron both looked at her blankly and Hermione sighed again
[13175]771   About You-Know-Who
[13176]5372    He said his gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great
[13177]1021    We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust- 'How do you remember stuff like that
[13178]2964  ' asked Ron, looking at her in admiration
[13179]8811   I listen, Ron,' said Hermione, with a touch of asperity
[13180]6046   So do I, but I still couldn't tell you exactly what-'The point,' Hermione pressed on loudly, is that this sort of thing is exactly what Dumbledore was talking about
[13181]6401    You-Know-Who's only been back two months and we've already started fighting among ourselves
[13182]14166    And the Sorting Hat's warning was the same: stand together, be united-'And Harry got it right last night,' retorted Ron
[13183]276    If that means we're supposed to get matey with the Slytherins-fat chance
[13184]12676   'Well, I think it's a pity we're not trying for a bit of inter-house unity,' said Hermione crossly
[13185]284   They had reached the foot of the marble staircase
[13186]6707    A line of fourth-year Ravenclaws was crossing the Entrance Hall; they caught sight of Harry and hurried to form a tighter group, as though frightened he might attack stragglers
[13187]12994   Yeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like that,' said Harry sarcastically
[13188]1519   They followed the Ravenclaws into the Great Hall, all looking instinctively at the staff table as they entered
[13189]2339    Professor Grubbly-Plank was chatting to Professor Sinistra, the Astronomy teacher, and Hagrid was once again conspicuous only by his absence
[13190]10728    The enchanted ceiling above them echoed Harry's mood; it was a miserable rain-cloud grey
[13191]14665   Dumbledore didn't even mention how long that Grubbly-Plank woman's staying,' he said, as they made their way across to the Gryffindor table
[13192]73   Maybe 
[13193]0   
[13194]0   
[13195]6714   ' said Hermione thoughtfully
[13196]0   What
[13197]12820  ' said both Harry and Ron together
[13198]0   Well 
[13199]0   
[13200]0   
[13201]3826    maybe he didn't want to draw attention to Hagrid not being here
[13202]910   ' What d'you mean, draw attention to it
[13203]7319  ' said Ron, half-laughing
[13204]32    How could we not notice
[13205]8293  'Before Hermione could answer, a tall black girl with long braided hair had marched up to Harry
[13206]113   Hi, Angelina
[13207]5540   'Hi,' she said briskly, good summer
[13208]1274  ' And without waiting for an answer, Listen, I've been made Gryffindor Quidditch Captain
[13209]20963   'Nice one,' said Harry, grinning at her; he suspected Angelina's pep talks might not be as long-winded as Oliver Wood's had been, which could only be an improvement
[13210]5663   Yeah, well, we need a new Keeper now Oliver's left
[13211]1165    Tryouts are on Friday at five o'clock and I want the whole team there, all right
[13212]816   Then we can see how the new person'll fit in
[13213]10900   'OK,' said Harry
[13214]130   Angelina smiled at him and departed
[13215]10078   I'd forgotten Wood had left,' said Hermione vaguely as she sat down beside Ron and pulled a plate of toast towards her
[13216]560    I suppose that will make quite a difference to the team
[13217]15781  'I s'pose,' said Harry, taking the bench opposite
[13218]365    He was a good Keeper 
[13219]0   
[13220]0   
[13221]2744   'Still, it won't hurt to have some new blood, will it
[13222]7088  ' said Ron
[13223]401   With a whoosh and a clatter, hundreds of owls came soaring in through the upper windows
[13224]702    They descended all over the Hall, bringing letters and packages to their owners and showering the breakfasters with droplets of water; it was clearly raining hard outside
[13225]7946    Hedwig was nowhere to be seen, but Harry was hardly surprised; his only correspondent was Sirius, and he doubted Sirius would have anything new to tell him after only twenty-four hours apart
[13226]2899    Hermione, however, had to move her orange juice aside quickly to make way gor a large damp barn owl bearing a sodden Daily Prophet in its beak
[13227]113   What are you still getting that for
[13228]17769  ' said Harry irritably, thinking of Seamus as Hermione placed a Knut in the leather pouch on the owl's leg and it took off again
[13229]450    I'm not bothering 
[13230]0   
[13231]0   
[13232]43    load of rubbish
[13233]20357   'It's best to know what the enemy is saying,' said Hermione darkly, and she unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind it, not emerging until Harry and Ron had finished eating
[13234]5208   Nothing,' she said simply, rolling up the newspaper and laying it down by her plate
[13235]817    Nothing about you or Dumbledore or anything
[13236]1332   'Professor McGonagall was now moving along the table handing out timetables
[13237]521   Look at today

[13244]0   
[13245]0   
[13246]91   'Do mine ears deceive me
[13247]11666  ' said Fred, arriving with George and squeezing on to the bench beside Harry
[13248]3339    Hogwarts prefects surely don't wish to skive off lessons
[13249]14301  'Look what we've got today,' said Ron grumpily, shoving his timetable under Fred's nose
[13250]5676    That's the worst Monday I've ever seen
[13251]5912   'Fair point, little bro,' said Fred, scanning the column
[13252]938    You can have a bit of Nosebleed Nougat cheap if you like
[13253]4753   'Why's it cheap
[13254]7099  ' said Ron suspiciously
[13255]9226   Because you'll keep bleeding till you shrivel up, we haven't got an antidote yet,' said George, helping himself to a kipper
[13256]8302   Cheers,' said Ron moodily, pocketing his timetable, but I think I'll take the lessons
[13257]10102   'And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,' said Hermione, eyeing Fred and George beadily, you can't advertise for testers on the Gryffindor noticeboard
[13258]86   ' Says who
[13259]6073  ' said George, looking astonished
[13260]6787   Says me,' said Hermione
[13261]2002    And Ron
[13262]7252   'Leave me out of it,' said Ron hastily
[13263]1643   Hermione glared at him
[13264]817    Fred and George sniggered
[13265]7857   You'll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione,' said Fred, thickly buttering a crumpet
[13266]1179    You're starting your fifth year, you'll be begging us for a Snackbox before long
[13267]831   'And why would starting fifth year mean I want a Skiving Snackbox

[13269]10707   Fifth year's OWL year,' said George
[13270]0   So
[13271]3955  'So you've got your exams coming up, haven't you
[13272]6900   They'll be keeping your noses so hard to that grindstone they'll be rubbed raw,' said Fred with satisfaction
[13273]6030   Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to OWLs,' said George happily
[13274]46    Tears and tantrums

[13280]956   'Kenneth Towler came out in boils, d'you remember
[13281]5515  ' said Fred remmiscently
[13282]10279   That's cause you put Bulbadox powder in his pyjamas,' said George
[13283]6196   Oh yeah,' said Fred, grinning
[13284]662    I'd forgotten

[13287]2588    hard to keep track sometimes, isn't it
[13288]10434  'Anyway, it's a nightmare of a year, the fifth,' said George
[13289]115    If you care about exam results, anyway
[13290]493    Fred and I managed to keep our peckers up somehow
[13291]277   ' Yeah 
[13292]0   
[13293]0   
[13294]753    you got, what was it, three OWLs each
[13295]7088  ' said Ron
[13296]5522   Yep,' said Fred unconcernedly
[13297]341    But we feel our futures lie outside the world of academic achievement
[13298]14776   'We seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for our seventh year,' said George brightly, now that we've got-'He broke off at a warning look from Harry, who knew George had been about to mention the Triwizard winnings he had given them
[13299]6952   -now that we've got our OWLs,' George said hastily
[13300]710    I mean, do we really need NEWTs
[13301]8712   But we didn't think Mum could take us leaving school early not on top of Percy turning out to be the world's biggest prat
[13302]7259   'We're not going to waste our last year here, though,' said Fred, looking affectionately around at the Great Hall
[13303]1345    We're going to use it to do a bit of market research, find out exactly what the average Hogwarts student requires from a joke shop, carefully evaluate the results of our research, then produce products to fit the demand
[13304]690   'But where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop
[13305]1976  ' Hermione asked sceptically
[13306]753    You're going to need all the ingredients and materials-and premises too, I suppose 
[13307]0   
[13308]0   
[13309]6883   'Harry did not look at the twins
[13310]966    His face felt hot; he deliberately dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it
[13311]3677    He heard Fred say overhead, Ask us no questions and we'll tell you no lies, Hermione
[13312]742    C'mon, George, if we get there early we might be able to sell a few Extendable Ears before Herbology
[13313]7269   'Harry emerged from under the table to see Fred and George walking away, each carrying a stack of toast
[13314]898   What did that mean

[13324]6406   'Harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these dangerous waters
[13325]11184   D'you reckon it's true this year's going to be really tough
[13326]28   Because of the exams
[13327]7727  'Oh, yeah,' said Ron
[13328]2443    Bound to be, isn't it
[13329]416   OWLs are really important, affect the jobs you can apply for and everything
[13330]651    We get career advice, too, later this year, Bill told me
[13331]534    So you can choose what NEWTs you want to do next year
[13332]1967   'D'you know what you want to do after Hogwarts
[13333]7267  ' Harry asked the other two, as they left the Great Hall shortly afterwards and set off towards their History of Magic classroom
[13334]7502   Not really,' said Ron slowly
[13335]0    Except

[13342]0   What
[13343]5738  ' Harry urged him
[13344]8663   Well, it'd be cool to be an Auror,' said Ron in an off-hand voice
[13345]11098   Yeah, it would,' said Harry fervently
[13346]7823   But they're, like, the elite,' said Ron
[13347]2014    You've got to be really good
[13348]1615    What about you, Hermione
[13349]8798  'I don't know,' she said
[13350]2208    I think I'd like to do something really worthwhile
[13351]4773   'An Auror's worthwhile
[13352]10818  ' said Harry
[13353]12181   Yes, it is, but it's not the only worthwhile thing,' said Hermione thoughtfully, I mean, if I could take SPEW further 
[13354]0   
[13355]0   
[13356]8404   'Harry and Ron carefully avoided looking at each other
[13357]401   History of Magic was by common consent the most boring subject ever devised by wizardkind
[13358]1612    Professor Binns, their ghost teacher, had a wheezy, droning voice that was almost guaranteed to cause severe drowsiness within ten minutes, five in warm weather
[13359]395    He never varied the form of their lessons, but lectured them without pausing while they took notes, or rather, gazed sleepily into space
[13360]19927    Harry and Ron had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying Hermione's notes before exams; she alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of Binns's voice
[13361]5184   Today, they suffered an hour and a half's droning on the subject of giant wars
[13362]16597    Harry heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher's hands this subject might have been mildly interesting, but then his brain disengaged, and he spent the remaining hour and twenty minutes playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with Ron, while Hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye
[13363]1370   How would it be,' she asked them coldly, as they left the classroom for break (Binns drifting away through the blackboard), if I refused to lend you my notes this year
[13364]7822  'We'd fail our OWL, said Ron
[13365]1953    If you want that on your conscience, Hermione 
[13366]0   
[13367]0   
[13368]676   'Well, you'd deserve it,' she snapped
[13369]3102    You don't even try to listen to him, do you
[13370]7174  'We do try,' said Ron
[13371]4878    We just haven't got your brains or your memory or your concentration- you're just cleverer than we are-is it nice to rub it in
[13372]11304  'Oh, don't give me that rubbish,' said Hermione, but she looked slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard
[13373]1292   A fine misty drizzle was falling, so that the people standing in huddles around the edges of the yard looked blurred at the edges
[13374]10952    Harry, Ron and Hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony, turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air and talking about what Snape was likely to set them in the first lesson of the year
[13375]2121    They had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be something extremely difficult, just to catch them off guard after a two-month holiday, when someone walked around the corner towards them
[13376]5768   Hello, Harry
[13377]165  'It was Cho Chang and, what was more, she was on her own again
[13378]6394    This was most unusual: Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls; Harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by herself to ask her to the Yule Ball
[13379]11586   Hi,' said Harry, feeling his face grow hot
[13380]950    At least you're not covered in Stinksap this time, he told himself
[13381]259    Cho seemed to be thinking along the same lines
[13382]760   You got that stuff off, then
[13383]11514  'Yeah,' said Harry, trying to grin as though the memory of their last meeting was funny as opposed to mortifying
[13384]667    So, did you 
[13385]0   
[13386]0   
[13387]121    er 
[13388]0   
[13389]0   
[13390]407    have a good summer
[13391]23472  'The moment he had said this he wished he hadn't-Cedric had been Cho's boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her holiday almost as badly as it had affected Harry's
[13392]7298    Something seemed to tauten in her face, but she said, Oh, it was all right, you know 
[13393]0   
[13394]0   
[13395]39   'Is that a Tornados badge
[13396]9834  ' Ron demanded suddenly, pointing to the front of Cho's robes, where a sky-blue badge emblazoned with a double gold T' was pinned
[13397]2963    You don't support them, do you
[13398]5513  'Yeah, I do,' said Cho
[13399]948   Have you always supported them, or just since they started winning the league
[13400]13415  ' said Ron, in what Harry considered an unnecessarily accusatory tone of voice
[13401]5961   I've supported them since I was six,' said Cho coolly
[13402]0    Anyway 
[13403]0   
[13404]0   
[13405]5732    see you, Harry
[13406]500   'She walked away
[13407]3866    Hermione waited until Cho was halfway across the courtyard before rounding on Ron
[13408]3   You are so tactless
[13409]0  'What
[13410]9150   I only asked her if-'Couldn't you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her own
[13411]0  'So
[13412]3455   She could've done, I wasn't stopping-'Why on earth were you attacking her about her Quidditch team
[13413]17  'Attacking
[13414]2482   I wasn't attacking her, I was only-'Who cares if she supports the Tornados
[13415]1564  'Oh, come on, half the people you see wearing those badges only bought them last season-'But what does it matter
[13416]20525  'It means they're not real fans, they're just jumping on the bandwagon-' That's the bell,' said Harry dully, because Ron and Hermione were bickering too loudly to hear it
[13417]10966    They did not stop arguing all the way down to Snapes dungeon, which gave Harry plenty of time to reflect that between Neville and Ron he would be lucky ever to have two minutes of conversation with Cho that he could look back on without wanting to leave the country
[13418]9312   And yet, he thought, as they joined the queue lining up outside Snape's classroom door, she had chosen to come and talk to him, hadn't she
[13419]17235   She had been Cedric's girlfriend; she could easily have hated Harry for coming out of the Triwizard maze alive when Cedric had died, yet she was talking to him in a perfectly friendly way, not as though she thought him mad, or a liar, or in some horrible way responsible for Cedric's death 
[13420]0   
[13421]0   
[13422]1680    yes, she had definitely chosen to come and talk to him, and that made the second time in two days 
[13423]0   
[13424]0   
[13425]10925    and at this thought, Harry's spirits rose
[13426]7029    Even the ominous sound of Snape's dungeon door creaking open did not puncture the small, hopeful bubble that seemed to have swelled in his chest
[13427]7900    He filed into the classroom behind Ron and Hermione and followed them to their usual table at the back, where he sat down between Ron and Hermione and ignored the huffy, irritable noises now issuing from both of them
[13428]6106   Settle down,' said Snape coldly, shutting the door behind him
[13429]1858   There was no real need for the call to order; the moment the class had heard the door close, quiet had fallen and all fidgeting stopped
[13430]10272    Snape's mere presence was usually enough to ensure a class's silence
[13431]11880   Before we begin today's lesson,' said Snape, sweeping over to his desk and staring around at them all, I think it appropriate to remind you that next June you will be sitting an important examination, during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of magical potions
[13432]326    Moronic though some of this class undoubtedly are, I expect you to scrape an Acceptable in your OWL, or suffer my 
[13433]0   
[13434]0   
[13435]2    displeasure
[13436]895   'His gaze lingered this time on Neville, who gulped
[13437]1079   After this year, of course, many of you will cease studying with me,' Snape went on
[13438]495    I take only the very best into my NEWT Potions class, which means that some of us will certainly be saying goodbye
[13439]6263   'His eyes rested on Harry and his lip curled
[13440]6463    Harry glared back, feeling a grim pleasure at the idea that he would be able to give up Potions after fifth year
[13441]7113   But we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell,' said Snape softly, so, whether or not you are intending to attempt NEWT, I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the high pass level I have come to expect from my OWL students
[13442]357   Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation
[13443]726    Be warned: if you are too heavy-handed with the ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irreversible sleep, so you will need to pay close attention to what you are doing
[13444]12910   ' On Harry's left, Hermione sat up a little straighter, her expression one of utmost attention
[13445]7789    The ingredients and method-' Snape flicked his wand -are on the blackboard-(they appeared there) -you will find everything you need-' he flicked his wand again -in the store cupboard-' (the door of the said cupboard sprang open) -you have an hour and a half 
[13446]0   
[13447]0   
[13448]75    start
[13449]10934   'Just as Harry, Ron and Hermione had predicted, Snape could hardly have set them a more difficult, fiddly potion
[13450]2785    The ingredients had to be added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quantities; the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of times, firstly in clockwise, then in anti-clockwise directions; the heat of the flames on which it was simmering had to be lowered to exactly the right level for a specific number of minutes before the final ingredient was added
[13451]1319   A light silver vapour should now be rising from your potion,' called Snape, with ten minutes left to go
[13452]6479   Harry, who was sweating profusely, looked desperately around the dungeon
[13453]7272    His own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark grey steam; Ron's was spitting green sparks
[13454]1106    Seamus was feverishly prodding the flames at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand, as they seemed to be going out
[13455]7948    The surface of Hermione's potion, however, was a shimmering mist of silver vapour, and as Snape swept by he looked down his hooked nose at it without comment, which meant he could find nothing to criticise
[13456]12378   At Harry's cauldron, however, Snape stopped, and looked down at it with a horrible smirk on his face
[13457]553   Potter, what is this supposed to be
[13458]7200  'The Slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly; they loved hearing Snape taunt Harry
[13459]10839   The Draught of Peace,' said Harry tensely
[13460]6533   Tell me, Potter,' said Snape softly, can you read
[13461]553  'Draco Malfoy laughed
[13462]11651   Yes, I can,' said Harry, his fingers clenched tightly around his wand
[13463]648   Read the third line of the instructions for me, Potter
[13464]6075   'Harry squinted at the blackboard; it was not easy to make out the instructions through the haze of multi-coloured steam now filling the dungeon
[13465]332   "Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counter-clockwise, allow to simmer for seven minutes then add two drops of syrup of hellebore
[13466]139    'His heart sank
[13467]520    He had not added syrup of hellebore, but had proceeded straight to the fourth line of the instructions after allowing his potion to simmer for seven minutes
[13468]1171   Did you do everything on the third line, Potter
[13469]10955  'No,' said Harry very quietly
[13470]16   I beg your pardon
[13471]10954  'No,' said Harry, more loudly
[13472]24    I forgot the hellebore
[13473]1971   'I know you did, Potter, which means that this mess is utterly worthless
[13474]2    Evanesce
[13475]11085   'The contents of Harry's potion vanished; he was left standing foolishly beside an empty cauldron
[13476]6094   Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name and bring it up to my desk for testing,' said Snape
[13477]451    Homework: twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday
[13478]6280   'While everyone around him filled their flagons, Harry cleared away his things, seething
[13479]24179    His potion had been no worse than Ron's, which was now giving off a foul odour of bad eggs; or Neville's, which had achieved the consistency of just-mixed cement and which Neville was now having to gouge out of his cauldron; yet it was he, Harry, who would be receiving zero marks for the day's work
[13480]6140    He stuffed his wand back into his bag and slumped down on to his seat, watching everyone else march up to Snape's desk with filled and corked flagons
[13481]11027    When at long last the bell rang, Harry was first out of the dungeon and had already started his lunch by the time Ron and Hermione joined him in the Great Hall
[13482]545    The ceiling had turned an even murkier grey during the morning
[13483]219    Rain was lashing the high windows
[13484]17635   That was really unfair,' said Hermione consolingly, sitting down next to Harry and helping herself to shepherd's pie
[13485]8040    Your potion wasn't nearly as bad as Goyle's; when he put it in his flagon the whole thing shattered and set his robes on fire
[13486]11623   'Yeah, well,' said Harry, glowering at his plate, since when has Snape ever been fair to me
[13487]17705  'Neither of the others answered; all three of them knew that Snape and Harry's mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment Harry had set foot in Hogwarts
[13488]9040   I did think he might be a bit better this year,' said Hermione in a disappointed voice
[13489]231    I mean 
[13490]0   
[13491]0   
[13492]771    you know 
[13493]0   
[13494]0   
[13495]1196   ' she looked around carefully; there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of them and nobody was passing the table ' 
[13496]0   
[13497]0   
[13498]4902    now he's in the Order and everything
[13499]10078   'Poisonous toadstools don't change their spots,' said Ron sagely
[13500]2407    Anyway, I've always thought Dumbledore was cracked to trust Snape
[13501]5980    Where's the evidence he ever really stopped working for You-Know-Who
[13502]13015  'I think Dumbledore's probably got plenty of evidence, even if he doesn't share it with you, Ron,' snapped Hermione
[13503]13753   Oh, shut up, the pair of you,' said Harry heavily, as Ron opened his mouth to argue back
[13504]4302    Hermione and Ron both froze, looking angry and offended
[13505]2416    Can't you give it a rest
[13506]10818  ' said Harry
[13507]4944    You're always having a go at each other, it's driving me mad
[13508]5328   ' And abandoning his shepherd's pie, he swung his schoolbag back over his shoulder and left them sitting there
[13509]1226   He walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time, past the many students hurrying towards lunch
[13510]9652    The anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still blazed inside him, and the vision of Ron and Hermione's shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction
[13511]3368    Serve them right, he thought, why can't they give it a rest 
[13512]0   
[13513]0   
[13514]560    bickering all the time 
[13515]0   
[13516]0   
[13517]4926    it's enough to drive anyone up the wall 
[13518]0   
[13519]0   
[13520]6536   He passed the large picture of Sir Cadogan the knight on a landing; Sir Cadogan drew his sword and brandished it fiercely at Harry, who ignored him
[13521]462   Come back, you scurvy dog
[13522]174   Stand fast and fight
[13523]7927  ' yelled Sir Cadogan in a muffled voice from behind his visor, but Harry merely walked on and when Sir Cadogan attempted to follow him by running into a neighbouring picture, he was rebuffed by its inhabitant, a large and angry-looking wolfhound
[13524]6178   Harry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the trapdoor at the top of North Tower
[13525]5135    Consequently, he was the first to ascend the silver ladder that led to Sybill Trelawney's classroom when the bell rang
[13526]16558   After Potions, Divination was Harry's least favourite class, which was due mainly to Professor Trelawney's habit of predicting his premature death every few lessons
[13527]6545    A thin woman, heavily draped in shawls and glittering with strings of beads, she always reminded Harry of some kind of insect, with her glasses hugely magnifying her eyes
[13528]8037    She was busy putting copies of battered leather-bound books on each of the spindly little tables with which her room was littered when Harry entered the room, but the light cast by the lamps covered by scarves and the low-burning, sickly-scented fire was so dim she appeared not to notice him as he took a seat in the shadows
[13529]430    The rest of the class arrived over the next five minutes
[13530]9107    Ron emerged from the trapdoor, looked around carefully, spotted Harry and made directly for him, or as directly as he could while having to wend his way between tables, chairs and overstuffed pouffes
[13531]12684   Hermione and me have stopped arguing,' he said, sitting down beside Harry
[13532]6095   Good,' grunted Harry
[13533]9174   But Hermione says she thinks it would be nice if you stopped taking out your temper on us,' said Ron
[13534]8982   I m not-'I'm just passing on the message,' said Ron, talking over him
[13535]5357    But I reckon she's right
[13536]5344    It's not our fault how Seamus and Snape treat you
[13537]18295   'I never said it -'Good-day,' said Professor Trelawney in her usual misty, dreamy voice, and Harry broke off, again feeling both annoyed and slightly ashamed of himself
[13538]54    And welcome back to Divination
[13539]1174    I have, of course, been following your fortunes most carefully over the holidays, and am delighted to see that you have all returned to Hogwarts safely-as, of course, I knew you would
[13540]116   You will find on the tables before you copies of The Dream Oracle, by Inigo Imago
[13541]345    Dream interpretation is a most important means of divining the future and one that may very probably be tested in your OWL
[13542]403    Not, of course, that I believe examination passes or failures are of the remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of divination
[13543]582    If you have the Seeing Eye, certificates and grades matter very little
[13544]129    However, the Headmaster likes you to sit the examination, so 
[13545]0   
[13546]0   
[13547]1909   'Her voice trailed away delicately, leaving them all in no doubt that Professor Trelawney considered her subject above such sordid matters as examinations
[13548]619   Turn, please, to the introduction and read what Imago has to say on the matter of dream interpretation
[13549]16    Then, divide into pairs
[13550]4968    Use The Dream Oracle to interpret each other's most recent dreams
[13551]21    Carry on
[13552]5718   'The one good thing to be said for this lesson was that it was not a double period
[13553]1269    By the time they had all finished reading the introduction of the book, they had barely ten minutes left for dream interpretation
[13554]22351    At the table next to Harry and Ron, Dean had paired up with Neville, who immediately embarked on a long-winded explanation of a nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his grandmother's best hat; Harry and Ron merely looked at each other glumly
[13555]7496   I never remember my dreams,' said Ron, you say one
[13556]10968   'You must remember one of them,' said Harry impatiently
[13557]529   He was not going to share his dreams with anyone
[13558]3796    He knew perfectly well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant, he did not need Ron or Proiessor Trelawney or the stupid Dream Oracle to tell him
[13559]8128   Well, I dreamed I was playing Quidditch the other night,' said Ron, screwing up his face in an effort to remember
[13560]716    What d'you reckon that means
[13561]11615  'Probably that you're going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something,' said Harry, turning the pages of The Dream Oracle without interest
[13562]7794    It was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the Oracle and Harry was not cheered up when Professor Trelawney set them the task of keeping a dream diary for a month as homework
[13563]4809    When the bell went, he and Ron led the way back down the ladder, Ron grumbling loudly
[13564]2097   D'you realise how much homework we've got already
[13565]7936   Binns set us a foot-and-a-half-long essay on giant wars, Snape wants a foot on the use of moonstones, and now we've got a month's dream diary from Trelawney
[13566]3520   Fred and George weren't wrong about OWL year, were they
[13567]815   That Umbridge woman had better not give us any

[13569]0   
[13570]3175   'When they entered the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom they found Professor Umbridge already seated at the teachers desk, wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black velvet bow on top of her head
[13571]6064    Harry was again reminded forcibly of a large fly perched unwisely on top of an even larger toad
[13572]2346   The class was quiet as it entered the room; Professor Umbridge was, as yet, an unknown quantity and nobody knew how strict a disciplinarian she was likely to be
[13573]382   Well, good afternoon
[13574]5422  ' she said, when finally the whole class had sat down
[13575]728   A few people mumbled good afternoon' in reply
[13576]6422   Tut, tut,' said Professor Umbridge
[13577]2444    That won't do, now, will it
[13578]2449   I should like you, please, to reply Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge"
[13579]556    One more time, please
[13580]526    Good afternoon, class
[13581]1706  'Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,' they chanted back at her
[13582]6423   There, now,' said Professor Umbridge sweetly
[13583]2498    That wasn't too difficult, was it
[13584]406   Wands away and quills out, please
[13585]1020   'Many of the class exchanged gloomy looks; the order wands away' had never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting
[13586]6865    Harry shoved his wand back inside his bag and pulled cut quill, ink and parchment
[13587]5165    Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, extracted her own wand, which was an unusually short one, and tapped the blackboard sharply with it; words appeared on the board at once:Defence Against the Dark ArtsA Return to Basic PrinciplesWell now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn't it
[13588]2263  ' stated Professor Umbridge, turning to face the class with her hands clasped neatly in front of her
[13589]940    The constant changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your OWL year
[13590]837   You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to be rectified
[13591]977    We will be following a carefully structured, theory-centred, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year
[13592]68    Copy down the following, please
[13593]349   'She rapped the blackboard again; the first message vanished and was replaced by:Course Aims:1
[13594]250    Understanding the principles underlying defensive magic
[13595]0   2
[13596]338    Learning to recognise situations in which defensive magic can legally be used3
[13597]463    Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use
[13598]865   For a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment
[13599]7576    When everyone had copied down Professor Umbridge's three course aims she asked, Has everybody got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard
[13600]183  'There was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class
[13601]7623   I think we'll try that again,' said Professor Umbridge
[13602]3843    When I ask you a question, I should like you to reply, Yes, Professor Umbridge", or No, Professor Umbridge"
[13603]879    So: has everyone got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard
[13604]2097  'Yes, Professor Umbridge,' rang through the room
[13605]6751   Good,' said Professor Umbridge
[13606]1163    I should like you to turn to page five and read Chapter One, Basics for Beginners"
[13607]303    There will be no need to talk
[13608]12017   'Professor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the chair behind the teacher's desk, observing them all closely with those pouchy toad's eyes
[13609]6532    Harry turned to page five of his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and started to read
[13610]1187   It was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns
[13611]1399    He felt his concentration sliding away from him; he had soon read the same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few words
[13612]283    Several silent minutes passed
[13613]2485    Next to him, Ron was absent-mindedly turning his quill over and over in his fingers, staring at the same spot on the page
[13614]7051    Harry looked right and received a surprise to shake him out of his torpor
[13615]1962    Hermione had not even opened her copy of Defensive Magical Theory
[13616]2020   She was staring fixedly at Professor Umbridge with her hand in the air
[13617]8250   Harry could not remember Hermione ever neglecting to read when instructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came under her nose
[13618]4448    He looked at her enquiringly, but she merely shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to answer questions, and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who was looking just as resolutely in another direction
[13619]7716   After several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the only one watching Hermione
[13620]13407    The chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch Hermione's mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge's eye rather than struggle on with Basics for Beginners'
[13621]3625   When more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather than at their books, Professor Umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the situation no longer
[13622]1378   Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear
[13623]2852  ' she asked Hermione, as though she had only just noticed her
[13624]6877   Not about the chapter, no,' said Hermione
[13625]7585   Well, we're reading just now,' said Professor Umbridge, showing her small pointed teeth
[13626]405    If you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class
[13627]8307   'I've got a query about your course aims,' said Hermione
[13628]1489   Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows
[13629]0   And your name is
[13630]8365  'Hermione Granger,' said Hermione
[13631]8161   Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully,' said Professor Umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness
[13632]9646   Well, I don't,' said Hermione bluntly
[13633]4893    There's nothing written up there about using defensive spells
[13634]1000   'There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard
[13635]104   Using defensive spells
[13636]1717  ' Professor Umbridge repeated with a little laugh
[13637]2697    Why, I can't imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger
[13638]2617    You surely aren't expecting to be attacked during class
[13639]803  'We're not going to use magic
[13640]2142  ' Ron exclaimed loudly
[13641]975   Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr
[13642]0   -
[13643]8247  ' Weasley,' said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air
[13644]1738   Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on him
[13645]7690    Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too
[13646]14189    Professor Umbridge's pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before she addressed Hermione
[13647]406   Yes, Miss Granger
[13648]283   You wanted to ask something else
[13649]6993  'Yes,' said Hermione
[13650]653    Surely the whole point of Defence Against the Dark Arts is to practise defensive spells
[13651]361  'Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger
[13652]2238  ' asked Professor Umbridge, in her falsely sweet voice
[13653]734   No, but-'Well then, I'm afraid you are not qualified to decide what the whole point of any class is
[13654]290    Wizards much older and cleverer than you have devised our new programme of study
[13655]635    You will be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way-'What use is that
[13656]10954  ' said Harry loudly
[13657]4180    If we're going to be attacked, it won't be in a-'Hand,Mr Potter
[13658]1328  ' sang Professor Umbridge
[13659]5925   Harry thrust his fist in the air
[13660]2497    Again, Professor Umbridge promptly turned away from him, but now several other people had their hands up, too
[13661]0   And your name is
[13662]6476  ' Professor Umbridge said to Dean
[13663]87   Dean Thomas
[13664]391   'Well, Mr Thomas
[13665]18711  'Well, it's like Harry said, isn't it
[13666]5154  ' said Dean
[13667]3072    If we're going to be attacked, it won't be risk free
[13668]6703   'I repeat,' said Professor Umbridge, smiling in a very irritating fashion at Dean, do you expect to be attacked during my classes
[13669]1339  'No, but-'Professor Umbridge talked over him
[13670]7459    I do not wish to criticise the way things have been run in this school,' she said, an unconvincing smile stretching her wide mouth, but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class, very irresponsible indeed-not to mention,' she gave a nasty little laugh, extremely dangerous half-breeds
[13671]2141   'If you mean Professor Lupin,' piped up Dean angrily, he was the best we ever-Hand,Mr Thomas
[13672]243   As I was saying-you have been introduced to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group and potentially lethal
[13673]11015    You have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day-'No we haven't,' Hermione said, we just-'Your hand is not up, Miss Granger
[13674]1971  'Hermione put up her hand
[13675]1998    Professor Umbridge turned away from her
[13676]98   It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you
[13677]3045   'Well, he turned out to be a maniac, didn't he
[13678]5162  ' said Dean hotly
[13679]202    Mind you, we still learned loads
[13680]728   'Your hand is not up, Mr
[13681]19    Thomas
[13682]1323  ' trilled Professor Umbridge
[13683]528    Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which, after all, is what school is all about
[13684]0    And your name is
[13685]1530  ' she added, staring at Parvati, whose hand had just shot up
[13686]3222   Parvati Patil, and isn't there a practical bit in our Defence Against the Dark Arts OWL
[13687]2669   Aren't we supposed to show that we can actually do the counter-curses and things
[13688]7285  'As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions,' said Professor Umbridge dismissively
[13689]14   Without ever practising them beforehand
[13690]5147  ' said Parvati incredulously
[13691]1291    Are you telling us that the first time we'll get to do the spells will be during our exam
[13692]6277  'I repeat, as long as you have studied the theory hard enough-'And what good's theory going to be in the real world
[13693]11133  ' said Harry loudly, his fist in the air again
[13694]1998   Professor Umbridge looked up
[13695]597   This is school, Mr
[13696]5709    Potter, not the real world,' she said softly
[13697]4934   So we're not supposed to be prepared for what's waiting for us out there
[13698]456  ' There is nothing waiting out there, Mr
[13699]461    Potter
[13700]639   'Oh, yeah
[13701]10818  ' said Harry
[13702]1177    His temper, which seemed to have been bubbling just beneath the surface all day, was reaching boiling point
[13703]880   Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves
[13704]1890  ' enquired Professor Umbridge in a horribly honeyed voice
[13705]5636   Hmm, let's think 
[13706]0   
[13707]0   
[13708]11366   ' said Harry in a mock thoughtful voice
[13709]73    Maybe 
[13710]0   
[13711]0   
[13712]320    Lord Voldemort
[13713]2818  'Ron gasped; Lavender Brown uttered a little scream; Neville slipped sideways off his stool
[13714]1990    Professor Umbridge, however, did not flinch
[13715]6545    She was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on her face
[13716]614   Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr
[13717]461    Potter
[13718]102   'The classroom was silent and still
[13719]6480    Everyone was staring at either Umbridge or Harry
[13720]859   Now, let me make a few things quite plain
[13721]1843   'Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned towards them, her stubby-fingered hands splayed on her desk
[13722]19489   You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead-'He wasn't dead,' said Harry angrily, but yeah, he's returned
[13723]8531  'Mr-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-house-ten-points-do-not-make-matters-worse-for-yourself,' said Professor Umbridge in one breath without looking at him
[13724]817    As I was saying, you have been informed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again
[13725]22    This is a lie
[13726]22   'It is NOT a lie
[13727]10818  ' said Harry
[13728]345    I saw him, I fought him
[13729]877  'Detention, Mr Potter
[13730]6413  ' said Professor Umbridge triumphantly
[13731]123    Tomorrow evening
[13732]160    Five o'clock
[13733]170    My office
[13734]30    I repeat, this is a lie
[13735]919   The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark wizard
[13736]849    If you are still worried, by all means come and see me outside class hours
[13737]1346    If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it
[13738]145    I am here to help
[13739]61    I am your friend
[13740]92    And now, you will kindly continue your reading
[13741]55    Page five, Basics for Beginners"
[13742]1591   'Professor Umbridge sat down behind her desk
[13743]5888    Harry, however, stood up
[13744]1316    Everyone was staring at him; Seamus looked half-scared, half-fascinated
[13745]5732   Harry, no
[13746]8214  ' Hermione whispered in a warning voice, tugging at his sleeve, but Harry jerked his arm out of her reach
[13747]904   So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord, did he
[13748]6723  ' Harry asked, his voice shaking
[13749]10445   There was a collective intake of breath from the class, for none of them, apart from Ron and Hermione, had ever heard Harry talk about what had happened on the night Cedric had died
[13750]8603    They stared avidly from Harry to Professor Umbridge, who had raised her eyes and was staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face
[13751]10111   Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident,' she said coldly
[13752]10827   It was murder,' said Harry
[13753]222    He could feel himself shaking
[13754]198    He had hardly spoken to anyone about this, least of all thirty eagerly listening classmates
[13755]1038    Voldemort killed him and you know it
[13756]6814   'Professor Umbridge's face was quite blank
[13757]6900    For a moment, Harry thought she was going to scream at him
[13758]6456    Then she said, in her softest, most sweetly girlish voice, Come here, Mr
[13759]551    Potter, dear
[13760]8793   'He kicked his chair aside, strode around Ron and Hermione and up to the teacher's desk
[13761]555    He could feel the rest of the class holding its breath
[13762]1233    He felt so angry he did not care what happened next
[13763]8069   Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her handbag, stretched it out on the desk, dipped her quill into a bottle of ink and started scribbling, hunched over so that Harry could not see what she was writing
[13764]65    Nobody spoke
[13765]868    After a minute or so she rolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand; it sealed itself seamlessly so that he could not open it
[13766]7649   Take this to Professor McGonagall, dear,' said Professor Umbridge, holding out the note to him
[13767]6342   He took it from her without saying a word, turned on his heel and left the room, not even looking back at Ron and Hermione, slamming the classroom door shut behind him
[13768]2011    He walked very fast along the corridor, the note to McGonagall clutched tight in his hand, and turning a corner walked slap into Peeves the poltergeist, a wide-mouthed little man floating on his back in midair, juggling several inkwells
[13769]5220   Why, it's Potty Wee Potter
[13770]6534  ' cackled Peeves, allowing two of the inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the walls with ink; Harry jumped backwards out of the way with a snarl
[13771]55   Get out of it, Peeves
[13772]15955   'Oooh, Crackpot's feeling cranky,' said Peeves, pursuing Harry along the corridor, leering as he zoomed along above him
[13773]698    What is it this time, my fine Potty friend
[13774]108   Hearing voices
[13775]49   Seeing visions
[13776]126   Speaking in-' Peeves blew a gigantic raspberry - tongues
[13777]5208  'I said, leave me ALONE
[13778]6218  ' Harry shouted, running down the nearest flight of stairs, but Peeves merely slid down the banister on his back beside him
[13779]17117   Oh, most think he's barking, the potty wee lad,But some are more kindly and think he's just sad,But Peevesy knows better and says that he's mad-' SHUT UP
[13780]3074  'A door to his left flew open and Professor McGonagall emerged from her office looking grim and slightly harassed
[13781]529   What on earth are you shouting about, Potter
[13782]247  ' she snapped, as Peeves cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight
[13783]2505    Why aren't you in class
[13784]11599  'I've been sent to see you,' said Harry stiffly
[13785]78   Sent
[13786]309   What do you mean, sent
[13787]1439  'He held out the note from Professor Umbridge
[13788]2208    Professor McGonagall took it from him, frowning, slit it open with a tap of her wand, stretched it out and began to read
[13789]1319    Her eyes zoomed from side to side behind their square spectacles as she read what Umbridge had written, and with each line they became narrower
[13790]897   Come in here, Potter
[13791]345   'He followed her inside her study
[13792]616    The door closed automatically behind him
[13793]0   Well
[13794]6100  ' said Professor McGonagall, rounding on him
[13795]52    Is this true
[13796]52  'Is what true
[13797]6107  ' Harry asked, rather more aggressively than he had intended
[13798]751    Professor
[13799]241  ' he added, in an attempt to sound more polite
[13800]1509   Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge
[13801]11110  'Yes,' said Harry
[13802]129   You called her a liar
[13803]292  'Yes
[13804]345   'You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back
[13805]292  'Yes
[13806]7205   'Professor McGonagall sat down behind her desk, watching Harry closely
[13807]5550    Then she said, Have a biscuit, Potter
[13808]0   'Have-what
[13809]359  'Have a biscuit,' she repeated impatiently, indicating a tartan tin lying on top of one of the piles of papers on her desk
[13810]43    And sit down
[13811]7301   'There had been a previous occasion when Harry, expecting to be caned by Professor McGonagall, had instead been appointed by her to the Gryffindor Quidditch team
[13812]1334    He sank into a chair opposite her and helped himself to a Ginger Newt, feeling just as confused and wrong-footed as he had done on that occasion
[13813]13709   Professor McGonagall set down Professor Umbridge's note and looked very seriously at Harry
[13814]674   Potter, you need to be careful
[13815]5901   'Harry swallowed his mouthful of Ginger Newt and stared at her
[13816]898    Her tone of voice was not at all what he was used to; it was not brisk, crisp and stern; it was low and anxious and somehow much more human than usual
[13817]5808   Misbehaviour in Dolores Umbridge's class could cost you much more than house points and a detention
[13818]0   'What do you-
[13819]1914  'Potter, use your common sense,' snapped Professor McGonagall, with an abrupt return to her usual manner
[13820]1561    You know where she comes from, you must know to whom she is reporting
[13821]380   'The bell rang for the end of the lesson
[13822]437    Overhead and all around came the elephantine sounds of hundreds of students on the move
[13823]17250   It says here she's given you detention every evening this week, starting tomorrow,' Professor McGonagall said, looking down at Umbridge's note again
[13824]137   Every evening this week
[13825]5803  ' Harry repeated, horrified
[13826]3188    But, Professor, couldn't you-
[13827]8537  'No, I couldn't,' said Professor McGonagall flatly
[13828]670   But-'She is your teacher and has every right to give you detention
[13829]646    You will go to her room at five o'clock tomorrow for the first one
[13830]1573    Just remember: tread carefully around Dolores Umbridge
[13831]134   'But I was telling the truth
[13832]10827  ' said Harry, outraged
[13833]7870    Voldemort is back, you know he is; Professor Dumbledore knows he is-'For heaven's sake, Potter
[13834]11331  ' said Professor McGonagall, straightening her glasses angrily (she had winced horribly when he had used Voldemort's name)
[13835]911    Do you really think this is about truth or lies
[13836]5347   It's about keeping your head down and your temper under control
[13837]6306  'She stood up, nostrils wide and mouth very thin, and Harry stood up, too
[13838]5127   Have another biscuit,' she said irritably, thrusting the tin at him
[13839]10890   No, thanks,' said Harry coldly
[13840]3003   Don't be ridiculous,' she snapped
[13841]212   He took one
[13842]5131   Thanks,' he said grudgingly
[13843]8761   Didn't you listen to Dolores Umbridge's speech at the start-of-term feast, Potter
[13844]11095  'Yeah,' said Harry
[13845]277    Yeah 
[13846]0

[13871]6454     Dinner in the Great Hall that night was not a pleasant experience for Harry
[13872]1041    The news about his shouting match with Umbridge had travelled exceptionally fast even by Hogwarts' standards
[13873]4051    He heard whispers all around him as he sat eating between Ron and Hermione
[13874]497    The funny thing was that none of the whisperers seemed to mind him overhearing what they were saying about him
[13875]815    On the contrary, it was as though they were hoping he would get angry and start shouting again, so that they could hear his story first-hand

[13890]0   
[13891]0   
[13892]13982   'The thing is, Harry, I'm not sure they did,' said Hermione grimly
[13893]5432    Oh, let's get out of here
[13894]3136   'She slammed down her own knife and fork; Ron looked longingly at his half-finished apple pie but followed suit

[13906]41   'Which is the truth
[13907]10954  ' said Harry loudly
[13908]7134   I know it is, Harry, so will you please stop biting my head off
[13909]6713  ' said Hermione wearily
[13910]12159    It's just that before the truth could sink in, everyone went home for the summer, where they spent two months reading about how you're a nutcase and Dumbledore's going senile
[13911]375  'Rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empty corridors back to Gryffindor Tower
[13912]6489    Harry felt as though his first day had lasted a week, but he still had a mountain of homework to do before bed
[13913]828    A dull pounding pain was developing over his right eye
[13914]5887    He glanced out of a rain-washed window at the dark grounds as they turned into the Fat Lady's corridor
[13915]5582    There was still no light in Hagrid's cabin
[13916]6879   Mimbulus mimbletonia,' said Hermione, before the Fat Lady could ask
[13917]395    The portrait swung open to reveal the hole behind it and the three of them scrambled through it
[13918]726   The common room was almost empty; nearly everyone was still down at dinner
[13919]17065    Crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them, purring loudly, and when Harry, Ron and Hermione took their three favourite chairs at the fireside he leapt lightly on to Hermione's lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion
[13920]5979    Harry gazed into the flames, feeling drained and exhausted
[13921]1184   How can Dumbledore have let this happen
[13922]10305  ' Hermione cried suddenly, making Harry and Ron jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted
[13923]257    She pounded the arms of her chair in fury, so that bits of stuffing leaked out of the holes
[13924]456    How can he let that terrible woman teach us
[13925]281   And in our OWL year, too
[13926]1449  'Well, we've never had great Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers, have we
[13927]10818  ' said Harry
[13928]12338    You know what it's like, Hagrid told us, nobody wants the job; they say it's jinxed
[13929]5635   'Yes, but to employ someone who's actually refusing to let us do magic
[13930]5606   What's Dumbledore playing at
[13931]12413  'And she's trying to get people to spy for her,' said Ron darkly
[13932]11946   Remember when she said she wanted us to come and tell her if we hear anyone saying You-Know-Who's back
[13933]10545  'Of course she's here to spy on us all, that's obvious, why else would Fudge have wanted her to come
[13934]1666  ' snapped Hermione
[13935]16207   Don't start arguing again,' said Harry wearily, as Ron opened his mouth to retaliate
[13936]3116    Can't we just
[13937]0   
[13938]0   
[13939]6303    let's just do that homework, get it out of the way

[13943]480    People were coming back from dinner now
[13944]6494    Harry kept his face averted from the portrait hole, but could still sense the stares he was attracting
[13945]5300   Shall we do Snape's stuff first

[13962]189   So, what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making
[13963]5464  'But Hermione was not listening; she was squinting over into the far corner of the room, where Fred, George and Lee Jordan were now sitting at the centre of a knot of innocent-looking first-years, all of whom were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag that Fred was holding
[13964]7381   No, I'm sorry, they've gone too far,' she said, standing up and looking positively furious
[13965]2438    Come on, Ron
[13966]0   'I -what
[13967]7693  ' said Ron, plainly playing for time
[13968]4767    No-come on, Hermione-we can't tell them off for giving out sweets
[13969]849   'You know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat or-or Puking Pastilles or-'Fainting Fancies
[13970]5883  ' Harry suggested quietly
[13971]1893   One by one, as though hit over the head with an invisible mallet, the first-years were slumping unconscious in their seats; some slid right on to the floor, others merely hung over the arms of their chairs, their tongues lolling out
[13972]3418    Most of the people watching were laughing; Hermione, however, squared her shoulders and marched directly over to where Fred and George now stood with clipboards, closely observing the unconscious first-years
[13973]14045    Ron rose halfway out of his chair, hovered uncertainly for a moment or two, then muttered to Harry, She's got it under control,' before sinking as low in his chair as his lanky frame permitted
[13974]4750   That's enough
[13975]8243  ' Hermione said forcefully to Fred and George, both of whom looked up in mild surprise
[13976]8849   Yeah, you're right,' said George, nodding, this dosage looks strong enough, doesn't it
[13977]2920  'I told you this morning, you can't test your rubbish on students
[13978]5  'We're paying them
[13979]5531  ' said Fred indignantly
[13980]3065   I don't care, it could be dangerous
[13981]5542  'Rubbish,' said Fred
[13982]1721   Calm down, Hermione, they're fine
[13983]5939  ' said Lee reassuringly as he walked from first-year to first-year, inserting purple sweets into their open mouths
[13984]6429   Yeah, look, they're coming round now,' said George
[13985]175   A few of the first-years were indeed stirring
[13986]8383    Several looked so shocked to find themselves lying on the floor, or dangling off their chairs, that Harry was sure Fred and George had not warned them what the sweets were going to do
[13987]683   Feel all right
[13988]6352  ' said George kindly to a small dark-haired girl lying at his feet
[13989]5656   I-I think so,' she said shakily
[13990]7717   Excellent,' said Fred happily, but the next second Hermione had snatched both his clipboard and the paper bag of Fainting Fancies from his hands
[13991]35   It is NOT excellent
[13992]2621  'Course it is, they're alive, aren't they
[13993]5597  ' said Fred angrily
[13994]2614   You can't do this, what if you made one of them really ill
[13995]6448  'We're not going to make them ill, we've already tested them all on ourselves, this is just to see if everyone reacts the same-'If you don't stop doing it, I'm going to-'Put us in detention
[13996]7494  ' said Fred, in an I'd-like-to-see-you-try-it voice
[13997]260   Make us write lines
[13998]5487  ' said George, smirking
[13999]507   Onlookers all over the room were laughing
[14000]2330    Hermione drew herself up to her full height; her eyes were narrowed and her bushy hair seemed to crackle with electricity
[14001]5799   No,' she said, her voice quivering with anger, but I will write to your mother
[14002]8066   'You wouldn't,' said George, horrified, taking a step back from her
[14003]7384   Oh, yes, I would,' said Hermione grimly
[14004]4326    I can't stop you eating the stupid things yourselves, but you're not to give them to the first-years,'Fred and George looked thunderstruck
[14005]6945    It was clear that as far as they were concerned, Hermione's threat was way below the belt
[14006]5970    With a last threatening look at them, she thrust Fred's clipboard and the bag of Fancies back into his arms, and stalked back to her chair by the fire
[14007]2349   Ron was now so low in his seat that his nose was roughly level with his knees
[14008]8766   Thank you for your support, Ron,' Hermione said acidly
[14009]2103   You handled it fine by yourself,' Ron mumbled
[14010]14857   Hermione stared down at her blank piece of parchment for a few seconds, then said edgily, Oh, it's no good, I can't concentrate now
[14011]1107    I'm going to bed
[14012]7957   ' She wrenched her bag open; Harry thought she was about to put her books away, but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly objects, placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace, covered them with a few screwed-up bits of parchment and a broken quill and stood back to admire the effect
[14013]195   What in the name of Merlin are you doing
[14014]7238  ' said Ron, watching her as though fearful for her sanity
[14015]5536   They're hats for house-elves,' she said briskly now stuffing her books back into her bag
[14016]731    I did them over the summer
[14017]1962    I'm a really slow knitter without magic but now I'm back at school I should be able to make lots more
[14018]330   'You're leaving out hats for the house-elves
[14019]7214  ' said Ron slowly
[14020]42    And you're covering them up with rubbish first
[14021]7093  'Yes,' said Hermione defiantly, swinging her bag on to her back
[14022]11921   That's not on,' said Ron angrily
[14023]294    You're trying to trick them into picking up the hats
[14024]476    You're setting them free when they might not want to be free
[14025]612   ' Of course they want to be free
[14026]7356  ' said Hermione at once, though her face was turning pink
[14027]5030    Don't you dare touch those hats, Ron
[14028]621  'She turned on her heel and left
[14029]2725    Ron waited until she had disappeared through the door to the girls' dormitories, then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats
[14030]5151   They should at least see what they're picking up,' he said firmly
[14031]0    Anyway 
[14032]0   
[14033]0   
[14034]17704   ' he rolled up the parchment on which he had written the title of Snape's essay, there's no point trying to finish this now, I can't do it without Hermione, I haven't got a clue what you're supposed to do with moonstones, have you
[14035]7702  'Harry shook his head, noticing as he did so that the ache in his right temple was getting worse
[14036]958    He thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply
[14037]821    Knowing perfectly well that when the morning came, he would regret not finishing his homework that night, he piled his books back into his bag
[14038]1107   I'm going to bed too
[14039]2216   'He passed Seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormitories, but did not look at him
[14040]6722    Harry had a fleeting impression that Seamus had opened his mouth to speak, but he sped up and reached the soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more provocation
[14041]1043   The following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous one
[14042]951    Hagrid was still absent from the staff table at breakfast
[14043]7643   But on the plus side, no Snape today,' said Ron bracingly
[14044]1655   Hermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee
[14045]8447    She looked mildly pleased about something, and when Ron asked her what she had to be so happy about, she simply said, The hats have gone
[14046]569    Seems the house-elves do want freedom after all
[14047]4787   'I wouldn't bet on it,' Ron told her cuttingly
[14048]38    They might not count as clothes
[14049]4675    They didn't look anything like hats to me, more like woolly bladders
[14050]2459   ' Hermione did not speak to him all morning
[14051]145   Double Charms was succeeded by double Transfiguration
[14052]2222    Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall both spent the first fifteen minutes of their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of OWLs
[14053]7145   What you must remember,' said little Professor Flitwick squeakily, perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top of his desk, is that these examinations may influence your futures for many years to come
[14054]1033   If you have not already given serious thought to your careers, now is the time to do so
[14055]552    And in the meantime, I'm afraid, we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice
[14056]1751  'They then spent over an hour revising Summoning Charms, which according to Professor Flitwick were bound to come up in their OWL, and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest ever amount of Charms homework
[14057]88   It was the same, if not worse, in Transfiguration
[14058]6319   You cannot pass an OWL,' said Professor McGonagall grimly, without serious application, practice and study
[14059]826    I see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an OWL in Transfiguration as long as they put in the work
[14060]682   ' Neville made a sad little disbelieving noise
[14061]6420    Yes, you too, Longbottom,' said Professor McGonagall
[14062]4947    There's nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence
[14063]0    So 
[14064]0   
[14065]0   
[14066]173    today we are starting Vanishing Spells
[14067]560    These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until NEWT level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your OWL
[14068]6617   'She was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly difficult
[14069]10727    By the end of a double period, neither he nor Ron had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practising, though Ron said hopefully he thought his looked a bit paler
[14070]3364    Hermione, on the other hand, successfully vanished her snail on the third attempt, earning her a ten-point bonus for Gryffindor from Professor McGonagall
[14071]910    She was the only person not given homework; everybody else was told to practise the spell overnight, ready for a fresh attempt on their snails the following afternoon
[14072]8938   Now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do, Harry and Ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of moonstones in potion-making
[14073]9179    Still angry about Ron's slur on her woolly hats, Hermione did not join them
[14074]11946    By the time they reached Care of Magical Creatures in the afternoon, Harry's head was aching again
[14075]6407   The day had become cool and breezy, and as they walked down the sloping lawn towards Hagrid's cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, they felt the occasional drop of rain on their faces
[14076]7700    Professor Grubbly-Plank stood waiting for the class some ten yards from Hagrid's front door, a long trestle table in front of her laden with twigs
[14077]9293    As Harry and Ron reached her, a loud shout of laughter sounded behind them; turning, they saw Draco Malfoy striding towards them, surrounded by his usual gang of Slytherin cronies
[14078]13677    He had clearly just said something highly amusing, because Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy Parkinson and the rest continued to snigger heartily as they gathered around the trestle table and, judging by the way they all kept looking over at Harry, he was able to guess the subject of the joke without too much difficulty
[14079]0   Everyone here
[14080]986  ' barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, once all the Slytherins and Gryffindors had arrived
[14081]5105    Let's crack on then
[14082]585    Who can tell me what these things are called
[14083]23  'She indicated the heap of twigs in front of her
[14084]6927    Hermione's hand shot into the air
[14085]1260    Behind her back, Malfoy did a buck-toothed imitation of her jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question
[14086]4727    Pansy Parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once into a scream, as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be what looked like tiny pixie-ish creatures made of wood, each with knobbly brown arms and legs, two twiglike fingers at the end of each hand and a funny flat, barklike face in which a pair of beetle-brown eyes glittered
[14087]1   Oooooh
[14088]10925  ' said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly irritating Harry
[14089]1402    Anyone would have thought Hagrid had never shown them impressive creatures; admittedly, the Flobberworms had been a bit dull, but the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough, and the Blast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too much so
[14090]99   Kindly keep your voices down, girls
[14091]7708  ' said Professor Grubbly-Plank sharply, scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice among the stick-creatures, who immediately fell upon the food
[14092]848    So-anyone know the names of these creatures
[14093]114   Miss Granger
[14094]6706  'Bowtruckles,' said Hermione
[14095]607    They're tree-guardians, usually live in wand-trees
[14096]6160   'Five points for Gryffindor,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank
[14097]1083    Yes, these are Bowtruckles, and as Miss Granger rightly says, they generally live in trees whose wood is of wand quality
[14098]814    Anybody know what they eat
[14099]12674  'Woodlice,' said Hermione promptly, which explained why what Harry had taken to be grains of brown rice were moving
[14100]19    But fairy eggs if they can get them
[14101]454   ' Good girl, take another five points
[14102]442    So, whenever you need leaves or wood from a tree in which a Bowtruckle lodges, it is wise to have a gift of woodlice ready to distract or placate it
[14103]1254    They may not look dangerous, but if angered they will try to gouge at human eyes with their fingers, which, as you can see, are very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs
[14104]1503    So if you'd like to gather closer, take a few woodlice and a Bowtruckle-I have enough here for one between three-you can study them more closely
[14105]699    I want a sketch from each of you with all body-parts labelled by the end of the lesson
[14106]425   'The class surged forwards around the trestle table
[14107]7154    Harry deliberately circled around the back so that he ended up right next to Professor Grubbly-Plank
[14108]5402   Where's Hagrid
[14109]365  ' he asked her, while everyone else was choosing Bowtruckles
[14110]7513   Never you mind,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank repressively, which had been her attitude last time Hagrid had failed to turn up for a class, too
[14111]6976    Smirking all over his pointed face, Draco Malfoy leaned across Harry and seized the largest Bowtruckle
[14112]17349   Maybe,' said Malfoy in an undertone, so that only Harry could hear him, the stupid great oaf's got himself badly injured
[14113]14119   'Maybe you will if you don't shut up,' said Harry out of the side of his mouth
[14114]9714   Maybe he's been messing with stuff that's too big for him, if you get my drift
[14115]7228   'Malfoy walked away, smirking over his shoulder at Harry, who felt suddenly sick
[14116]1878    Did Malfoy know something
[14117]6124   His father was a Death Eater after all; what if he had information about Hagrid's fate that had not yet reached the ears of the Order
[14118]4741   He hurried back around the table to Ron and Hermione who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to persuade a Bowtruckle to remain still long enough for them to draw it
[14119]12471    Harry pulled out parchment and quill, crouched down beside the others and related in a whisper what Malfoy had just said
[14120]9084   Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid,' said Hermione at once
[14121]20525    It's just playing into Malfoy's hands to look worried; it tells him we don't know exactly what's going on
[14122]7135    We've got to ignore him, Harry
[14123]1676    Here, hold the Bowtruckle for a moment, just so I can draw its face 
[14124]0   
[14125]0   
[14126]13535   'Yes,' came Malfoy's clear drawl from the group nearest them, Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you know, and it sounds as though the Ministry's really determined to crack down on sub-standard teaching in this place
[14127]820    So even if that overgrown moron does show up again, he'll probably be sent packing straightaway
[14128]12   'OUCH
[14129]8075  'Harry had gripped the Bowtruckle so hard that it had almost snapped, and it had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with its sharp fingers, leaving two long deep cuts there
[14130]5806    Harry dropped it
[14131]1949    Crabbe and Goyle, who had already been guffawing at the idea of Hagrid being sacked, laughed still harder as the Bowtruckle set off at full tilt towards the Forest, a little moving stick-man soon swallowed up among the tree roots
[14132]18203    When the bell echoed distantly over the grounds, Harry rolled up his blood-stained Bowtruckle picture and marched off to Herbology with his hand wrapped in Hermione's handkerchief, and Malfoy's derisive laughter still ringing in his ears
[14133]1214   If he calls Hagrid a moron one more time 
[14134]0   
[14135]0   
[14136]10878   ' said Harry through gritted teeth
[14137]17288   Harry, don't go picking a row with Malfoy, don't forget, he's a prefect now, he could make life difficult for you 
[14138]0   
[14139]0   
[14140]1523   'Wow, I wonder what it'd be like to have a difficult life
[14141]10824  ' said Harry sarcastically
[14142]3676    Ron laughed, but Hermione frowned
[14143]40    Together, they traipsed across the vegetable patch
[14144]734    The sky still appeared unable to make up its mind whether it wanted to rain or not
[14145]17881   I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back, that's all,' said Harry in a low voice, as they reached the greenhouses
[14146]8355    And don't say that Grubbly-Plank woman's a better teacher
[14147]101  ' he added threateningly
[14148]9670   I wasn't going to,' said Hermione calmly
[14149]13626   Because she'll never be as good as Hagrid,' said Harry firmly, fully aware that he had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical Creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it
[14150]1265   The door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some fourth-years spilled out of it, including Ginny
[14151]5266   Hi,' she said brightly as she passed
[14152]1498    A few seconds later, Luna Lovegood emerged, trailing behind the rest of the class, a smudge of earth on her nose, and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head
[14153]6672    When she saw Harry, her prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly and she made a beeline straight for him
[14154]432    Many of his classmates turned curiously to watch
[14155]6094    Luna took a great breath and then said, without so much as a preliminary hello, I believe He Who Must Not Be Named is back and I believe you fought him and escaped from him
[14156]11505   ' Er-right,' said Harry awkwardly
[14157]2052    Luna was wearing what looked like a pair of orange radishes for earrings, a fact that Parvati and Lavender seemed to have noticed, as they were both giggling and pointing at her earlobes
[14158]11873   You can laugh,' Luna said, her voice rising, apparently under the impression that Parvati and Lavender were laughing at what she had said rather than what she was wearing, but people used to believe there were no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack
[14159]2912  'Well, they were right, weren't they
[14160]6746  ' said Hermione impatiently
[14161]2512    There weren't any such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack
[14162]1213   'Luna gave her a withering look and flounced away, radishes swinging madly
[14163]171    Parvati and Lavender were not the only ones hooting with laughter now
[14164]1187   D'you mind not offending the only people who believe me
[14165]8202  ' Harry asked Hermione as they made their way into class
[14166]17750   Oh, for heaven's sake, Harry, you can do better than her,' said Hermione
[14167]11385    Ginny's told me all about her; apparently, she'll only believe in things as long as there's no proof at all
[14168]2606    Well, I wouldn't expect anything else from someone whose father runs The Quibbler
[14169]11828   'Harry thought of the sinister winged horses he had seen on the night he had arrived and how Luna had said she could see them too
[14170]218    His spirits sank slightly
[14171]83    Had she been lying
[14172]621   But before he could devote much more thought to the matter, Ernie Macmillan had stepped up to him
[14173]12111   I want you to know, Potter,' he said in a loud, carrying voice, that it's not only weirdos who support you
[14174]116    I personally believe you one hundred per cent
[14175]1060    My family have always stood firm behind Dumbledore, and so do I
[14176]11195   'Er-thanks very much, Ernie,' said Harry, taken aback but pleased
[14177]7448    Ernie might be pompous on occasions like this, but Harry was in a mood to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from somebody who did not have radishes dangling from their ears
[14178]21123    Ernie's words had certainly wiped the smile from Lavender Browns face and as he turned to talk to Ron and Hermione, Harry caught Seamus's expression, which looked both confused and defiant
[14179]5836   To nobody's surprise, Professor Sprout started their lesson by lecturing them about the importance of OWLs
[14180]8706    Harry wished all the teachers would stop doing this; he was starting to get an anxious, twisted feeling in his stomach every time he remembered how much homework he had to do, a feeling that worsened dramatically when Professor Sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class
[14181]2015    Tired and smelling strongly of dragon dung, Professor Sprouts preferred type of fertiliser, the Gryffindors trooped back up to the castle an hour and a half later, none of them talking very much; it had been another long day
[14182]7088   As Harry was starving, and he had his first detention with Umbridge at five o'clock, he headed straight for dinner without dropping off his bag in Gryffindor Tower so that he could bolt something down before facing whatever she had in store for him
[14183]1963    He had barely reached the entrance of the Great Hall, however, when a loud and angry voice yelled, Oi, Potter
[14184]0  'What now
[14185]1557  ' he muttered wearily, turning to face Angelina Johnson, who looked as though she was in a towering temper
[14186]6364   I'll tell you what now,' she said, marching straight up to him and poking him hard in the chest with her finger
[14187]1383    How come you've landed yourself in detention for five o'clock on Friday
[14188]0  'What
[14189]10818  ' said Harry
[14190]0    Why 
[14191]0   
[14192]0   
[14193]668    oh yeah, Keeper tryouts
[14194]2  'Now he remembers
[14195]124  ' snarled Angelina
[14196]3315    Didn't I tell you I wanted to do a tryout with the whole team, and find someone who fitted in with everyone
[14197]3876  Didn't I tell you I'd booked the Quidditch pitch specially
[14198]1220   And now you've decided you're not going to be there
[14199]2730  'I didn't decide not to be there
[14200]10937  ' said Harry, stung by the injustice of these words
[14201]3308    I got detention from that Umbridge woman, just because I told her the truth about You-Know-Who
[14202]9561   'Well, you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off en Friday,' said Angelina fiercely, and I don't care how you do it
[14203]7831    Tell her You-Know-Who's a figment of your imagination if you like, just make sure you're there
[14204]694  'She turned on her heel and stormed away
[14205]771   You know what
[14206]0   
[14207]14971  ' Harry said to Ron and Hermione as they entered the Great Hall
[14208]6389    I think we'd better check with Puddlemere United whether Oliver Wood's been killed during a training session, because Angelina seems to be channelling his spirit
[14209]1275   'What d'you reckon are the odds of Umbridge letting you off on Friday
[14210]7625  ' said Ron sceptically, as they sat down at the Gryffindor table
[14211]10935   Less than zero,' said Harry glumly, tipping lamb chops on to his plate and starting to eat
[14212]2677    Better try, though, hadn't I
[14213]635   I'll offer to do two more detentions or something, I dunno 
[14214]0   
[14215]0   
[14216]3046   ' He swallowed a mouthful of potato and added, I hope she doesn't keep me too long this evening
[14217]2430    You realise we've got to write three essays, practise Vanishing Spells for McGonagall, work out a counter-charm for Flitwick, finish the Bowtruckle drawing and start that stupid dream diary for Trelawney
[14218]2188  'Ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling
[14219]6098   And it looks like it's going to rain
[14220]5510   'What's that got to do with our homework
[14221]6868  ' said Hermione, her eyebrows raised
[14222]7181   Nothing,' said Ron at once, his ears reddening
[14223]11638   At five to five Harry bade the other two goodbye and set off for Umbridge's office on the third floor
[14224]1634    When he knocked on the door she called, Come in,' in a sugary voice
[14225]695    He entered cautiously, looking around
[14226]238   He had known this office under three of its previous occupants
[14227]413   In the days when Gilderoy Lockhart had lived here it had been plastered in beaming portraits of himself
[14228]853    When Lupin had occupied it, it was likely you would meet some fascinating Dark creature in a cage or tank if you came to call
[14229]4986    In the impostor Moody's days it had been packed with various instruments and artefacts for the detection of wrongdoing and concealment
[14230]681   Now, however, it looked totally unrecognisable
[14231]18    The surfaces had all been draped in lacy covers and cloths
[14232]534    There were several vases full of dried flowers, each one residing on its own doily, and on one of the walls was a collection of ornamental plates, each decorated with a large technicolour kitten wearing a different bow around its neck
[14233]7269    These were so foul that Harry stared at them, transfixed, until Professor Umbridge spoke again
[14234]1258   Good evening, Mr Potter
[14235]6525   'Harry started and looked around
[14236]575    He had not noticed her at first because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her
[14237]12232   Evening, Professor Umbridge,' Harry said stiffly
[14238]5841   Well, sit down,' she said, pointing towards a small table draped in lace beside which she had drawn up a straight-backed chair
[14239]618    A piece of blank parchment lay on the table, apparently waiting for him
[14240]11035   Er,' said Harry, without moving
[14241]1322    Professor Umbridge
[14242]479    Er-before we start, I-I wanted to ask you a 
[14243]0   
[14244]0   
[14245]6    a favour
[14246]509   'Her bulging eyes narrowed
[14247]654   Oh, yes
[14248]441  'Well, I'm 
[14249]0   
[14250]0   
[14251]872    I'm in the Gryffindor Quidditch team
[14252]906    And I was supposed to be at the tryouts for the new Keeper at five o'clock on Friday and I was-was wondering whether I could skip detention that night and do it-do it another night 
[14253]0   
[14254]0   
[14255]70    instead 
[14256]0   
[14257]0   
[14258]1339   'He knew long before he reached the end of his sentence that it was no good
[14259]7688   Oh, no,' said Umbridge, smiling so widely that she looked as though she had just swallowed a particularly juicy fly
[14260]362    Oh, no, no, no
[14261]504    This is your punishment for spreading evil, nasty, attention-seeking stories, Mr
[14262]5294    Potter, and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the guilty one's convenience
[14263]834    No, you will come here at five o'clock tomorrow, and the next day, and on Friday too, and you will do your detentions as planned
[14264]1731    I think it rather a good thing that you are missing something you really want to do
[14265]397    It ought to reinforce the lesson I am trying to teach you
[14266]7052   'Harry felt the blood surge to his head and heard a thumping noise in his ears
[14267]1093    So he told evil, nasty, attention-seeking stones', did he
[14268]1536  She was watching him with her head slightly to one side, still smiling widely, as though she knew exactly what he was thinking and was waiting to see whether he would start shouting again
[14269]7247    With a massive effort, Harry looked away from her, dropped his schoolbag beside the straight-backed chair and sat down
[14270]8364   There,' said Umbridge sweetly, we're getting better at controlling our temper already, aren't we
[14271]1525   Now, you are going to be doing some lines for me, Mr Potter
[14272]6253    No, not with your quill,' she added, as Harry bent down to open his bag
[14273]541    You're going to be using a rather special one of mine
[14274]0    Here you are
[14275]811   'She handed him a long, thin black quill with an unusually sharp point
[14276]1090   I want you to write, I must not tell lies,' she told him softly
[14277]69   How many times
[14278]6097  ' Harry asked, with a creditable imitation of politeness
[14279]6447   Oh, as long as it takes for the message to sink in,' said Umbridge sweetly
[14280]0    Off you go
[14281]1940   'She moved over to her desk, sat down and bent over a stack of parchment that looked like essays for marking
[14282]6252    Harry raised the sharp black quill, then realised what was missing
[14283]7645   You haven't given me any ink,' he said
[14284]10039   Oh, you won't need ink,' said Professor Umbridge, with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her voice
[14285]6335   Harry placed the point of the quill on the paper and wrote: I must not tell lies
[14286]404   He let out a gasp of pain
[14287]579    The words had appeared on the parchment in what appeared to be shining red ink
[14288]13077    At the same time, the words had appeared on the back of Harry's right hand, cut into his skin as though traced there by a scalpel - yet even as he stared at the shining cut, the skin healed over again, leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but quite smooth
[14289]7104   Harry looked round at Umbridge
[14290]536    She was watching him, her wide, toadlike mouth stretched in a smile
[14291]292   Yes
[14292]10955  'Nothing,' said Harry quietly
[14293]3085   He looked back at the parchment, placed the quill on it once more, wrote I must not tell lies, and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a second time; once again, the words had been cut into his skin; once again, they healed over seconds later
[14294]198   And on it went
[14295]6444    Again and again Harry wrote the words on the parchment in what he soon came to realise was not ink, but his own blood
[14296]1401    And, again and again, the words were cut into the back of his hand, healed, and reappeared the next time he set quill to parchment
[14297]5802   Darkness fell outside Umbridge's window
[14298]6688    Harry did not ask when he would be allowed to stop
[14299]783    He did not even check his watch
[14300]1852    He knew she was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any, not even if he had to sit there all night, cutting open his own hand with this quill 
[14301]0   
[14302]0   
[14303]5571   Come here,' she said, after what seemed hours
[14304]156   He stood up
[14305]375    His hand was stinging painfully
[14306]1179    When he looked down at it he saw that the cut had healed, but that the skin there was red raw
[14307]5442   Hand,' she said
[14308]5   He extended it
[14309]212    She took it in her own
[14310]6161    Harry repressed a shudder as she touched him with her thick, stubby fingers on which she wore a number of ugly old rings
[14311]8135   Tut, tut, I don't seem to have made much of an impression yet,' she said, smiling
[14312]4028    Well, we'll just have to try again tomorrow evening, won't we
[14313]0   You may go
[14314]6256   'Harry left her office without a word
[14315]643    The school was quite deserted; it was surely past midnight
[14316]1362    He walked slowly up the corridor, then, when he had turned the corner and was sure she would not hear him, broke into a run
[14317]1068   He had not had time to practise Vanishing Spells, had not written a single dream in his dream diary and had not finished the drawing of the Bowtruckle, nor had he written his essays
[14318]2448    He skipped breakfast next morning to scribble down a couple of made-up dreams for Divination, their first lesson, and was surprised to find a dishevelled Ron keeping him company
[14319]3334   How come you didn't do it last night
[14320]8787  ' Harry asked, as Ron stared wildly around the common room for inspiration
[14321]9302    Ron, who had been fast asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory, muttered something about doing other stuff, bent low over his parchment and scrawled a few words
[14322]5844   That'll have to do,' he said, slamming the diary shut
[14323]8545    I've said I dreamed I was buying a new pair of shoes, she can't make anything weird out of that, can she
[14324]124  'They hurried off to North Tower together
[14325]615   How was detention with Umbridge, anyway
[14326]871   What did she make you do
[14327]11031  'Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, then said, Lines
[14328]4870   'That's not too bad, then, eh
[14329]7088  ' said Ron
[14330]10822   Nope,' said Harry
[14331]1048   Hey-I forgot- did she let you off for Friday
[14332]10818  'No,' said Harry
[14333]2025   Ron groaned sympathetically
[14334]6231   It was another bad day for Harry; he was one of the worst in Transfiguration, not having practised Vanishing Spells at all
[14335]1708    He had to give up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the Bowtruckle and, meanwhile, Professors McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank and Sinistra gave them yet more homework, which he had no prospect of finishing that evening because of his second detention with Umbridge
[14336]5671    To cap it all, Angelina Johnson tracked him down at dinner again and, on learning that he would not be able to attend Friday's Keeper tryouts, told him she was not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected players who wished to remain on the team to put training before their other commitments
[14337]485   I'm in detention
[14338]6161  ' Harry yelled after her as she stalked away
[14339]2676    D'you think I'd rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing Quidditch
[14340]18050  'At least it's only lines,' said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank back on to his bench and looked down at his steak and kidney pie, which he no longer fancied very much
[14341]9820    It's not as it it's a dreadful punishment, really 
[14342]0   
[14343]0   
[14344]6244   'Harry opened his mouth, closed it again and nodded
[14345]12535    He was not really sure why he was not telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was happening in Umbridge's room: he only knew that he did not want to see their looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face
[14346]1465    He also felt dimly that this was between himself and Umbridge, a private battle of wills, and he was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it
[14347]10975   I can't believe how much homework we've got,' said Ron miserably
[14348]2898   Well, why didn't you do any last night
[14349]1971  ' Hermione asked him
[14350]0    Where were you, anyway
[14351]0  'I was 
[14352]0   
[14353]0   
[14354]7149    I fancied a walk,' said Ron shiftily
[14355]6166   Harry had the distinct impression that he was not alone in concealing things at the moment
[14356]1126   The second detention was just as bad as the previous one
[14357]11195    The skin on the back of Harry's hand became irritated more quickly now and was soon red and inflamed
[14358]6489    Harry thought it unlikely that it would keep healing as effectively for long
[14359]1091    Soon the cut would remain etched into his hand and Umbridge would, perhaps, be satisfied
[14360]7104    He let no gasp of pain escape him, however, and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his dismissal, again past midnight, he said nothing but good evening' and goodnight'
[14361]7394   His homework situation, however, was now desperate, and when he returned to the Gryffindor common room he did not, though exhausted, go to bed, but opened his books and began Snape's moonstone essay
[14362]955    It was half past two by the time he had finished it
[14363]1060    He knew he had done a poor job, but there was no help for it; unless he had something to give in he would be in detention with Snape next
[14364]2646    He then dashed off answers to the questions Professor McGonagall had set them, cobbled together something on the proper handling of Bowtruckles for Professor Grubbly-Plank, and staggered up to bed, where he fell fully clothed on top of the covers and fell asleep immediately
[14365]132   Thursday passed in a haze of tiredness
[14366]7742    Ron seemed very sleepy too, though Harry could not see why he should be
[14367]23191    Harry's third detention passed in the same way as the previous two, except that after two hours the words I must not tell lies' did not fade from the back of Harry's hand, but remained scratched there, oozing droplets of blood
[14368]1921    The pause in the pointed quills scratching made Professor Umbridge look up
[14369]5783   Ah,' she said softly, moving around her desk to examine his hand herself
[14370]343    Good
[14371]2382    That ought to serve as a reminder to you, oughtn't it
[14372]166   You may leave for tonight
[14373]477   'Do I still have to come back tomorrow
[14374]12038  ' said Harry, picking up his schoolbag with his left hand rather than his smarting right one
[14375]7146   Oh yes,' said Professor Umbridge, smiling as widely as before
[14376]1294    Yes, I think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evenings work
[14377]6804   'Harry had never before considered the possibility that there might be another teacher in the world he hated more than Snape, but as he walked back towards Gryffindor Tower he had to admit he had found a strong contender
[14378]12587    She's evil, he thought, as he climbed a staircase to the seventh floor, she's an evil, twisted, mad old-Ron
[14379]3356  'He had reached the top of the stairs, turned right and almost walked into Ron, who was lurking behind a statue of Lachlan the Lanky, clutching his broomstick
[14380]6782    He gave a great leap of surprise when he saw Harry and attempted to hide his new Cleansweep Eleven behind his back
[14381]182   What are you doing
[14382]121  'Er-nothing
[14383]182    What are you doing
[14384]5739  'Harry frowned at him
[14385]768   Come on, you can tell me
[14386]34   What are you hiding here for
[14387]9581  'I'm-I'm hiding from Fred and George, if you must know,' said Ron
[14388]6149    They just went past with a bunch of first-years, I bet they're testing stuff on them again, I mean, they can't do it in the common room now, can they, not with Hermione there
[14389]581   'He was talking in a very fast, feverish way
[14390]3256   But what have you got your broom for, you haven't been flying, have you
[14391]6088  ' Harry asked
[14392]4532   I-well-well, OK, I'll tell you, but don't laugh, all right
[14393]7346  ' Ron said defensively, turning redder with every second
[14394]2768    I-I thought I'd try out for Gryffindor Keeper now I've got a decent broom
[14395]0    There
[14396]0    Go on
[14397]53    Laugh
[14398]11315   'I'm not laughing,' said Harry
[14399]2016    Ron blinked
[14400]4887    It's a brilliant idea
[14401]1730   It'd be really cool if you got on the team
[14402]1265   I've never seen you play Keeper, are you good
[14403]18815  'I'm not bad,' said Ron, who looked immensely relieved at Harry's reaction
[14404]875    Charlie, Fred and George always made me keep for them when they were training during the holidays
[14405]751   'So you've been practising tonight
[14406]89  'Every evening since Tuesday 
[14407]0   
[14408]0   
[14409]808    just on my own, though
[14410]7739    I've been trying to bewitch Quaffles to fly at me, but it hasn't been easy and I don't know how much use it'll be
[14411]2743   ' Ron looked nervous and anxious
[14412]1496    Fred and George are going to laugh themselves stupid when I turn up for the tryouts
[14413]3439    They haven't stopped taking the mickey out of me since I got made a prefect
[14414]12052   'I wish I was going to be there,' said Harry bitterly, as they set off together towards the common room
[14415]11115   Yeah, so do- Harry, what's that on the back of your hand
[14416]9800  'Harry, who had just scratched his nose with his free right hand, tried to hide it, but had as much success as Ron with his Cleansweep
[14417]39142   It's just a cut -it's nothing-it's-'But Ron had grabbed Harry's forearm and pulled the back of Harry's hand up level with his eyes
[14418]6684    There was a pause, during which he stared at the words carved into the skin, then, looking sick, he released Harry
[14419]6373   I thought you said she was just giving you lines
[14420]15682  'Harry hesitated, but after all, Ron had been honest with him, so he told Ron the truth about the hours he had been spending in Umbridge's office
[14421]195   The old hag
[14422]7937  ' Ron said in a revolted whisper as they came to a halt in front of the Fat Lady, who was dozing peacefully with her head against her frame
[14423]4786    She's sick
[14424]525   Go to McGonagall, say something
[14425]10818  'No,' said Harry at once
[14426]5996    I'm not giving her the satisfaction of knowing she's got to me
[14427]690   'Got to you
[14428]2972  You can't let her get away with this
[14429]20268  'I don't know how much power McGonagall's got over her,' said Harry
[14430]1966   Dumbledore, then, tell Dumbledore
[14431]10826  'No,' said Harry flatly
[14432]0   Why not
[14433]16504  'He's got enough on his mind,' said Harry, but that was not the true reason
[14434]2295    He was not going to go to Dumbledore for help when Dumbledore had not spoken to him once since June
[14435]3386   Well, I reckon you should-' Ron began, but he was interrupted by the Fat Lady, who had been watching them sleepily and now burst out, Are you going to give me the password or will I have to stay awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation
[14436]191  'Friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week
[14437]8685    Though Harry automatically glanced towards the staff table when he entered the Great Hall, it was without any real hope of seeing Hagrid, and he turned his mind immediately to his more pressing problems, such as the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with Umbridge
[14438]6030   Two things sustained Harry that day
[14439]8631    One was the thought that it was almost the weekend; the other was that, dreadful though his final detention with Umbridge was sure to be, he had a distant view of the Quidditch pitch from her window and might, with luck, be able to see something of Ron's tryout
[14440]6429    These were rather feeble rays of light, it was true, but Harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his present darkness; he had never had a worse first week of term at Hogwarts
[14441]7961   At five o'clock that evening he knocked on Professor Umbridge's office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time, and was told to enter
[14442]974    The blank parchment lay ready for him on the lace-covered table, the pointed black quill beside it
[14443]1143   You know what to do, Mr
[14444]6199    Potter,' said Umbridge, smiling sweetly at him
[14445]6043   Harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window
[14446]1516    If he just shifted his chair an inch or so to the right 
[14447]0   
[14448]0   
[14449]321    on the pretext of shifting himself closer to the table, he managed it
[14450]1514    He now had a distant view of the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch, while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high goalposts, apparently awaiting their turn to Keep
[14451]2370    It was impossible to tell which one was Ron at this distance
[14452]6107   I must not tell lies,Harry wrote
[14453]1250    The cut in the back of his right hand opened and began to bleed afresh
[14454]352   I must not tell lies
[14455]65   The cut dug deeper, stinging and smarting
[14456]352   I must not tell lies
[14457]114   Blood trickled down his wrist
[14458]191   He chanced another glance out of the window
[14459]265    Whoever was defending the goalposts now was doing a very poor job indeed
[14460]6013    Katie Bell scored twice in the few seconds Harry dared to watch
[14461]5300    Hoping very much that the Keeper wasn't Ron, he dropped his eyes back to the parchment shining with blood
[14462]352   I must not tell lies
[14463]352   I must not tell lies
[14464]6831   He looked up whenever he thought he could risk it; when he could hear the scratching of Umbridge's quill or the opening of a desk drawer
[14465]766    The third person to try out was pretty good, the fourth was terrible, the fifth dodged a Bludger exceptionally well but then fumbled an easy save
[14466]6256    The sky was darkening, and Harry doubted he would be able to see the sixth and seventh people at all
[14467]352   I must not tell lies
[14468]352   I must not tell lies
[14469]664   The parchment was now dotted with drops of blood from the back of his hand, which was searing with pain
[14470]1176    When he next looked up, night had fallen and the Quidditch pitch was no longer visible
[14471]6484   Let's see if you've got the message yet, shall we
[14472]11353  ' said Umbridge's soft voice half an hour later
[14473]336   She moved towards him, stretching out her short ringed fingers for his arm
[14474]1023    And then, as she took hold of him to examine the words now cut into his skin, pain seared, not across the back of his hand, but across the scar on his forehead
[14475]581    At the same time, he had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around his midriff
[14476]624   He wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet, staring at her
[14477]1053    She looked back at him, a smile stretching her wide, slack mouth
[14478]2712   Yes, it hurts, doesn't it
[14479]5132  ' she said softly
[14480]740   He did not answer
[14481]356    His heart was thumping very hard and fast
[14482]3068    Was she talking about his hand or did she know what he had just felt in his forehead
[14483]1712   Well, I think I've made my point, Mr
[14484]461    Potter
[14485]0    You may go
[14486]983   'He caught up his schoolbag and left the room as quickly as he could
[14487]519   Stay calm, he told himself, as he sprinted up the stairs
[14488]3359    Stay calm, it doesn't necessarily mean what you think it means 
[14489]0   
[14490]0   
[14491]14   Mimbulus mimbletonia
[14492]199  ' he gasped at the Fat Lady, who swung forwards once more
[14493]131   A roar of sound greeted him
[14494]2922    Ron came running towards him, beaming all over his face and slopping Butterbeer down his front from the goblet he was clutching
[14495]7303   Harry, I did it, I'm in, I'm Keeper
[14496]0  'What
[14497]388   Oh- brilliant
[14498]11711  ' said Harry, trying to smile naturally, while his heart continued to race and his hand throbbed and bled
[14499]23   Have a Butterbeer
[14500]2060   ' Ron pressed a bottle on him
[14501]8903    I can't believe it-where's Hermione gone
[14502]10392  'She's there,' said Fred, who was also swigging Butterbeer, and pointed to an armchair by the fire
[14503]2013    Hermione was dozing in it, her drink tipping precariously in her hand
[14504]13324   Well, she said she was pleased when I told her,' said Ron, looking slightly put out
[14505]5865   Let her sleep,' said George hastily
[14506]6068    It was a few moments before Harry noticed that several of the first-years gathered around them bore unmistakeable signs of recent nosebleeds
[14507]7821   Come here, Ron, and see if Oliver's old robes fit you,' called Kade Bell, we can take off his name and put yours on instead 
[14508]0   
[14509]0   
[14510]8483   'As Ron moved away, Angelina came striding up to Harry
[14511]5939   Sorry I was a bit short with you earlier, Potter,' she said abruptly
[14512]6999    It's stressful this managing lark, you know, I'm starting to think I was a bit hard on Wood sometimes
[14513]2708   ' She was watching Ron over the rim of her goblet with a slight frown on her face
[14514]15935   Look, I know he's your best mate, but he's not fabulous,' she said bluntly
[14515]1904    I think with a bit of training he'll be all right, though
[14516]591    He comes from a family of good Quidditch players
[14517]828    I'm banking on him turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today, to be honest
[14518]14688    Vicky Frobisher and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better this evening, but Hooper's a real whiner, he's always moaning about something or other, and Vicky's involved in all sorts of societies
[14519]748    She admitted herself that if training clashed with her Charms Club she'd put Charms first
[14520]2144    Anyway, we're having a practice session at two o'clock tomorrow, so just make sure you're there this time
[14521]2235    And do me a favour and help Ron as much as you can, OK
[14522]197  'He nodded, and Angelina strolled back to Alicia Spinnet
[14523]7563    Harry moved over to sit next to Hermione, who awoke with a jerk as he put down his bag
[14524]10844   Oh, Harry, it's you 
[14525]0   
[14526]0   
[14527]4754    good about Ron, isn't it
[14528]5091  ' she said blearily
[14529]1280    I'm just so-so-so tired,' she yawned
[14530]298    I was up until one o'clock making more hats
[14531]826    They're disappearing like mad
[14532]7513  'And sure enough, now that he looked, Harry saw that there were woolly hats concealed all around the room where unwary elves might accidentally pick them up
[14533]12283   Great,' said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell somebody soon, he would burst
[14534]8117    Listen, Hermione, I was just up in Umbridge's office and she touched my arm 
[14535]0   
[14536]0   
[14537]1689   'Hermione listened closely
[14538]17327    When Harry had finished, she said slowly, You're worried You-Know-Who's controlling her like he controlled Quirrell
[14539]18550  'Well,' said Harry, dropping his voice, it's a possibility, isn't it
[14540]6824  'I suppose so,' said Hermione, though she sounded unconvinced
[14541]24208    But I don't think he can be possessing her the way he possessed Quirrell, I mean, he's properly alive again now, isn't he, he's got his own body, he wouldn't need to share someone else's
[14542]115    He could have her under the Imperius Curse, I suppose 
[14543]0   
[14544]0   
[14545]6983   'Harry watched Fred, George and Lee Jordan juggling empty Butterbeer bottles for a moment
[14546]12329    Then Hermione said, But last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didn't Dumbledore say it had to do with what You-Know-Who was feeling at the time
[14547]9708   I mean, maybe this hasn't got anything to do with Umbridge at all, maybe it's just coincidence it happened while you were with her
[14548]15592  'She's evil,' said Harry flatly
[14549]20    Twisted
[14550]5096   'She's horrible, yes, but 
[14551]0   
[14552]0   
[14553]7656    Harry, I think you ought to tell Dumbledore your scar hurt
[14554]6187   'It was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to Dumbledore and his answer to Hermione was just the same as his answer to Ron
[14555]450   I'm not bothering him with this
[14556]11476    Like you just said, it's not a big deal
[14557]37731    It's been hurting on and off all summer-it was just a bit worse tonight, that's all-'Harry, I'm sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by this-' Yeah,' said Harry, before he could stop himself, that's the only bit of me Dumbledore cares about, isn't it, my scar
[14558]8013  'Don't say that, it's not true
[14559]11056  'I think I'll write and tell Sirius about it, see what he thinks-'Harry, you can't put something like that in a letter
[14560]7324  ' said Hermione, looking alarmed
[14561]3546    Don't you remember, Moody told us to be careful what we put in writing
[14562]5547   We just can't guarantee owls aren't being intercepted any more
[14563]3890  ' All right, all right, I won't tell him, then
[14564]10841  ' said Harry irritably
[14565]934    He got to his feet
[14566]1107    I'm going to bed
[14567]2334    Tell Ron for me, will you
[14568]8232  'Oh no,' said Hermione, looking relieved, if you're going that means I can go too, without being rude
[14569]1089    I'm absolutely exhausted and I want to make some more hats tomorrow
[14570]6793    Listen, you can help me if you like, it's quite fun, I'm getting better, I can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now
[14571]7594   'Harry looked into her face, which was shining with glee, and tried to look as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer
[14572]121   Er 
[14573]0   
[14574]0   
[14575]8629    no, I don't think I will, thanks,' he said

[14596]832    Lionfish 11/Nov/2007     Chapter Fourteen     Percy and PadfootContents  Prev Chapter  Next Chapter  
[14597]5916     Harry was first to wake up in his dormitory next morning
[14598]5826    He lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the ray of sunlight coming through the gap in his four-poster's hangings, and savoured the thought that it was Saturday
[14599]1165    The first week of term seemed to have dragged on for ever, like one gigantic History of Magic lesson
[14600]1398   Judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that beam of sunlight, it was just after daybreak
[14601]1440    He pulled open the curtains around his bed, got up and started to dress
[14602]370    The only sound apart from the distant twittering of birds was the slow, deep breathing of his fellow Gryffindors
[14603]1219    He opened his schoolbag carefully, pulled out parchment and quill and headed out of the dormitory for the common room
[14604]7367   Making straight for his favourite squashy old armchair beside the now extinct fire, Harry settled himself down comfortably and unrolled his parchment while looking around the room
[14605]8016    The detritus of crumpled-up bits of parchment, old Gobstones, empty ingredient jars and sweet wrappers that usually covered the common room at the end of each day was gone, as were all Hermione's elf hats
[14606]6851    Wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they wanted to be or not, Harry uncorked his ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his parchment, thinking hard 
[14607]0   
[14608]0   
[14609]523    but after a minute or so he found himself staring into the empty grate, at a complete loss for what to say
[14610]3929   He could now appreciate how hard it had been for Ron and Hermione to write him letters over the summer
[14611]2904    How was he supposed to tell Sirius everything that had happened over the past week and pose all the questions he was burning to ask without giving potential letter-thieves a lot of information he did not want them to have
[14612]991  He sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the fireplace, then, finally coming to a decision, he dipped his quill into the ink bottle once more and set it resolutely on the parchment
[14613]10611   Dear Snuffles,Hope you're OK, the first week back here's been terrible, I'm really glad it's the weekend
[14614]3358   We've got a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Umbridge
[14615]5004    She's nearly as nice as your mum
[14616]1891    I'm writing because that thing I wrote to you about last summer happened again last night when I was doing a detention with Umbridge
[14617]790   We're all missing our biggest friend, we hope he'll be back soon
[14618]190   Please write back quickly
[14619]615   Best,HarryHarry reread the letter several times, trying to see it from the point of view of an outsider
[14620]2010    He could not see how they would know what he was talking about-or who he was talking to-just from reading this letter
[14621]2392    He did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about Hagrid and tell them when he might be back
[14622]7897    Harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what Hagrid might be up to while he was not at Hogwarts
[14623]2050   Considering it was a very short letter, it had taken a long time to write; sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been working on it and he could now hear distant sounds of movement from the dormitories above
[14624]338    Sealing the parchment carefully, he climbed through the portrait hole and headed off for the Owlery
[14625]12615   I would not go that way if I were you,' said Nearly Headless Nick, drifting disconcertingly through a wall just ahead of Harry as he walked down the passage
[14626]404    Peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next person to pass the bust of Paracelsus halfway down the corridor
[14627]5444   'Does it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the person's head
[14628]6088  ' asked Harry
[14629]5994   Funnily enough, it does,' said Nearly Headless Nick in a bored voice
[14630]4913    Subtlety has never been Peeves's strong point
[14631]536    I'm off to try and find the Bloody Baron 
[14632]0   
[14633]0   
[14634]259    he might be able to put a stop to it 
[14635]0   
[14636]0   
[14637]5732    see you, Harry 
[14638]0   
[14639]0   
[14640]12632   ' Yeah, bye,' said Harry and instead of turning right, he turned left, taking a longer but safer route up to the Owlery
[14641]1173    His spirits rose as he walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky; he had training later, he would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last
[14642]17   Something brushed his ankles
[14643]6395    He looked down and saw the caretaker's skeletal grey cat, Mrs Norris, slinking past him
[14644]1122    She turned lamplike yellow eyes on him for a moment before disappearing behind a statue of Wilfred the Wistful
[14645]6552   I'm not doing anything wrong,' Harry called after her
[14646]6179    She had the unmistakeable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss, yet Harry could not see why; he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the Owlery on a Saturday morning
[14647]8672   The sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the Owlery the glassless windows dazzled his eyes; thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on rafters, a little restless in the early-morning light, some clearly just returned from hunting
[14648]1065    The straw-covered floor crunched a little as he stepped across tiny animal bones, craning his neck for a sight of Hedwig
[14649]5214   There you are,' he said, spotting her somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling
[14650]1471    Get down here, I've got a letter for you
[14651]635   'With a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared down on to his shoulder
[14652]7683   Right, I know this says Snuffles on the outside,' he told her, giving her the letter to clasp in her beak and, without knowing exactly why, whispering, but it's for Sirius, OK
[14653]967  'She blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she understood
[14654]11489   Safe flight, then,' said Harry and he carried her to one of the windows; with a moments pressure on his arm, Hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky
[14655]7067    He watched her until she became a tiny black speck and vanished, then switched his gaze to Hagrid's hut, clearly visible from this window, and just as clearly uninhabited, the chimney smokeless, the curtains drawn
[14656]300   The treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light breeze
[14657]6891    Harry watched them, savouring the fresh air on his face, thinking about Quidditch later 
[14658]0   
[14659]0   
[14660]326    then he saw it
[14661]8952    A great, reptilian winged hcrse, just like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leahery black wings spread wide like a pterodactyl's, rose up out of the trees like a grotesque, giant bird
[14662]378    It soared in a great circle, then plunged back into the trees
[14663]6665    The whole thing had happened so quickly, Harry could hardly believe what he had seen, except that his heart was hammering madly
[14664]679   The Owlery door opened behind him
[14665]1174    He leapt in shock and, turning quickly, saw Cho Chang holding a letter and a parcel in his hands
[14666]10860   Hi,' said Harry automatically
[14667]362   Oh 
[14668]0   
[14669]0   
[14670]5129    hi,' she said breathlessly
[14671]3311    I didn't think anyone would be up here this early 
[14672]0   
[14673]0   
[14674]9892    I only remembered five minutes ago, it's my mum's birthday'She held up the parcel
[14675]11375   Right,' said Harry
[14676]55    His brain seemed to have jammed
[14677]820    He wanted to say something funny and interesting, but the memory of that terrible winged horse was fresh in his mind
[14678]5375   Nice day,' he said, gesturing to the windows
[14679]24    His insides seemed to shrivel with embarrassment
[14680]12    The weather
[14681]156    He was talking about the weather

[14684]6226    Yeah,' said Cho, looking around for a suitable owl
[14685]499    Good Quidditch conditions
[14686]2493    I haven't been out all week, have you
[14687]10818  'No,' said Harry
[14688]445   Cho had selected one of the school barn owls
[14689]212    She coaxed it down on to her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach the parcel
[14690]1072   Hey has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet
[14691]356  ' she asked
[14692]11095   Yeah,' said Harry
[14693]8841    It's my friend Ron Weasley, d'you know him
[14694]7  'The Tornados-hater
[14695]5262  ' said Cho rather coolly
[14696]343    Is he any good
[14697]11657  'Yeah,' said Harry, I think so
[14698]2755    I didn't see his tryout, though, I was in detention
[14699]5948   'Cho looked up, the parcel only half-attached to the owl's legs
[14700]11117   That Umbridge woman's foul,' she said in a low voice
[14701]1308    Putting you in detention just because you told the truth about how-how-how he died
[14702]496    Everyone heard about it, it was all over the school
[14703]1190    You were really brave standing up to her like that
[14704]11191   'Harry's insides re-inflated so rapidly he felt as though he might actually float a few inches off the dropping-strewn floor
[14705]1025    Who cared about a stupid flying horse; Cho thought he had been really brave
[14706]867    For a moment, he considered accidentally-on-purpose showing her his cut hand as he helped her tie her parcel on to her owl 
[14707]0   
[14708]0   
[14709]1102    but the very instant this thrilling thought occurred, the Owlery door opened again
[14710]790   Filch the caretaker came wheezing into the room
[14711]402    There were purple patches on his sunken, veined cheeks, his jowls were aquiver and his thin grey hair dishevelled; he had obviously run here
[14712]369    Mrs
[14713]414    Norris came trotting at his heels, gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing hungrily
[14714]475    There was a restless shifting of wings from above and a large brown owl snapped his beak in a menacing fashion
[14715]5   Aha
[14716]11217  ' said Filch, taking a flat-footed step towards Harry, his pouchy cheeks trembling with anger
[14717]1104    I've had a tip-off that you are intending to place a massive order for Dungbombs
[14718]5958  'Harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker
[14719]341   Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs
[14720]7310  'Cho was looking from Harry to Filch, also frowning; the barn owl on her arm, tired of standing on one leg, gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored it
[14721]5   I have my sources
[14722]5237   ' said Filch in a self-satisfied hiss
[14723]376    Now hand over whatever it is you're sending
[14724]18277   'Feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off the letter, Harry said, I can't, it's gone
[14725]129   'Gone
[14726]5747  ' said Filch, his face contorting with rage
[14727]10978   Gone,' said Harry calmly
[14728]11712   Filch opened his mouth furiously, mouthed for a few seconds, then raked Harry's robes with his eyes
[14729]3944   How do I know you haven't got it in your pocket
[14730]5664  'Because-'I saw him send it,' said Cho angrily
[14731]122   Filch rounded on her
[14732]326   You saw him-
[14733]10738  'That's right, I saw him,' she said fiercely
[14734]6930   There was a moment's pause in which Filch glared at Cho and Cho glared right back, then the caretaker turned on his heel and shuffled back towards the door
[14735]6901    He stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at Harry
[14736]5   If I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb 
[14737]0   
[14738]0   
[14739]81   'He stumped off down the stairs
[14740]369    Mrs
[14741]705    Norris cast a last longing look at the owls and followed him
[14742]6558   Harry and Cho looked at each other
[14743]10858   Thanks,' Harry said
[14744]10955   No problem,' said Cho, finally fixing the parcel to the barn owl's other leg, her face slightly pink
[14745]2374    You weren't ordering Dungbombs, were you
[14746]10818  ' No,' said Harry
[14747]418   I wonder why he thought you were, then
[14748]5372  ' she said as she carried the owl to the window
[14749]5749   Harry shrugged
[14750]483    He was quite as mystified by that as she was, though oddly it was not bothering him very much at the moment
[14751]286   They left the Owlery together
[14752]6931    At the entrance of a corridor that led towards the west wing of the castle, Cho said, I'm going this way
[14753]567   Well, I'll 
[14754]0   
[14755]0   
[14756]6299    I'll see you around, Harry
[14757]277   'Yeah 
[14758]0   
[14759]0   
[14760]0    see you
[14761]43   'She smiled at him and departed
[14762]6194    Harry walked on, feeling quietly elated
[14763]115    He had managed to have an entire conversation with her and not embarrassed himself once 
[14764]0   
[14765]0   
[14766]1190    you were really brave standing up to her like that 
[14767]0   
[14768]0   
[14769]288   Cho had called him brave 
[14770]0   
[14771]0   
[14772]722    she did not hate him for being alive 
[14773]0   
[14774]0   
[14775]544   Of course, she had preferred Cedric, he knew that 
[14776]0   
[14777]0   
[14778]1513    though if he'd only asked her to the Ball before Cedric had, things might have turned out differently 
[14779]0   
[14780]0   
[14781]6814    she had seemed sincerely sorry that she'd had to refuse when Harry asked her 
[14782]0   
[14783]0   
[14784]15467   Morning,' Harry said brightly to Ron and Hermione as he joined them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall
[14785]664   What are you looking so pleased about
[14786]12878  ' said Ron, eyeing Harry in surprise
[14787]13   Erm 
[14788]0   
[14789]0   
[14790]11447    Quidditch later,' said Harry happily, pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs towards him
[14791]362   Oh 
[14792]0   
[14793]0   
[14794]277    yeah 
[14795]0   
[14796]0   
[14797]7088   ' said Ron
[14798]543    He put down the piece of toast he was eating and took a large swig of pumpkin juice
[14799]5161    Then he said, Listen 
[14800]0   
[14801]0   
[14802]3647    you don't fancy going out a bit earlier with me, do you
[14803]993   Just to-er-give me some practice before training
[14804]1119   So I can, you know, get my eye in a bit
[14805]11177   'Yeah, OK,' said Harry
[14806]10694   Look, I don't think you should,' said Hermione seriously
[14807]1138    You're both really behind on homework as it-'But she broke off; the morning post was arriving and, as usual, the Daily Prophet was soaring towards her in the beak of a screech owl, which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg
[14808]2283    Hermione pushed a Knut into its leather pouch, took the newspaper, and scanned the front page critically as the owl took off
[14809]25   Anything interesting
[14810]7088  ' said Ron
[14811]7916    Harry grinned, knowing Ron was keen to keep her off the subject of homework
[14812]988   No,' she sighed, just some guff about the bass player in the Weird Sisters getting married
[14813]1870   'Hermione opened the paper and disappeared behind it
[14814]5788    Harry devoted himself to another helping of eggs and bacon
[14815]3132    Ron was staring up at the high windows, looking slightly preoccupied
[14816]7146   Wait a moment,' said Hermione suddenly
[14817]362    Oh no 
[14818]0   
[14819]0   
[14820]647    Sirius
[14821]4893  'What's happened
[14822]12848  ' said Harry, snatching at the paper so violently it ripped down the middle, with him and Hermione each holding one half
[14823]1422   ' The Ministry of Magic has received a tip-off from a reliable source that Sirius Black, notorious mass murderer

[14830]1957  Hermione read from her half in an anguished whisper
[14831]12573   Lucius Malfoy, I'll bet anything,' said Harry in a low, furious voice
[14832]1338    He did recognise Sirius on the platform 
[14833]0   
[14834]0   
[14835]0   'What

[14837]2985    You didn't say-'Shh

[14851]10307    the usual rubbish,' Hermione concluded, laying down her half of the paper and looking fearfully at Harry and Ron
[14852]8585    Well, he just won't be able to leave the house again, that's all,' she whispered
[14853]1495    Dumbledore did warn him not to
[14854]6679   'Harry looked down glumly at the bit of the Prophet he had torn off
[14855]5232    Most of the page was devoted to an advertisement for Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, which was apparently having a sale
[14856]26   Hey
[14857]8705  ' he said, flattening it down so Hermione and Ron could see it
[14858]457    Look at this
[14859]8958  'I've got all the robes I want,' said Ron
[14860]10818   No,' said Harry
[14861]457    Look 
[14862]0   
[14863]0   
[14864]327    this little piece here 
[14865]0   
[14866]0   
[14867]4868   'Ron and Hermione bent closer to read it; the item was barely an inch long and placed right at the bottom of a column
[14868]955    It was headlined:TRESPASS AT MINISTRY Sturgis Podmore, 38, of number two, Laburnum Gardens, Clapham, has appeared in front of the Wizcngamot charged with trespass and attempted robbery at the Ministry of Magic on 31st August
[14869]1646    Podmore was arrested by Ministry of Magic watchwizard Eric Munch, who found him attempting to force his way through a top-security door at one o'clock in the morning
[14870]284    Podmore, who refused to speak, in his own defence, was convicted on both charges and sentenced to six months in Azkaban
[14871]35    Sturgis Podmore
[14872]7214  ' said Ron slowly
[14873]13234    He's that bloke who looks like his head's been thatched, isn't he
[14874]6760   He's one of the Ord-Ron, shh
[14875]7203  ' said Hermione, casting a terrified look around them
[14876]100   Six months in Azkaban
[14877]5882  ' whispered Harry, shocked
[14878]1539    Just for trying to get through a door
[14879]6947  'Don't be silly, it wasn't just for trying to get through a door
[14880]913    What on earth was he doing at the Ministry of Magic at one o'clock in the morning
[14881]1637  ' breathed Hermione
[14882]1005   D'you reckon he was doing something for the Order
[14883]2109  ' Ron muttered
[14884]342   Wait a moment 
[14885]0   
[14886]0

[14888]653    Sturgis was supposed to come and see us off, remember
[14889]676  'The other two looked at him
[14890]5798   Yeah, he was supposed to be part of our guard going to King's Cross, remember
[14891]5372   And Moody was all annoyed because he didn't turn up; so he couldn't have been on a job for them, could he
[14892]9636  'Well, maybe they didn't expect him to get caught,' said Hermione
[14893]14   It could be a frame-up
[14894]2033  ' Ron exclaimed excitedly
[14895]75    No-listen
[14896]8128  ' he went on, dropping his voice dramatically at the threatening look on Hermione's face
[14897]14079    The Ministry suspects he's one of Dumbledore's lot so-I dunno-they lured him to the Ministry, and he wasn't trying to get through a door at all
[14898]1574   Maybe they've just made something up to get him
[14899]7392  'There was a pause while Harry and Hermione considered this
[14900]6264    Harry thought it seemed far-fetched
[14901]2661    Hermione, on the other hand, looked rather impressed
[14902]3286   Do you know, I wouldn't be at all surprised if that were true
[14903]224   'She folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully
[14904]6218    As Harry laid down his knife and fork, she seemed to come out of a reverie
[14905]7108   Right, well, I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on self-fertilising shrubs first and if we're lucky we'll be able to start McGonagall's Inanimatus Conjurus Spell before lunch 
[14906]0   
[14907]0   
[14908]6946   'Harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of homework awaiting him upstairs, but the sky was a clear, exhilarating blue, and he had not been on his Firebolt for a week 
[14909]0   
[14910]0   
[14911]20076   I mean, we can do it tonight,' said Ron, as he and Harry walked down the sloping lawns towards the Quidditch pitch, their broomsticks over their shoulders, and with Hermione's dire warnings that they would fail all their OWLs still ringing in their ears
[14912]1424    And we've got tomorrow
[14913]4970    She gets too worked up about work, that's her trouble 
[14914]0   
[14915]0   
[14916]9022   ' There was a pause and he added, in a slightly more anxious tone, D'you think she meant it when she said we weren't copying from her
[14917]11095  'Yeah, I do,' said Harry
[14918]2097    Still, this is important, too, we've got to practise if we want to stay on the Quidditch team 
[14919]0   
[14920]0   
[14921]12704   'Yeah, that's right,' said Ron, in a heartened tone
[14922]1266    And we have got plenty of time to do it all 
[14923]0   
[14924]0   
[14925]6817   'As they approached the Quidditch pitch, Harry glanced over to his right to where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly
[14926]262    Nothing flew out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around the Owlery tower
[14927]2981    He had enough to worry about; the flying horse wasn't doing him any harm; he pushed it out of his mind
[14928]10997   They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work, Ron guarding the three tall goalposts, Harry playing Chaser and trying to get the Quaffle past Ron
[14929]14683    Harry thought Ron was pretty good; he blocked three-quarters of the goals Harry attempted to put past him and played better the longer they practised
[14930]2919    After a couple of hours they returned to the castle for lunch-during which Hermione made it quite clear she thought they were irresponsible-then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the real training session
[14931]633    All their teammates but Angelina were already in the changing room when they entered
[14932]2559   All right, Ron
[14933]5475  ' said George, winking at him
[14934]7782   Yeah,' said Ron, who had become quieter and quieter all the way down to the pitch
[14935]147   Ready to show us all up, Ickle Prefect
[14936]6623  ' said Fred, emerging tousle-haired from the neck of his Quidditch robes, a slightly malicious grin on his face
[14937]8105   Shut up,' said Ron, stony-faced, pulling on his own team robes for the first time
[14938]4957    They fitted him well considering they had been Oliver Wood's, who was rather broader in the shoulder
[14939]10217   OK, everyone,' said Angelina, entering from the Captain's office, already changed
[14940]6401    Let's get to it; Alicia and Fred, if you can just bring out the ball crate for us
[14941]2592    Oh, and there are a couple of people out there watching but I want you to just ignore them, all right
[14942]9422  'Something in her would-be casual voice made Harry think he might know who the uninvited spectators were, and sure enough, when they left the changing room for the bright sunlight of the pitch it was to a storm of catcalls and jeers from the Slytherin Quidditch team and assorted hangers-on, who were grouped halfway up the empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly around the stadium
[14943]10140   What's that Weasley's riding
[14944]572  ' Malfoy called in his sneering drawl
[14945]1049    Why would anyone put a flying charm on a mouldy old log like that
[14946]284  'Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter
[14947]8450    Ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground and Harry followed him, watching his ears turn red from behind
[14948]12554   Ignore them,' he said, accelerating to catch up with Ron, we'll see who's laughing after we play them 
[14949]0   
[14950]0   
[14951]11641   'Exactly the attitude I want, Harry,' said Angelina approvingly soaring around them with the Quaffle under her arm and slowing to hover on the spot in front of her airborne team
[14952]6371    OK, everyone, we're going to start with some passes just to warm up, the whole team please-'Hey, Johnson, what's with that hairstyle, anyway
[14953]70  ' shrieked Pansy Parkinson from below
[14954]3507    Why would anyone want to look like they've got worms coming out of their head
[14955]6383  'Angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and continued calmly, Spread out, then, and let's see what we can do 
[14956]0   
[14957]0   
[14958]6276   'Harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch
[14959]2215    Ron fell back towards the opposite goal
[14960]9800    Angelina raised the Quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to Fred, who passed to George, who passed to Harry, who passed to Ron, who dropped it
[14961]673   The Slytherins, led by Malfoy, roared and screamed with laughter
[14962]2687    Ron, who had pelted towards the ground to catch the Quaffle before it landed, pulled out of the dive untidily, so that he slipped sideways on his broom, and returned to playing height, blushing
[14963]12059    Harry saw Fred and George exchange looks, but uncharacteristically neither of them said anything, for which he was grateful
[14964]2379   Pass it on, Ron,' called Angelina, as though nothing had happened
[14965]8479   Ron threw the Quaffle to Alicia, who passed back to Harry, who passed to George 
[14966]0   
[14967]0   
[14968]5495   Hey, Potter, how's your scar feeling
[14969]559  ' called Malfoy
[14970]3373    Sure you don't need a lie down
[14971]7334   It must be, what, a whole week since you were in the hospital wing, that's a record for you, isn't it
[14972]8971  'George passed to Angelina; she reverse-passed to Harry, who had not been expecting it, but caught it in the very tips of his fingers and passed it quickly to Ron, who lunged for it and missed by inches
[14973]7792   Come on now, Ron,' said Angelina crossly, as he dived for the ground again, chasing the Quaffle
[14974]58    Pay attention
[14975]7910   'It would have been hard to say whether Ron's face or the Quaffle was a deeper scarlet when he again returned to playing height
[14976]861    Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team were howling with laughter
[14977]8216   On his third attempt, Ron caught the Quaffle; perhaps out of relief he passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight though Katie's outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face
[14978]95   Sorry
[14979]2113  ' Ron groaned, zooming forwards to see whether he had done any damage
[14980]4852   Get back in position, she's fine
[14981]102  ' barked Angelina
[14982]2632    But as you're passing to a teammate, do try not to knock her off her broom, won't you
[14983]1389   We've got Bludgers for that
[14984]4919  'Katie's nose was bleeding
[14985]301    Down below, the Slytherins were stamping their feet and jeering
[14986]841    Fred and George converged on Katie
[14987]2193   Here, take this,' Fred told her, handing her something small anc purple from out of his pocket, it'll clear it up in no time
[14988]1624   'All right,' called Angelina, Fred, George, go and get your bats and a Bludger
[14989]2007    Ron, get up to the goalposts
[14990]6059    Harry, release the Snitch when I say so
[14991]7317    We're going to aim for Ron's goal, obviously
[14992]5841   'Harry zoomed off after the twins to fetch the Snitch
[14993]14775   Ron's making a right pig's ear of things, isn't he
[14994]772  ' muttered George, as the three of them landed at the crate containing the balls and opened it to extract one of the Bludgers and the Snitch
[14995]16597   He's just nervous,' said Harry, he was fine when I was practising with him this morning
[14996]8304   'Yeah, well, I hope he hasn't peaked too soon,' said Fred gloomily
[14997]218   They returned to the air
[14998]7125    When Angelina blew her whistle, Harry released the Snitch and Fred and George let fly the Bludger
[14999]6272    From that moment on, Harry was barely aware of what the others were doing
[15000]5448    It was his job to recapture the tiny fluttering golden ball that was worth a hundred and fifty points to the Seeker's team and doing so required enormous speed and skill
[15001]931    He accelerated, rolling and swerving in and out of the Chasers, the warm autumn air whipping his face, and the distant yells of the Slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his ears 
[15002]0   
[15003]0   
[15004]160    but too soon, the whistle brought him to a halt again
[15005]399   Stop-stop- STOP
[15006]123  ' screamed Angelina
[15007]2102    Ron-you're not covering your middle post
[15008]9312  'Harry looked round at Ron, who was hovering in front of the left-hand hoop, leaving the other two completely unprotected
[15009]362   Oh 
[15010]0   
[15011]0   
[15012]95    sorry 
[15013]0   
[15014]0   
[15015]156   'You keep shifting around while you're watching the Chasers
[15016]5173  ' said Angelina
[15017]8187    Either stay in centre position until you have to move to defend a hoop, or else circle the hoops, but don't drift vaguely off to one side, that's how you let in the last three goals
[15018]95  'Sorry 
[15019]0   
[15020]0   
[15021]3586   ' Ron repeated, his red face shining like a beacon against the bright blue sky
[15022]2346   And Katie, can't you do something about that nosebleed
[15023]5727  'It's just getting worse
[15024]5175  ' said Katie thickly, attempting to stem the flow with her sleeve
[15025]7015   Harry glanced round at Fred, who was looking anxious and checking his pockets
[15026]1668    He saw Fred pull out something purple, examine it for a second and then look round at Katie, evidently horror-struck
[15027]10329   Well, let's try again,' said Angelina
[15028]747    She was ignoring the Slytherins, who had now set up a chant of Gryffindor are losers, Gryffindor are losers,' but there was a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom nevertheless
[15029]878   This time they had been flying for barely three minutes when Angelinas whistle sounded
[15030]7005    Harry, who had just sighted the Snitch circling the opposite goalpost, pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved
[15031]0   What now
[15032]5203  ' he said impatiently to Alicia, who was nearest
[15033]5151   Katie,' she said shortly
[15034]7465   Harry turned and saw Angelina, Fred and George all flying as fast as they could towards Katie
[15035]5790    Harry and Alicia sped towards her, too
[15036]1888    It was plain that Angelina had stopped training just in time; Katie was now chalk white and covered in blood
[15037]5299   She needs the hospital wing,' said Angelina
[15038]6081   We'll take her,' said Fred
[15039]11423    She-er-might have swallowed a Blood Blisterpod by mistake-'Well, there's no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser gone,' said Angelina glumly as Fred and George zoomed off towards the castle supporting Katie between them
[15040]5533    Come on, let's go and get changed
[15041]180   'The Slytherins continued to chant as they trailed back into the changing rooms
[15042]40   How was practice
[15043]10961  ' asked Hermione rather coolly half an hour later, as Harry and Ron climbed through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room
[15044]5853   It was-' Harry began
[15045]9471   Completely lousy,' said Ron in a hollow voice, sinking into a chair beside Hermione
[15046]2695    She looked up at Ron and her frost mess seemed to melt
[15047]15526   Well, it was only your first one,' she said consolingly, it's bound to take time to-'Who said it was me who made it lousy
[15048]2053  ' snapped Ron
[15049]8233   No one,' said Hermione, looking taken aback, I thought-'You thought I was bound to be rubbish
[15050]2925  'No, of course I didn't
[15051]14911   Look, you said it was lousy so I just-'I'm going to get started on some homework,' said Ron angrily and stomped off to the staircase to the boys' dormitories and vanished from sight
[15052]7679    Hermione turned to Harry
[15053]11   Was he lousy
[15054]10819  'No,' said Harry loyally
[15055]1782   Hermione raised her eyebrows
[15056]12637   Well, I suppose he could've played better,' Harry muttered, but it was only the first training session, like you said 
[15057]0   
[15058]0   
[15059]8199   'Neither Harry nor Ron seemed to make much headway with their homework that night
[15060]9166    Harry knew Ron was too preoccupied with how badly he had performed at Quidditch practice and he himself was having difficulty in getting the Gryffindor are losers' chant out of his head
[15061]609   They spent the whole of Sunday in the common room, buried in 
[15062]595   heir books while the room around them filled up, then emptied
[15063]817    It was another clear, fine day and most of their fellow Gryffindors spent the day out in the grounds, enjoying what might well be some of the last sunshine that year
[15064]6424    By the evening, Harry felt as though somebody had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull
[15065]26271   You know, we probably should try and get more homework done during the week,' Harry muttered to Ron, as they finally laid aside Professor McGonagall's long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus Spell and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra's equally long and difficult essay about Jupiter's many moons
[15066]8418   Yeah,' said Ron, rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing his fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them
[15067]75    Listen 
[15068]0   
[15069]0   
[15070]7740    shall we just ask Hermione if we can have a look at what she's done
[15071]6586  'Harry glanced over at her; she was sitting with Crookshanks on her lap and chatting merrily to Ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair in front of her, now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks
[15072]8669   No,' he said heavily, you know she won't let us
[15073]290   'And so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became steadily darker
[15074]883    Slowly, the crowd in the common room began to thin again
[15075]1964    At half past eleven, Hermione wandered over to them, yawning
[15076]119   Nearly done
[15077]7119  'No,' said Ron shortly
[15078]27115   Jupiter's biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto,' she said, pointing over Ron's shoulder at a line in his Astronomy essay, and it's Io that's got the volcanoes
[15079]2097   'Thanks,' snarled Ron, scratching out the offending sentences
[15080]11208   Sorry, I only- 'Yeah, well, if you've just come over here to criticise-'Ron-'I haven't got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, I'm up to my neck in it here- 'No-look
[15081]1913  'Hermione was pointing to the nearest window
[15082]8410    Harry and Ron both looked over
[15083]2780    A handsome screech owl was standing on the windowsill, gazing into the room at Ron
[15084]2412   Isn't that Hermes
[15085]6752  ' said Hermione, sounding amazed
[15086]17   Blimey, it is
[15087]7686  ' said Ron quietly, throwing down his quill and getting to his feet
[15088]4922    What's Percy writing to me for
[15089]7630  'He crossed to the window and opened it; Hermes flew inside, landed on Ron's essay and held out a leg to which a letter was attached
[15090]9296    Ron took the letter off it and the owl departed at once, leaving inky footprints across Ron's drawing of the moon Io
[15091]18586   That's definitely Percy's handwriting,' said Ron, sinking back into his chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll: Ronald Weasley, Gryffindor House, Hogwarts
[15092]676    He looked up at the other two
[15093]671    What d'you reckon
[15094]245  'Open it
[15095]12542  ' said Hermione eagerly, and Harry nodded
[15096]2264   Ron unrolled the scroll and began to read
[15097]625    The further clown the parchment his eyes travelled, the more pronounced became his scowl
[15098]808    When he had finished reading, he looked disgusted
[15099]12970    He thrust the letter at Harry and Hermione, who leaned towards each other to read it together:Dear Ron,I have only just heard (from no less a person than the Minister for Magic himself, who has it from your new teacher, Professor Umbridge) that you have become a Hogwarts prefect
[15100]404   I was most pleasantly surprised when f heard this news and must firstly offer my congratulations
[15101]1410    I must admit that I have always been afraid that you would take what we might call the Fred and George' route, rather than following in my footsteps, so you can imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting authority and have decided to shoulder some real responsibility
[15102]3118   But I want to give you more than congratulations, Ron, I want to give you some advice, which is why I am sending this at night rather than by the usual morning post
[15103]1176    Hopefully, you will be able to read this away from prying eyes and avoid awkward questions
[15104]6892   From something the Minister let slip when telling me you are now a prefect, I gather that you are still seeing a lot of Harry Potter
[15105]2641    I must tell you, Ron, that nothing could put you in danger of losing your badge more than continued fraternisation with that boy
[15106]14422    Yes, I am sure you are surprised to hear this- no doubt you will say that Potter has always been Dumbledore's favourite-but I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very different-and probably more accurate-view of Potter's behaviour
[15107]1766    I shall say no more here, but if you look at the Daily Prophet tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blowing-and see if you can spot yours truly
[15108]3304  Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as Potter, it could be very damaging to your future prospects, and I am talking here about life after school, too
[15109]2884    As you must be aware, given that our father escorted him to court, Potter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole Wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good
[15110]1888    He got off on a mere technicality, if you ask me, and many of the people I've spoken to remain convinced of his guilt
[15111]8911   It may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter-I know that he can be unbalanced and, for all I know, violent-but if you have any worries about this, or have spotted anything else in Potter's behaviour that is troubling you, I urge you to speak to Dolores Umbridge, a truly delightful woman who I know will be only too happy to advise you
[15112]212   This leads me to my other bit of advice
[15113]5884    As I have hinted above, Dumbledore's regime at Hogwarts may soon be over
[15114]2453    Your loyalty, Ron, should be not to him, but to the school and the Ministry
[15115]2990    I am very sorry to hear that, so far, Professor Umbridge is encountering very little co-operation from staff as she strives to make those necessary changes within Hogwarts that the Ministry so ardently desires (although she should find this easier from next week- again, see the Daily Prophet tomorrow
[15116]0  )
[15117]2524    I shall say only this-a student who shows himself willing to help Professor Umbridge now may be very well-placed for Head Boyship in a couple of years
[15118]191  I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the summer
[15119]1192    It pains me to criticise our parents, but I am afraid I can no longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around Dumbledore
[15120]6871    (If you are writing to Mother at any point, you might tell her that a certain Sturgis Podmore, who is a great friend of Dumbledore's, has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry
[15121]876    Perhaps that will open their eyes to the kind of petty criminals with whom they are currently rubbing shoulders
[15122]2969   ) I count myself very lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such people-the Minister really could not be more gracious to me-and I do hope, Ron, that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided nature of our parents' beliefs and actions, either
[15123]1144    I sincerely hope that, in time, they will realise how mistaken they were and I shall, of course, be ready to accept a full apology when that day comes
[15124]12197   Please think over what I have said most carefully, particularly the bit about Harry Potter, and congratulations again on becoming prefect
[15125]2703   Your brother,PercyHarry looked up at Ron
[15126]6092   Well,' he said, trying to sound as though he found the whole thing a joke, if you want to-er -what is it
[15127]8098  '-he checked Percy's letter-'Oh yeah-"sever ties with me, I swear I won't get violent
[15128]7533   'Give it back,' said Ron, holding out his hand
[15129]17094    He is-' Ron said jerkily, tearing Percy's letter in half the world's-' he tore it into quarters biggest-' he tore it into eighths git
[15130]80   ' He threw the pieces into the fire
[15131]18346   Come on, we've got to get this finished sometime before dawn,' he said briskly to Harry, pulling Professor Sinistra's essay back towards him
[15132]4867   Hermione was looking at Ron with an odd expression on her face
[15133]5471   Oh, give them here,' she said abruptly
[15134]0   What
[15135]7088  ' said Ron
[15136]6126   Give them to me, I'll look through them and correct them,' she said
[15137]0   Are you serious
[15138]8835   Ah, Hermione, you're a life-saver,' said Ron, what can I-
[15139]7294  'What you can say is, We promise we'll never leave our homework this late again, ' she said, holding out both hands for their essays, but she looked slightly amused all the same
[15140]13092   Thanks a million, Hermione,' said Harry weakly, passing over his essay and sinking back into his armchair, rubbing his eyes
[15141]775   It was now past midnight and the common room was deserted but for the three of them and Crookshanks
[15142]6911    The only sound was that of Hermione's quill scratching out sentences here and there on their essays and the ruffle of pages as she checked various facts in the reference books strewn across the table
[15143]5747    Harry was exhausted
[15144]801    He also felt an odd, sick, empty feeling in his stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling blackly in the heart of the fire
[15145]11154   He knew that half the people inside Hogwarts thought him strange, even mad; he knew that the Daily Prophet had been making snide allusions to him for months, but there was something about seeing it written down like that in Percy's writing, about knowing that Percy was advising Ron to drop him and even to tell tales about him to Umbridge, that made his situation real to him as nothing else had
[15146]1821    He had known Percy for four years, had stayed in his house during the summer holidays, shared a tent with him during the Quidditch World Cup, had even been awarded full marks by him in the second task of the Triwizard Tournament last year, yet now, Percy thought him unbalanced and possibly violent
[15147]8803   And with a surge of sympathy for his godfather, Harry thought Sirius was probably the only person he knew who could really understand how he felt at the moment, because Sirius was in the same situation
[15148]2026    Nearly everyone in the wizarding world thought Sirius a dangerous murderer and a great Voldemort supporter and he had had to live with that knowledge for fourteen years 
[15149]0   
[15150]0   
[15151]5746   Harry blinked
[15152]991    He had just seen something in the fire that could not have been there
[15153]213    It had flashed into sight and vanished immediately
[15154]0    No 
[15155]0   
[15156]0   
[15157]0    it could not have been 
[15158]0   
[15159]0   
[15160]747    he had imagined it because he had been thinking about Sirius 
[15161]0   
[15162]0   
[15163]11737   OK, write that down,' Hermione said to Ron, pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own writing back to Ron, then add this conclusion I've written for you
[15164]18124   'Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met,' said Ron weakly, and if I'm ever rude to you again-'-I'll know you're back to normal,' said Hermione
[15165]18109    Harry, yours is OK except for this bit at the end, I think you must have misheard Professor Sinistra, Europa's covered in ice, not mice-Harry
[15166]6048  'Harry had slid off his chair on to his knees and was now crouching on the singed and threadbare hearthrug, gazing into the flames
[15167]5853   Er-Harry
[15168]7105  ' said Ron uncertainly
[15169]0    Why are you down there
[15170]18389  'Because I've just seen Sirius's head in the fire,' said Harry
[15171]7824   He spoke quite calmly; after all, he had seen Sirius's head in this very fire the previous year and talked to it, too; nevertheless, he could not be sure that he had really seen it this time 
[15172]0   
[15173]0   
[15174]213    it had vanished so quickly 
[15175]0   
[15176]0   
[15177]5887   Sirius's head
[15178]1668  ' Hermione repeated
[15179]1275    You mean like when he wanted to talk to you during the Triwizard Tournament
[15180]3068   But he wouldn't do that now, it would be too-Sirius
[15181]2238  'She gasped, gazing at the fire; Ron dropped his quill
[15182]7536    There in the middle of the dancing flames sat Sirius's head, long dark hair failing around his grinning face
[15183]6527   I was starting to think you'd go to bed before everyone else had disappeared,' he said
[15184]789    I've been checking every hour
[15185]786   'You've been popping into the fire every hour
[15186]11049  ' Harry said, half-laughing
[15187]986   Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear
[15188]804   'But what if you'd been seen
[15189]6736  ' said Hermione anxiously
[15190]15834   Well, I think a girl-first-year, by the look of her-might've get a glimpse of me earlier, but don't worry,' Sirius said hastily, as Hermione clapped a hand to her mouth, I was gone the moment she looked back at me and I'll bet she just thought I was an oddly-shaped log or something
[15191]2544   'But, Sirius, this is taking an awful risk-' Hermione began
[15192]6610   You sound like Molly,' said Sirius
[15193]11376    This was the only way I could come up with of answering Harry's letter without resorting to a code-and codes are breakable
[15194]14572   'At the mention of Harry's letter, Hermione and Ron both turned to stare at him
[15195]4285   You didn't say you'd written to Sirius
[15196]6703   said Hermione accusingly
[15197]11310   I forgot,' said Harry, which was perfectly true; his meeting with Cho in the Owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind
[15198]7512    Don't look at me like that, Hermione, there was no way anyone would have got secret information out of it, was there, Sirius
[15199]6142  'No, it was very good,' said Sirius, smiling
[15200]1815    Anyway, we'd better be quick, just in case we're disturbed-your scar
[15201]0   'What about-
[15202]3759  ' Ron began, but Hermione interrupted him
[15203]899   We'll tell you afterwards
[15204]647    Go on, Sirius
[15205]6939   'Well, I know it can't be fun when it hurts, but we don't think its anything to really worry about
[15206]3014    It kept aching all last year, didn't it
[15207]26062  'Yeah, and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion,' said Harry, ignoring, as usual, Ron and Hermione's winces
[15208]1513    So maybe he was just, I dunno, really angry or something the night I had that detention
[15209]15328   'Well, now he's back it's bound to hurt more often,' said Sirius
[15210]4127   So you don't think it had anything to do with Umbridge touching me when I was in detention with her
[15211]6088  ' Harry asked
[15212]5760   I doubt it,' said Sirius
[15213]25710    I know her by reputation and I'm sure she's no Death Eater-'She's foul enough to be one,' said Harry darkly, and Ron and Hermione nodded vigorously in agreement
[15214]9526   Yes, but the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters,' said Sirius with a wry smile
[15215]6012    I know she's a nasty piece of work, though-you should hear Remus talk about her
[15216]1024   'Does Lupin know her
[15217]11879  ' asked Harry quickly, remembering Umbridge's comments about dangerous half-breeds during her first lesson
[15218]6292   No,' said Sirius, but she drafted a bit of anti-werewolf legislation two years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job
[15219]7275   'Harry remembered how much shabbier Lupin looked these days and his dislike of Umbridge deepened even further
[15220]5446   What's she got against werewolves
[15221]6784  ' said Hermione angrily
[15222]5893   Scared of them, I expect,' said Sirius, smiling at her indignation
[15223]271    Apparently, she loathes part-humans; she campaigned to have merpeople rounded up and tagged last year, too
[15224]1754    Imagine wasting your time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags like Kreacher on the loose
[15225]4364   'Ron laughed but Hermione looked upset
[15226]647   Sirius
[15227]5090  ' she said reproachfully
[15228]1639    Honestly, if you made a bit of an effort with Kreacher, I'm sure he'd respond
[15229]18576    After all, you are the only member of his family he's got left, and Professor Dumbledore said-'So, what are Umbridge's lessons like
[15230]668  ' Sirius interrupted
[15231]293    Is she training you all to kill half-breeds
[15232]17895  'No,' said Harry, ignoring Hermione's affronted look at being cut off in her defence of Kreacher
[15233]5080    She's not letting us use magic at all
[15234]7289  'All we do is read the stupid textbook,' said Ron
[15235]5803   Ah, well, that figures,' said Sirius
[15236]3415    Our information from inside the Ministry is that Fudge doesn't want you trained in combat
[15237]12   'Trained in combat
[15238]5799  ' repeated Harry incredulously
[15239]1073    What does he think we're doing here, forming some sort of wizard army
[15240]26804  'That's exactly what he thinks you're doing,' said Sirius, or, rather, that's exactly what he's afraid Dumbledore's doing-forming his own private army, with which he will be able to take on the Ministry of Magic
[15241]13357   'There was a pause at this, then Ron said, That's the most stupid thing I've ever heard, including all the stuff that Luna Lovegood comes out with
[15242]1633   'So we're being prevented from learning Defence Against the Dark Arts because Fudge is scared we'll use spells against the Ministry
[15243]7333  ' said Hermione, looking furious
[15244]5740   Yep,' said Sirius
[15245]1258    Fudge thinks Dumbledore will stop at nothing to seize power
[15246]5843    He's getting more paranoid about Dumbledore by the day
[15247]6229    It's a matter of time before he has Dumbledore arrested on some trumped-up charge
[15248]10714   'This reminded Harry of Percy's letter
[15249]7603   D'you know if there's going to be anything about Dumbledore in the Daily Prophet tomorrow
[15250]19182   Ron's brother Percy reckons there will be-'I don't know,' said Sirius, I haven't seen anyone from the Order all weekend, they're all busy
[15251]5676    It's just been Kreacher and me here
[15252]5999   'There was a definite note of bitterness in Sirius's voice
[15253]3144   So you haven't had any news about Hagrid, either
[15254]51  'Ah 
[15255]0   
[15256]0   
[15257]15695   ' said Sirius, well, he was supposed to be back by now, no one's sure what's happened to him
[15258]15059   ' Then, seeing their stricken faces, he added quickly, But Dumbledore's not worried, so don't you three get yourselves in a state; I'm sure Hagrid's fine
[15259]92   'But if he was supposed to be back by now 
[15260]0   
[15261]0   
[15262]7422   ' said Hermione in a small, anxious voice
[15263]16073   Madame Maxime was with him, we've been in touch with her and she says they got separated on the journey home-but there's nothing to suggest he's hurt or-well, nothing to suggest he's not perfectly OK
[15264]9515   'Unconvinced, Harry, Ron and Hermione exchanged worried looks
[15265]20120   Listen, don't go asking too many questions about Hagrid,' said Sirius hastily, it'll just draw even more attention to the fact that he's not back and I know Dumbledore doesn't want that
[15266]6057    Hagrid's tough, he'll be OK
[15267]6222   ' And when they did not appear cheered by this, Sirius added, When's your next Hogsmeade weekend, anyway
[15268]3881   I was thinking, we got away with the dog disguise at the station, didn't we
[15269]388   I thought I could-'NO
[15270]12569  ' said Harry and Hermione together, very loudly
[15271]3469   Sirius, didn't you see the Daily Prophet
[15272]6736  ' said Hermione anxiously
[15273]21790   Oh, that,' said Sirius, grinning, they're always guessing where I am, they haven't really got a clue-'Yeah, but we think this time they have,' said Harry
[15274]11815    Something Malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you, and his father was on the platform, Sirius- you know, Lucius Malfoy-so don't come up here, whatever you do
[15275]8757    If Malfoy recognises you again-'All right, all right, I've got the point,' said Sirius
[15276]678    He looked most displeased
[15277]2041    Just an idea, thought you might like to get together
[15278]4142   'I would, I just don't want you chucked back in Azkaban
[15279]10818  ' said Harry
[15280]7570   There was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the fire at Harry, a crease between his sunken eyes
[15281]6908   You're less like your father than I thought,' he said finally, a definite coolness in his voice
[15282]813    The risk would've been what made it fun for James
[15283]14012   ' Look-'Well, I'd better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs,' said Sirius, but Harry was sure he was lying
[15284]1694    I'll write to tell you a time I can make it back into the fire, then, shall I
[15285]88   If you can stand to risk it
[15286]6161  ' There was a tiny pop, and the place where Sirius's head had been was flickering flame once more

[15314]6913     They had expected to have to comb Hermione's Daily Prophet carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned in his letter
[15315]3336    However, the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores Umbridge, smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline
[15316]950   MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORMDOLORES UMBRIDGE APPOINTEDFIRST EVER HIGH INQUISITORHigh Inquisitor
[15317]11157  ' said Harry darkly, his half-eaten piece of toast slipping from his fingers
[15318]320    What does that mean
[15319]3311  'Hermione read aloud:In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
[15320]6832   "The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings-on at Hogwarts for some time, said Junior Assistant to the Minister, Percy Weasley
[15321]594    He is now responding to concerns, voiced by anxious parents, who feel the school may be moving in a direction they do not approve of
[15322]1407   This is not the first time in recent weeks that the Minister, Cornelius Fudge, has used new laws to effect improvements at the wizarding school
[15323]719    As recently as 30th August, Educational Decree Number Twenty-two was passed, to ensure that, in the event of the current Headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post, the Ministry should select an appropriate person
[15324]11798   "That's how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at Hogwarts, said Weasley last night
[15325]13617    Dumbledore couldn't find anyone so the Minister put in Umbridge, and of course, she's been an immediate success- 'She's been a WHAT
[15326]10954  ' said Harry loudly
[15327]11557   Wait, there's more,' said Hermione grimly
[15328]5977   "-an immediate success, totally revolutionising the teaching of Defence Against the Dark Arts and providing the Minister with on-the-ground feedback about what's really happening at Hogwarts
[15329]915   It is this last function that the Ministry has now formalised with the passing of Educational Decree Number Twenty-three, which creates the new position of Hogwarts High Inquisitor
[15330]11010   "This is an exciting new phase in the Minister's plan to get to grips with what some are calling the falling standards at Hogwarts, said Weasley
[15331]620    The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and make sure that they are coming up to scratch
[15332]1710    Professor Umbridge has been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post and we are delighted to say that she has accepted
[15333]5614   The Ministry's new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at Hogwarts
[15334]7354   "I feel much easier in my mind now that I know Dumbledore is being subjected to fair and objective evaluation, said Mr
[15335]728    Lucius Malfoy, 41, speaking from his Wiltshire mansion last night
[15336]11937    Many of us with our children's best interests at heart have been concerned about some of Dumbledore's eccentric decisions in the last few years and are glad to know that the Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation
[15337]1532   Among those eccentric decisions are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have included the employment of werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid and delusional ex-Auror, Mad-Eye Moody
[15338]1779   Rumours abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious school of Hogwarts
[15339]6434   "I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step towards ensuring that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose our confidence, said a Ministry insider last night
[15340]350   Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts
[15341]10824   "Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge's office, said Madam Marchbanks
[15342]890    This is a further, disgusting attempt to discredit Albus Dumbledore
[15343]5036    (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks's alleged links to subversive goblin groups, turn to page seventeen
[15344]2622   )'Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two
[15345]1363   So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge
[15346]391   Fudge passed this Educational Decree and forced her on us
[15347]4933   And now he's given her the power to inspect the other teachers
[15348]2255  ' Hermione was breathing fast and her eyes were very bright
[15349]2409    I can't believe this
[15350]4753    It's outrageous
[15351]11589  'I know it is,' said Harry
[15352]3046    He looked down at his right hand, clenched on the table-top, and saw the faint white outline of the words Umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin
[15353]7294   But a grin was unfurling on Ron's face
[15354]0   What
[15355]12610  ' said Harry and Hermione together, staring at him
[15356]10134   Oh, I can't wait to see McGonagall inspected,' said Ron happily
[15357]8632    Umbridge won't know what's hit her
[15358]21448   'Well, come on,' said Hermione, jumping up, we'd better get going, if she's inspecting Binns's class we don't want to be late 
[15359]0   
[15360]0   
[15361]19660   'But Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their History of Magic lesson, which was just as dull as the previous Monday, nor was she in Snape's dungeon when they arrived for double Potions, where Harry's moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large, spiky black D' scrawled in an upper corner
[15362]5963   I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your OWL,' said Snape with a smirk, as he swept among them, passing back their homework
[15363]194    This should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in the examination
[15364]1623   'Snape reached the front of the class and turned on his heel to face them
[15365]99   The general standard of this homework was abysmal
[15366]35    Most of you would have failed had this been your examination
[15367]5969    I expect to see a great deal more effort for this week's essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get a D"
[15368]7263   ' He smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper, Some people got a D"
[15369]29   Ha
[15370]8667  'Harry realised that Hermione was looking sideways to see what grade he had received; he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as quickly as possible, feeling that he would rather keep that information private
[15371]6648   Determined not to give Snape an excuse to tail him this lesson, Harry read and reread every line of instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them
[15372]18240    His Strengthening Solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of Hermione's but it was at least blue rather than pink, like Neville's, and he delivered a flask of it to Snape's desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief
[15373]2596   Well, that wasn't as bad as last week, was it
[15374]7491  ' said Hermione, as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across the Entrance Hall towards lunch
[15375]3479    And the homework didn't go too badly, either, did it
[15376]19130  'When neither Ron nor Harry answered, she pressed on, I mean, all right, I didn't expect the top grade, not if he's marking to OWL standard, but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage, wouldn't you say
[15377]5855  'Harry made a non-committal noise in his throat
[15378]4897   Of course, a lot can happen between now and the exam, we've got plenty of time to improve, but the grades we're getting now are a sort of baseline, aren't they
[15379]5   Something we can build on 
[15380]0   
[15381]0   
[15382]532   'They sat down together at the Gryffindor table
[15383]12763   Obviously, I'd have been thrilled if I'd got an O"- ' Hermione,' said Ron sharply, if you want to know what grades we got, ask
[15384]14373   ' I don't-I didn't mean-well, if you want to tell me-'I got a P",' said Ron, ladling soup into his bowl
[15385]54    Happy
[15386]22953  'Well, that's nothing to be ashamed of,' said Fred, who had just arrived at the table with George and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on Harry's right
[15387]445    Nothing wrong with a good healthy P"
[15388]9206   'But,' said Hermione, doesn't P stand for 
[15389]0   
[15390]0   
[15391]5448   '"Poor", yeah,' said Lee Jordan
[15392]3213    Still, better than D", isn't it
[15393]21   Dreadful"
[15394]6768  'Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll
[15395]1862    When he emerged from this he was sorry to find that Hermione was still in full flow about OWL grades
[15396]10160   So top grade's O for Outstanding",' she was saying, and then there's A"-'No, E",' George corrected her, "E for Exceeds Expectations"
[15397]3839    And I've always thought Fred and I should've got E in everything, because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams
[15398]13640   'They all laughed except Hermione, who ploughed on, So, after E it's A for Acceptable", and that's the last pass grade, isn't it
[15399]5744  'Yep,' said Fred, dunking an entire roll in his soup, transferring it to his mouth and swallowing it whole
[15400]2907   Then you get P for Poor"-' Ron raised both his arms in mock celebration-'and D for Dreadful"
[15401]2706   And then T",' George reminded her
[15402]2308   "T"
[15403]2584  ' asked Hermione, looking appalled
[15404]643    Even lower than a D"
[15405]2502   What on earth does T stand for
[15406]5486  '"Troll",' said George promptly
[15407]6392   Harry laughed again, though he was not sure whether or not George was joking
[15408]9187    He imagined trying to conceal from Hermione that he had received T's in all his OWLs and immediately resolved to work harder from now on
[15409]160   You lot had an inspected lesson yet
[15410]784  ' Fred asked them
[15411]6701   No,' said Hermione at once
[15412]0    Have you
[15413]6304  'Just now, before lunch,' said George
[15414]39    Charms
[15415]734   'What was it like
[15416]7703  ' Harry and Hermione asked together
[15417]445   Fred shrugged
[15418]92   Not that bad
[15419]1648    Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard
[15420]9760    You know what Flitwick's like, he treated her like a guest, didn't seem to bother him at all
[15421]2978    She didn't say much
[15422]2244    Asked Alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like, Alicia told her they were really good, that was it
[15423]8763   'I can't see old Flitwick getting marked down,' said George, he usually gets everyone through their exams all right
[15424]1422   'Who've you got this afternoon
[15425]6516  ' Fred asked Harry
[15426]2719   Trelawney-'A T if ever I saw one
[15427]571   '-and Umbridge herself
[15428]6607   'Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today,' said George
[15429]875    Angelina'll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices
[15430]8293   'But Harry did not have to wait for Defence Against the Dark Arts to meet Professor Umbridge
[15431]5442    He was pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when Ron elbowed him in the ribs and, looking round, he saw Professor Umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor
[15432]489    The class, which had been talking cheerily, fell silent at once
[15433]1659    The abrupt fall in the noise level made Professor Trelawney, who had been wafting about handing out copies of The Dream Oracle, look round
[15434]7797   Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,' said Professor Umbridge with her wide smile
[15435]100    You received my note, I trust
[15436]659   Giving the time and date of your inspection
[15437]3341  'Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and, looking very disgruntled, turned her back on Professor Umbridge and continued to give out books
[15438]7445    Still smiling, Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind Professor Trelawney's seat
[15439]1372    She then sat down, took her clipboard from her flowery bag and looked up expectantly, waiting for the class to begin
[15440]1587   Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses
[15441]6161   We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today,' she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, though her voice shook slightly
[15442]792    Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each others latest night-time visions with the aid of the Oracle
[15443]7739   'She made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Umbridge sitting right beside it, and immediately veered left towards Parvati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati's most recent dream
[15444]6711   Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge covertly
[15445]169    She was already making notes on her clipboard
[15446]6742    After a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in Trelawney's wake, listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there
[15447]6345    Harry bent his head hurriedly over his book
[15448]3624   Think of a dream, quick,' he told Ron, in case the old toad comes our way
[15449]8379   ' I did it last time,' Ron protested, it's your turn, you tell me one
[15450]406   'Oh, I dunno 
[15451]0   
[15452]0   
[15453]11042   ' said Harry desperately, who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days
[15454]5356    Let's say I dreamed I was 
[15455]0   
[15456]0   
[15457]525    drowning Snape in my cauldron
[15458]844    Yeah, that'll do

[15460]0   
[15461]2241   'Ron chortled as he opened his Dream Oracle
[15462]1745   OK, we've got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the number of letters in the subject 
[15463]0   
[15464]0   
[15465]525    would that be drowning or cauldron or Snape"
[15466]13371  'It doesn't matter, pick any of them,' said Harry, chancing a glance behind him
[15467]7848    Professor Umbridge was now standing at Professor Trelawney's shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned Neville about his dream diary
[15468]913   What night did you dream this again
[15469]7094  ' Ron said, immersed in calculations
[15470]8841   I dunno, last night, whenever you like,' Harry told him, trying to listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney
[15471]2552    They were only a table away from him and Ron now
[15472]2985    Professor Umbridge was making another note on her clipboard and Professor Trelawney was looking extremely put out
[15473]7516   Now,' said Umbridge, looking up at Trelawney, you've been in this post how long, exactly
[15474]1061  'Professor Trelawney scowled at her, arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection
[15475]5603    After a slight pause in which she seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could reasonably ignore it, she said in a deeply resentful tone, Nearly sixteen years
[15476]6794   'Quite a period,' said Professor Umbridge, making a note on her clipboard
[15477]1574    So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you
[15478]11260  'That's right,' said Professor Trelawney shortly
[15479]1378   Professor Umbridge made another note
[15480]608   And you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney
[15481]7104  'Yes,' said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher
[15482]87   Another note on the clipboard
[15483]933   But I think- correct me if I am mistaken-that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of Second Sight
[15484]6188  'These things often skip-er-three generations,' said Professor Trelawney
[15485]6188   Professor Umbridge's toadlike smile widened
[15486]5480   Of course,' she said sweetly, making yet another note
[15487]809    Well, if you could just predict something for me, then
[15488]745  ' And she looked up enquiringly, still smiling
[15489]1061   Professor Trelawney stiffened as though unable to believe her ears
[15490]8223    I don't understand you,' she said, clutching convulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck
[15491]8039   I'd like you to make a prediction for me,' said Professor Umbridge very clearly
[15492]8330   Harry and Ron were not the only people now watching and listening sneakily from behind their books
[15493]1220    Most of the class were staring transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew herself up to her lull height, her beads and bangles clinking
[15494]251   The Inner Eye does not See upon command
[15495]5100  ' she said in scandalised tones
[15496]6647   I see,' said Professor Umbridge softly, making yet another note on her clipboard

[15499]0   
[15500]77    wait

[15526]27   There was a pause
[15527]2172    Professor Umbridge surveyed Professor Trelawney

[15532]1824   'She turned away, leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted to the spot, her chest heaving
[15533]22776    Harry caught Ron's eye and knew that Ron was thinking exactly the same as he was: they both knew that Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the other hand, they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Trelawney's side-until she swooped down on them a few seconds later, that is
[15534]0   Well
[15535]16117  ' she said, snapping her long fingers under Harry's nose, uncharacteristically brisk
[15536]1220    Let me see the start you've made on your dream diary, please
[15537]12130   'And by the time she had interpreted Harry's dreams at the top of her voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating porridge, apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), he was feeling much less sympathetic towards her
[15538]3401    All the while, Professor Umbridge stood a few feet away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first and was waiting for them all when they reached their Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson ten minutes later
[15539]594   She was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room
[15540]13908    Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell
[15541]904   Wands away,' she instructed them all with a smile, and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out, sadly returned them to their bags
[15542]1536    As we finished Chapter One last lesson, I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence Chapter Two, Common Defensive Theories and their Derivation"
[15543]303    There will be no need to talk
[15544]543   'Still smiling her wide, self-satisfied smile, she sat down at her desk
[15545]776    The class gave an audible sigh as it turned, as one, to page nineteen
[15546]8518    Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this years lessons and was on the point of checking the contents page when he noticed that Hermione had her hand in the air again
[15547]2233   Professor Umbridge had noticed, too, and what was more, she seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality
[15548]5473    Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face to face, then she bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the class could not hear, What is it this time, Miss Granger
[15549]7698  'I've already read Chapter Two,' said Hermione
[15550]180   Well then, proceed to Chapter Three
[15551]821   'I've read that too
[15552]895    I've read the whole book
[15553]1352   'Professor Umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost instantly
[15554]768   Well, then, you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says about counter-jinxes in Chapter Fifteen
[15555]6863   'He says that counter-jinxes are improperly named,' said Hermione promptly
[15556]1915    He says counter-jinx is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable
[15557]7513   'Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows and Harry knew she was impressed, against her will
[15558]1707   But I disagree,' Hermione continued
[15559]6506   Professor Umbridge's eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze became distinctly colder
[15560]4   You disagree
[15561]53  ' she repeated
[15562]8599   Yes, I do,' said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, was not whispering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted the attention of the rest of the class
[15563]372    Mr
[15564]3265    Slinkhard doesn't like jinxes, does he
[15565]658   But I think they can be very useful when they're used defensively
[15566]362   'Oh, you do, do you
[15567]6455  ' said Professor Umbridge, forgetting to whisper and straightening up
[15568]851    Well, I'm afraid it is Mr
[15569]4942    Slinkhard's opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss Granger
[15570]1736   'But-' Hermione began
[15571]6408   That is enough,' said Professor Umbridge
[15572]670    She walked back to the front of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone
[15573]1057    Miss Granger, I am going to take five points from Gryffindor house
[15574]48   'There was an outbreak of muttering at this
[15575]0   What for
[15576]10901  ' said Harry angrily
[15577]2947   Don't you get involved
[15578]1761  ' Hermione whispered urgently to him
[15579]6576   For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,' said Professor Umbridge smoothly
[15580]935    I am here to teach you using a Ministry-approved method that does not include inviting students to give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little
[15581]15341    Your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more licence, but as none of them-with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell, who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age-appropriate subjects-would have passed a Ministry inspection-'Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,' said Harry loudly, there was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head
[15582]6130   'This pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences Harry had ever heard
[15583]6096    Then-I think another week's detentions would do you some good, Mr
[15584]6121    Potter,' said Umbridge sleekly
[15585]11112   The cut on the back of Harry's hand had barely healed and, by the following morning, it was bleeding again
[15586]6826    He did not complain during the evening's detention; he was determined not to give Umbridge the satisfaction; over and over again he wrote I must not tell lies and not a sound escaped his lips, though the cut deepened with every letter
[15587]10995   The very worst part of this second week's worth of detentions v/as, just as George had predicted, Angslina's reaction
[15588]3160    She cornered him just as he arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on Tuesday and shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table
[15589]771   Miss Johnson, how dare you make such a racket in the Great Hall
[15590]242   Five points from Gryffindor
[15591]10921  'But Professor- he's gone and landed himself in detention again-'What's this, Potter
[15592]11887  ' said Professor McGonagall sharply, rounding on Harry
[15593]44    Detention
[15594]0   From whom
[15595]13499  'From Professor Umbridge,' muttered Harry, not meeting Professor McGonagall's beady, square-framed eyes
[15596]12570   Are you telling me,' she said, lowering her voice so that the group of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear, that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridge's class again
[15597]6443  'Yes,' Harry muttered, speaking to the floor
[15598]489   Potter, you must get a grip on yourself
[15599]99   You are heading for serious trouble
[15600]242   Another five points from Gryffindor
[15601]0  'But-what-
[15602]751   Professor, no
[15603]11346  ' Harry said, furious at this injustice, I'm already being punished by her, why do you have to take points as well
[15604]53  ' Because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you whatsoever
[15605]6095  ' said Professor McGonagall tartly
[15606]542    No, not another word of complaint, Potter
[15607]469   And as for you, Miss Johnson, you will confine your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team captaincy
[15608]1297  'Professor McGonagall strode back towards the staff table
[15609]8934    Angelina gave Harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away, upon which he flung himself on to the bench beside Ron, fuming
[15610]6408   She's taken points off Gryffindor because I'm having my hand sliced open every night
[15611]11   How is that fair, how
[15612]23345  'I know, mate,' said Ron sympathetically, tipping bacon on to Harry's plate, she's bang out of order
[15613]6883   'Hermione, however, merely rustled the pages of her Daily Prophet and said nothing
[15614]1374   You think McGonagall was right, do you
[15615]18067  ' said Harry angrily to the picture of Cornelius Fudge obscuring Hermione's face
[15616]21579   I wish she hadn't taken points from you, but I think she's right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge,' said Hermione's voice, while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page, clearly giving some kind of speech
[15617]8277   Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms, but when they entered Transfiguration he forgot about being cross with her
[15618]2819    Professor Umbridge and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head
[15619]2414   Excellent,' whispered Ron, as they sat down in their usual seats
[15620]5644    Let's see Umbridge get what she deserves
[15621]3162   'Professor McGonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew Professor Umbridge was there
[15622]5358   That will do,' she said and silence fell immediately
[15623]372    Mr
[15624]14852    Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the homework-Miss Brown, please take this box of mice-don't be silly, girl, they won't hurt you-and hand one to each student-'Hem, hem,' said Professor Umbridge, employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night of term
[15625]1029    Professor McGonagall ignored her
[15626]17597    Seamus handed back Harry's essay; Harry took it without looking at him and saw, to his relief, that he had managed an A'
[15627]1951   Right then, everyone, listen closely-Dean Thomas, if you do that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention-most of you have now successfully Vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have got the gist of the spell
[15628]6540    Today, we shall be-'Hem, hem,' said Professor Umbridge
[15629]292   Yes
[15630]6879  ' said Professor McGonagall, turning round, her eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long, severe line
[15631]10561   I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec-'Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom,' said Professor McGonagall, turning her back firmly on Professor Umbridge
[15632]266    Many of the students exchanged looks of glee
[15633]241    As I was saying: today, we shall be practising the altogether more difficult Vanishment of mice
[15634]150    Now, the Vanishing Spell-'Hem, hem
[15635]7977   'I wonder,' said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on Professor Umbridge, how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me
[15636]589   You see, I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking
[15637]3332   'Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face
[15638]1097    She did not speak, but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously
[15639]1775   Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more
[15640]300   As I was saying: the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be Vanished
[15641]140    The snail, as an invertebrate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a mammal, offers a much greater one
[15642]426    This is not, therefore, magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner
[15643]1096    So- you know the incantation, let me see what you can do 
[15644]0   
[15645]0   
[15646]631   'How she can lecture me about not losing my temper with Umbridge
[15647]9209  ' Harry muttered to Ron under his breath, but he was grinning-his anger with Professor McGonagall had quite evaporated
[15648]5192   Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps she realised Professor McGonagall would not permit it
[15649]3304    She did, however, take many more notes while sitting in her corner, and when Professor McGonagall finally told them all to pack away, she rose with a grim expression on her face
[15650]12513   Well, it's a start,' said Ron, holding up a long wriggling mouse-tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around
[15651]10918   As they filed out of the classroom, Harry saw Professor Umbndge approach the teachers desk; he nudged Ron, who nudged Hermione in turn, and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop
[15652]620   How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts
[15653]1678  ' Professor Umbridge asked
[15654]6475   Thirty-nine years this December,' said Professor McGonagall brusquely, snapping her bag shut
[15655]1378   Professor Umbridge made a note
[15656]5750   Very well,' she said, you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days' time
[15657]7332   'I can hardly wait,' said Professor McGonagall, in a coldly indifferent voice, and she strode off towards the door
[15658]9504    Hurry up, you three,' she added, sweeping Harry, Ron and Hermione before her
[15659]6157   Harry could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he received one in return
[15660]1719   He had thought that the next time he would see Umbridge would be in his detention that evening, but he was wrong
[15661]1456    When they walked down the lawns towards the Forest for Care of Magical Creatures, they found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside Professor Grubbly-Plank
[15662]198   You do not usually take this class, is that correct
[15663]7222  ' Harry heard her ask as they arrived at the trestle table where the group of captive Bowtruckles were scrabbling around for woodlice like so many living twigs
[15664]6562   Quite correct,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet
[15665]1622    I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor Hagrid
[15666]9473   'Harry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and Hermione
[15667]1904    Malfoy was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle; he would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry
[15668]13159   Hmm,' said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice, though Harry could still hear her quite clearly
[15669]6869    I wonder-the Headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter-can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid's very extended leave of absence
[15670]7795  'Harry saw Malfoy look up eagerly and watch Umbridge and Grubbly-Plank closely
[15671]8228   ' Fraid I can't,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank breezily
[15672]3712    Don't know anything more about it than you do
[15673]2567    Got an owl from Dumbledore, would I like a couple of weeks' teaching work
[15674]4    I accepted
[15675]5521    That's as much as I know
[15676]0    Well 
[15677]0   
[15678]0   
[15679]117    shall I get started then
[15680]6745  'Yes, please do,' said Professor Umbridge, scribbling on her clipboard
[15681]1287   Umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered amongst the students, questioning them on magical creatures
[15682]11855    Most people were able to answer well and Harry's spirits lifted somewhat; at least the class was not letting Hagrid down
[15683]12726   Overall,' said Professor Umbridge, returning to Professor Grubbly-Plank's side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, how do you, as a temporary member of staff-an objective outsider, I suppose you might say-how do you find Hogwarts
[15684]384   Do you feel you receive enough support from the school management
[15685]12185  'Oh, yes, Dumbledore's excellent,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank heartily
[15686]1400    Yes, I'm very happy with the way things are run, very happy indeed
[15687]3693   'Looking politely incredulous, Umbridge made a tiny note on her clipboard and went on, And what are you planning to cover with this class this year-assuming, of course, that Professor Hagrid does not return
[15688]7437  'Oh, I'll take them through the creatures that most often come up in OWL,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank
[15689]3244    Not much left to do-they've studied unicorns and Nifflers, I thought we'd cover Porlocks and Kneazles, make sure they can recognise Crups and Knarls, you know 
[15690]0   
[15691]0   
[15692]7519   'Well, you seem to know what you're doing, at any rate,' said Professor Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard
[15693]7297    Harry did not like the emphasis she put on you' and liked it even less when she put her next question to Goyle
[15694]346    Now, I hear there have been injuries in this class
[15695]400  'Goyle gave a stupid grin
[15696]572    Malfoy hastened to answer the question
[15697]5086   That was me,' he said
[15698]7    I was slashed by a hippogriff
[15699]6   'A hippogriff
[15700]6440  ' said Professor Umbridge, now scribbling frantically
[15701]12021   Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do,' said Harry angrily
[15702]3634   Both Ron and Hermione groaned
[15703]12794    Professor Umbridge turned her head slowly in Harry's direction
[15704]10678   Another night's detention, I think,' she said softly
[15705]6367    Well, thank you very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, I think that's all I need here
[15706]103    You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days
[15707]7862   'Jolly good,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Professor Umbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle
[15708]12234   It was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridge's office that night, his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around it
[15709]4479    He expected the common room to be empty when he returned, but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for him
[15710]1692    He was pleased to see them, especially as Hermione was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical
[15711]10620   Here,' she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid towards him, soak your hand in that, it's a solution of strained and pickled Murtlap tentacles, it should help
[15712]6411   'Harry placed his bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief
[15713]365    Crookshanks curled around his legs, purring loudly, then leapt into his lap and settled down
[15714]10644   Thanks,' he said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshanks's ears with his left hand
[15715]7769   I still reckon you should complain about this,' said Ron in a low voice
[15716]10826   No,' said Harry flatly
[15717]11718   McGonagall would go nuts if she knew-'Yeah, she probably would,' said Harry dully
[15718]1973    And how long do you reckon it'd take Umbridge to pass another decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately
[15719]2951  'Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and, after a moment, he closed it again, defeated
[15720]12214   She's an awful woman,' said Hermione in a small voice
[15721]15    Awful
[15722]3907   You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in 
[15723]0   
[15724]0   
[15725]1383    we've got to do something about her
[15726]7141   'I suggested poison,' said Ron grimly
[15727]0   No 
[15728]0   
[15729]0   
[15730]7604    I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, and how we're not going to learn any Defence from her at all,' said Hermione
[15731]0   Well, what can we do about that
[15732]7100  ' said Ron, yawning
[15733]7203    ' S too late, isn't it
[15734]10307   She's got the job, she's here to stay
[15735]1195    Fudge'll make sure of that
[15736]6713   'Well,' said Hermione tentatively
[15737]923    You know, I was thinking today 
[15738]0   
[15739]0   
[15740]13962   ' she shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on, I was thinking that- maybe the time's come when we should just-just do it ourselves
[15741]0   ' Do what ourselves
[15742]11224  ' said Harry suspiciously, still floating his hand in the essence of Murtlap tentacles
[15743]7169   Well-learn Defence Against the Dark Arts ourselves, said Hermione
[15744]2455   Come off it,' groaned Ron
[15745]462    You want us to do extra work
[15746]11412   D'you realise Harry and I are behind on homework again and it's only the second week
[15747]120  'But this is much more important than homework
[15748]6701  ' said Hermione
[15749]7740   Harry and Ron goggled at her
[15750]3392   I didn't think there was anything in the universe more important than homework
[15751]7088  ' said Ron
[15752]16874   Don't be silly, of course there is,' said Hermione, and Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervour that SPEW usually inspired in her
[15753]26525    It's about preparing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge's first lesson, for what's waiting for us out there
[15754]5381    It's about making sure we really can defend ourselves
[15755]13085    If we don't learn anything for a whole year-'We can't do much by ourselves,' said Ron in a defeated voice
[15756]10203    I mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practise them, I suppose-'No, I agree, we've gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books,' said Hermione
[15757]995    We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we're going wrong
[15758]308   'If you're talking about Lupin 
[15759]0   
[15760]0   
[15761]5853   ' Harry began
[15762]7450   No, no, I'm not talking about Lupin,' said Hermione
[15763]9835    He's too busy with the Order and, anyway, the most we could see him is during Hogsmeade weekends and that's not nearly often enough
[15764]0   'Who, then
[15765]10859  ' said Harry, frowning at her
[15766]1721   Hermione heaved a very deep sigh
[15767]2425   Isn't it obvious
[15768]5086  ' she said
[15769]6317    I'm talking about you,Harry
[15770]5097   'There was a moment's silence
[15771]2353    A light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind Ron, and the fire guttered
[15772]0   About me what
[15773]10818  ' said Harry
[15774]1055   I'm talking about you teaching us Defence Against the Dark Arts
[15775]5854   ' Harry stared at her
[15776]5021    Then he turned to Ron, ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated on far-fetched schemes like SPEW
[15777]13619    To Harry's consternation, however, Ron did not look exasperated
[15778]352   He was frowning slightly, apparently thinking
[15779]9947    Then he said, That's an idea
[15780]4861   'What's an idea
[15781]10818  ' said Harry
[15782]7088   You,' said Ron
[15783]27    Teaching us to do it
[15784]0   'But 
[15785]0   
[15786]0   
[15787]6166   'Harry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling his leg
[15788]15963   But I'm not a teacher, I can't-'Harry, you're the best in the year at Defence Against the Dark Arts,' said Hermione
[15789]0   Me
[15790]10871  ' said Harry now grinning more broadly than ever
[15791]10370    No, I'm not, you've beaten me in every test-'Actually I haven't,' said Hermione coolly
[15792]961    You beat me in our third year-the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject
[15793]6344    But I'm not talking about test results, Harry
[15794]1255    Think what you've done
[15795]852  'How d'you mean
[15796]10762  'You know what, I'm not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,' Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly
[15797]6064    He turned to Harry
[15798]12134   Let's think,' he said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating
[15799]5    Uh 
[15800]0   
[15801]0   
[15802]5842    first year-you saved the Philosopher's Stone from You-Know-Who
[15803]15853   'But that was luck,' said Harry, it wasn't skill-'Second year,' Ron interrupted, you killed the Basilisk and destroyed Riddle
[15804]22358   'Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn't turned up, I-'Third year,' said Ron, louder still, you fought off about a hundred dementors at once-'You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn't-'Last year,' Ron said, almost shouting now, you fought off You-know-Who again-'Listen to me
[15805]14541  ' said Harry, almost angrily, because Ron and Hermione were both smirking now
[15806]1440    Just listen to me, all right
[15807]23417   It sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck-I didn't know what I was doing half the time, I didn't plan any of it, I just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help-'Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt his temper rise; he wasn't even sure why he was feeling so angry
[15808]7164   Don't sit there grinning like you know better than I do, I was there, wasn't I
[15809]5092  ' he said heatedly
[15810]1526    I know what went on, all right
[15811]9828   And I didn't get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defence Against the Dark Arts, I got through it all because- because help came at the right time, or because I guessed right-but I just blundered through it all, I didn't have a clue what I was doing-STOP LAUGHING
[15812]480  'The bowl of Murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed
[15813]2964    He became aware that he was on his feet, though he couldn't remember standing up
[15814]386    Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa
[15815]8427    Ron and Hermione's smiles had vanished
[15816]9196   You don't know what it's like
[15817]1214  You-neither of you-you've never had to face him, have you
[15818]7096   You think it's just memorising a bunch of spells and throwing them at him, like you're in class or something
[15819]37499   The whole time you're sure you know there's nothing between you and dying except your own-your own brain or guts or whatever-like you can think straight when you know you're about a nanosecond from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die- they've never taught us that in their classes, what it's like to deal with things like that-and you two sit there acting like I'm a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up-you just don't get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn't needed me-'We weren't saying anything like that, mate,' said Ron, looking aghast
[15820]9677    We weren't having a go at Diggory, we didn't-you've got the wrong end of the-'He looked helplessly at Hermione, whose face was stricken

[15835]16358   'It was the first time she had ever said Voldemort's name and it was this, more than anything else, that calmed Harry
[15836]1445    Still breathing hard, he sank back into his chair, becoming aware as he did so that his hand was throbbing horribly again
[15837]91    He wished he had not smashed the bowl of Murtlap essence
[15838]0   Well 
[15839]0   
[15840]0   
[15841]7400    think about it,' said Hermione quietly
[15842]0    Please
[15843]6564  'Harry could not think of anything to say
[15844]183    He was feeling ashamed of his outburst already
[15845]136    He nodded, hardly aware of what he was agreeing to
[15846]1771   Hermione stood up
[15847]6523   Well, I'm off to bed,' she said, in a voice that was clearly as natural as she could make it

[15862]2335    Ron nodded and left
[15863]6403   Reparo,' Harry muttered, pointing his wand at the broken pieces of china
[15864]591    They flew back together, good as new, but there was no returning the Murtlap essence to the bowl
[15865]2723   He was suddenly so tired he was tempted to sink back into his armchair and sleep there, but instead he forced himself to his feet and followed Ron upstairs
[15866]1030    His restless night was punctuated once more by dreams of long corridors and locked doors and he awoke next day with his scar prickling again

[15877]8003     Hermione made no mention of Harry giving Defence Against the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original suggestion
[15878]17411    Harry's detentions with Umbridge were finally over (he doubted whether the words now etched into the back of his hand would ever fade entirely); Ron had had four more Quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two; and all three of them had managed to Vanish their mice in Transfiguration (Hermione had actually progressed to Vanishing kittens), before the subject was broached again, on a wild, blustery evening at the end of September, when the three of them were sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients for Snape
[15879]14026   I was wondering,' Hermione said suddenly, whether you'd thought any more about Defence Against the Dark Arts, Harry
[15880]18167   'Course I have,' said Harry grumpily, can't forget it, can we, with that hag teaching us-'I meant the idea Ron and I had-' Ron cast her an alarmed, threatening kind of look
[15881]1064    She frowned at him, -Oh, all right, the idea I had, then-about you teaching us
[15882]6472   'Harry did not answer at once
[15883]1504    He pretended to be perusing a page of Asiatic Anti-Venoms, because he did not want to say what was in his mind
[15884]1006   He had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight
[15885]3761    Sometimes it seemed an insane idea, just as it had on the night Hermione had proposed it, but at others, he had found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters-found himself, in fact, subconsciously planning lessons 
[15886]0   
[15887]0   
[15888]6882   Well,' he said slowly, when he could no longer pretend to find Asiatic Anti-Venoms interesting, yeah, I-I've thought about it a bit
[15889]0   'And
[15890]6752  ' said Hermione eagerly
[15891]11457   I dunno,' said Harry, playing for time
[15892]2678    He looked up at Ron
[15893]14627   I thought it was a good idea from the start,' said Ron, who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure Harry was not going to start shouting again
[15894]5866   Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair
[15895]8574   You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn't you
[15896]18393  ' Yes, Harry,' said Hermione gently, but all the same, there's no point pretending that you're not good at Defence Against the Dark Arts, because you are
[15897]11052    You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can't, Viktor always said-'Ron looked round at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck
[15898]5378    Rubbing it, he said, Yeah
[15899]940   What did Vicky say
[15900]7265  'Ho ho,' said Hermione in a bored voice
[15901]14074    He said Harry knew how to do stuff even he didn't, and he was in the final year at Durmstrang
[15902]4233   'Ron was looking at Hermione suspiciously
[15903]24   You're not still in contact with him, are you
[15904]0  'So what if I am
[15905]7583  ' said Hermione coolly, though her face was a little pink
[15906]10143    I can have a pen-pal if I-'He didn't only want to be your pen-pal,' said Ron accusingly
[15907]15677   Hermione shook her head exasperatedly and, ignoring Ron, who was continuing to watch her, said to Harry, Well, what do you think
[15908]36   Will you teach us
[15909]3087  'Just you and Ron, yeah
[15910]7341  'Well,' said Hermione, looking a mite anxious again
[15911]0    Well 
[15912]0   
[15913]0   
[15914]8730    now, don't fly off the handle again, Harry, please 
[15915]0   
[15916]0   
[15917]1011    but I really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn
[15918]615    I mean, we're talking about defending ourselves against V-Voldemort
[15919]5311    Oh, don't be pathetic, Ron
[15920]5746    It doesn't seem fair if we don't offer the chance to other people
[15921]11756   'Harry considered this for a moment, then said, Yeah, but I doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me
[15922]552    I'm a nutter, remember
[15923]9391  'Well, I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you've got to say,' said Hermione seriously
[15924]8924    Look,' she leaned towards him- Ron, who was still watching her with a frown on his face, leaned forwards to listen too-'you know the first weekend in October's a Hogsmeade weekend
[15925]5289   How would it be if we tell anyone who's interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over
[15926]353  'Why do we have to do it outside school
[15927]7088  ' said Ron
[15928]10852   Because,' said Hermione, returning to the diagram of the Chinese Chomping Cabbage she was copying, I don't think Umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to
[15929]6643   'Harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into Hogsmeade, but there was one thing worrying him
[15930]12408    Sirius had maintained a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of September; Harry knew they had made him angry by saying they didn't want him to come-but he still worried from time to time that Sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway
[15931]1915    What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street towards them in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of Draco Malfoy
[15932]16794  Well, you can't blame him for wanting to get out and about,' said Ron, when Harry discussed his fears with him and Hermione
[15933]13222    I mean, he's been on the run for over two years, hasn't he, and I know that can't have been a laugh, but at least he was free, wasn't he
[15934]6318   And now he's just shut up all the time with that ghastly elf
[15935]3786   'Hermione scowled at Ron, but otherwise ignored the slight on Kreacher
[15936]22177   The trouble is,' she said to Harry, until V-Voldemort-oh, for heaven's sake,Ron- comes out into the open, Sirius is going to have to stay hidden, isn't he
[15937]9818   I mean, the stupid Ministry isn't going to realise Sirius is innocent until they accept that Dumbledore's been telling the truth about him all along
[15938]4044    And once the fools start catching real Death Eaters again, it'll be obvious Sirius isn't one 
[15939]0   
[15940]0   
[15941]3486    I mean, he hasn't got the Mark, for one thing
[15942]10849   ' I don't reckon he'd be stupid enough to turn up,' said Ron bracingly
[15943]6814    Dumbledore'd go mad if he did and Sirius listens to Dumbledore even if he doesn't like what he hears
[15944]16734   'When Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, Listen, Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defence Against the Dark Arts, and there are a couple who seem interested
[15945]1093    We've told them to meet us in Hogsmeade
[15946]12199   'Right,' said Harry vaguely, his mind still on Sirius
[15947]15556   Don't worry, Harry,' Hermione said quietly
[15948]2061    You've got enough on your plate without Sirius, too
[15949]2266   'She was quite right, of course, he was barely keeping up with his homework, though he was doing much better now that he was no longer spending every evening in detention with Umbridge
[15950]10172    Ron was even further behind with his work than Harry, because while they both had Quidditch practice twice a week, Ron also had his prefect duties
[15951]2586    However, Hermione, who was taking more subjects than either of them, had not only finished all her homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes
[15952]6122    Harry had to admit that she was getting better; it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks
[15953]211   The morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy
[15954]829    Alter breakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village
[15955]9344    With a slight pang, Harry remembered that if it hadn't been for Sirius, he would not have been going at all
[15956]12447   When Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from Harry
[15957]6725    Then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on, out on to the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day
[15958]237   Er-why was Filch sniffing you
[15959]9974  ' asked Ron, as he, Harry and Hermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates
[15960]11138   I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,' said Harry with a small laugh
[15961]353    I forgot to tell you 
[15962]0   
[15963]0   
[15964]1221   'And he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch bursting in seconds later, demanding to see the letter
[15965]2466    To his slight surprise, Hermione found this story highly interesting, much more, indeed, than he did himself
[15966]5112   He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs
[15967]7   But who tipped him off
[15968]10877  'I dunno,' said Harry, shrugging
[15969]1749    Maybe Malfoy he'd think it was a laugh
[15970]1638   ' They walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left on to the road into the village, the wind whip-, ping their hair into their eyes
[15971]440   Malfoy
[15972]6706  ' said Hermione, sceptically
[15973]0    Well 
[15974]0   
[15975]0   
[15976]292    yes 
[15977]0   
[15978]0   
[15979]73    maybe 
[15980]0   
[15981]0   
[15982]886   'And she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of Hogsmeade
[15983]489   Where are we going, anyway
[15984]6088  ' Harry asked
[15985]22    The Three Broomsticks
[15986]12240  'Oh-no,' said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, no, it's always packed and really noisy
[15987]11892    I've told the others to meet us in the Hog's Head, that other pub, you know the one, it's not on the main road
[15988]5506    I think it's a bit 
[15989]0   
[15990]0   
[15991]771    you know 
[15992]0   
[15993]0   
[15994]6    dodgy 
[15995]0   
[15996]0   
[15997]7184    but students don't normally go in there, so I don't think we'll be overheard
[15998]7229   'They walked down the main street past Zonko's Wizarding Joke Shop, where they were not surprised to see Fred, George and Lee Jordan, past the post office, from which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up a side-street at the top of which stood a small inn
[15999]6139    A battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture on it of a wild boar's severed head, leaking blood on to the white cloth around it
[16000]123    The sign creaked in the wind as they approached
[16001]652    All three of them hesitated outside the door
[16002]7342   Well, come on,' said Hermione, slightly nervously
[16003]6333    Harry led the way inside
[16004]1272   It was not at all like the Three Broomsticks, whose large bar gave an impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness
[16005]5916    The Hog's Head bar comprised one small, dingy and very dirty room that smelled strongly of something that might have been goats
[16006]1137    The bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room, which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables
[16007]6348    The floor seemed at first glance to be compressed earth, though as Harry stepped on to it he realised that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries
[16008]22304   Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year: Yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head,' he had said, explaining how he had won a dragon's egg from a hooded stranger there
[16009]13920    At the time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog's Head
[16010]8562    There was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty grey bandages, though he was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking, fiery substance through a slit over his mouth; two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows; Harry might have thought them dementors if they had not been talking in strong Yorkshire accents, and in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick, black veil that fell to her toes
[16011]1170    They could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly
[16012]11213   I don't know about this, Hermione,' Harry muttered, as they crossed to the bar
[16013]777    He was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch
[16014]590    Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that
[16015]1828  'Hermione cast an appraising eye over the veiled figure
[16016]5859   Umbridge is shorter than that woman,' she said quietly
[16017]12697    And anyway, even if Umbridge does come in here there's nothing she can do to stop us, Harry, because I've double- and triple-checked the school rules
[16018]12525    We're not out of bounds; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog's Head, and he said yes, but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses
[16019]2123    And I've looked up everything I can think of about study groups and homework groups and they're definitely allowed
[16020]9698    I just don't think it's a good idea if we parade what we're doing
[16021]15824   'No,' said Harry drily, especially as it's not exactly a homework group you're planning, is it
[16022]454  'The barman sidled towards them out of a back room
[16023]1800    He was a grumpy-looking old man with a great deal of long grey hair and beard
[16024]6480    He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry
[16025]0   What
[16026]20  ' he grunted
[16027]6705   Three Butterbeers, please,' said Hermione
[16028]593   The man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty, very dirty bottles, which he slammed on the bar
[16029]5093   Six Sickles,' he said
[16030]11661   I'll get them,' said Harry quickly, passing over the silver
[16031]11240    The barman's eyes travelled over Harry, resting for a fraction of a second on his scar
[16032]11583    Then he turned away and deposited Harry's money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it
[16033]10318    Harry, Ron and Hermione retreated to the furthest table from the bar and sat down, looking around
[16034]304    The man in the dirty grey bandages rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman
[16035]771   You know what
[16036]2644  ' Ron murmured, looking over at the bar with enthusiasm
[16037]181    We could order anything we liked in here
[16038]2559    I bet that bloke would sell us anything, he wouldn't care
[16039]2672    I've always wanted to try Firewhisky-'You-are-a-prefect,' snarled Hermione
[16040]8078   Oh,' said Ron, the smile fading from his face
[16041]277    Yeah 
[16042]0   
[16043]0   
[16044]1097   'So, who did you say is supposed to be meeting us
[16045]6495  ' Harry asked, wrenching open the rusty top of his Butterbeer and taking a swig
[16046]4083   Just a couple of people,' Hermione repeated, checking her watch and looking anxiously towards the door
[16047]2580    I told them to be here about now and I'm sure they all know where it is-oh, look, this might be them now
[16048]680   'The door of the pub had opened
[16049]1282    A thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people
[16050]35490   First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry's stomach did a back-flip) Cho and one of her usually-giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait clown her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner and Terry Boot, Ginny, closely followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognised vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and, bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko's merchandise
[16051]368   A couple of people
[16052]12443  ' said Harry hoarsely to Hermione
[16053]368    A couple of people
[16054]7341  'Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,' said Hermione happily
[16055]2388    Ron, do you want to pull up some more chairs
[16056]870  'The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed
[16057]215    Possibly, he had never seen his pub so full
[16058]5732   Hi,' said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his companions quickly, could we have 
[16059]0   
[16060]0   
[16061]4    twenty-five Butterbeers, please
[16062]627  'The barman glared at him for a moment, then, throwing down his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very important, he started passing up dusty Butterbeers from under the bar
[16063]5547   Cheers,' said Fred, handing them out
[16064]3203    Cough up, everyone, I haven't got enough gold for all of these 
[16065]0   
[16066]0   
[16067]6898   'Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins
[16068]2890    He could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible thought occurred to him that they might be expecting same kind of speech, at which he rounded on Hermione
[16069]405   What have you been telling people
[16070]5712  ' he said in a low voice
[16071]24    What are they expecting
[16072]20863  'I've told you, they just want to hear what you've got to say,' said Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly, you don't have to do anything yet, I'll speak to them first
[16073]11427   'Hi, Harry,' said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite him
[16074]6910   Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was exceptionally dry
[16075]8435    Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron's right
[16076]8227    Her friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look which plainly told him that, given her way, she would not be here at all
[16077]10411   In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron and Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space
[16078]388    When everybody had pulled up a chair, the chatter died out
[16079]5886    Every eye was upon Harry
[16080]7640   Er,' said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves
[16081]147    Well-er-hi
[16082]6473   'The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry
[16083]0   Well 
[16084]0   
[16085]0   
[16086]13    erm 
[16087]0   
[16088]0   
[16089]771    well, you know why you're here
[16090]13    Erm 
[16091]0   
[16092]0   
[16093]32194    well, Harry here had the idea-I mean' (Harry had thrown her a sharp look) I had the idea-that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defence Against the Dark Arts-and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us- (Hermione's voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident) - because nobody could call that Defence Against the Dark Arts-' ('Hear, hear,' said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione looked heartened) -Well, I thought it would be good if we, well, took matters into our own hands
[16094]9034   'She paused, looked sideways at Harry and went on, And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just in theory but doing the real spells-'You want to pass your Defence Against the Dark Arts OWL too, though, I bet
[16095]5396  ' said Michael Corner, who was watching her closely
[16096]6918   Of course I do,' said Hermione at once
[16097]437    But more than that, I want to be properly trained in defence because 
[16098]0   
[16099]0   
[16100]0    because 
[16101]0   
[16102]0   
[16103]947   ' she took a great breath and finished, because Lord Voldemort is back
[16104]14   'The reaction was immediate and predictable
[16105]6122    Cho's friend shrieked and slopped Butterbeer down herself; Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch; Padma Patil shuddered, and Neville gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough
[16106]6466    All of them, however, looked fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry
[16107]0   Well 
[16108]0   
[16109]0   
[16110]11478    that's the plan, anyway,' said Hermione
[16111]11350    If you want to join us, we need to decide how we're going to-'Where's the proof You-Know-Who's back
[16112]5683  ' said the blond Hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice
[16113]2558   Well, Dumbledore believes it-' Hermione began
[16114]12040   You mean, Dumbledore believes him,' said the blond boy, nodding at Harry
[16115]0   Who are you
[16116]7089  ' said Ron, rather rudely
[16117]14455   Zacharias Smith,' said the boy, and I think we've got the right to know exactly what makes him say You-Know-Who's back
[16118]29640   'Look,' said Hermione, intervening swiftly, that's really not what this meeting was supposed to be about-'It's OK, Hermione,' said Harry
[16119]1128   It had just dawned on him why there were so many people there
[16120]2292    He thought Hermione should have seen this coming
[16121]11333    Some of these people-maybe even most of them-had turned up in the hopes of hearing Harry's story firsthand
[16122]5818   What makes me say You-Know-Who's back
[16123]1296  ' he repeated, looking Zacharias straight in the face
[16124]326    I saw him
[16125]7767    But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year, and if you didn't believe him, you won't believe me, and I'm not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone
[16126]5994   'The whole group seemed to have held its breath while Harry spoke
[16127]5827    Harry had the impression that even the barman was listening
[16128]266    He was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag, making it steadily dirtier
[16129]13097   Zacharias said dismissively, All Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric Diggory got killed by You-Know-Who and that you brought Diggory's body back to Hogwarts
[16130]25015    He didn't give us details, he didn't tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think we'd all like to know-'If you've come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort murders someone I can't help you,' Harry said
[16131]260    His temper, always so close to the surface these days, was rising again
[16132]7104    He did not take his eyes from Zacharias Smith's aggressive face, and was determined not to look at Cho
[16133]4008    I don't want to talk about Cedric Diggory, all right
[16134]4814   So if that's what you're here for, you might as well clear out
[16135]6957   'He cast an angry look in Hermione's direction
[16136]2595    This was, he felt, all her fault; she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just now wild his story was
[16137]6196    But none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias Smith, though he continued to gaze intently at Harry
[16138]7374   So,' said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again
[16139]0    So 
[16140]0   
[16141]0   
[16142]838    like I was saying 
[16143]0   
[16144]0   
[16145]9091    if you want to learn some defence, then we need to work out how we're going to do it, how often we're going to meet and where we're going to-'Is it true,' interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back, looking at Harry, that you can produce a Patronus
[16146]56  'There was a murmur of interest around the group at this
[16147]11265   Yeah,' said Harry slightly defensively
[16148]25   A corporeal Patronus
[16149]10534  'The phrase stirred something in Harry's memory
[16150]3975   Er-you don't know Madam Bones, do you
[16151]356  ' he asked
[16152]97   The girl smiled
[16153]9838   She's my auntie,' she said
[16154]490    I'm Susan Bones
[16155]385    She told me about your hearing
[16156]340    So-is it really true
[16157]237   You make a stag Patronus
[16158]11110  'Yes,' said Harry
[16159]5749   Blimey, Harry
[16160]5770  ' said Lee, looking deeply impressed
[16161]278    I never knew that
[16162]13713  ' Mum told Ron not to spread it around,' said Fred, grinning at Harry
[16163]5816    She said you got enough attention as it was
[16164]11003   'She's not wrong,' mumbled Harry, and a couple of people laughed
[16165]449   The veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat
[16166]6529   And did you kill a Basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore's office
[16167]43  ' demanded Terry Boot
[16168]5419    That's what one of the portraits on the wall told me when I was in there last year 
[16169]0   
[16170]0   
[16171]12160   'Er-yeah, I did, yeah,' said Harry
[16172]5377   Justin Finch-Fletchley whistled; the Creevey brothers exchanged awestruck looks and Lavender Brown said Wow
[16173]46  ' softly
[16174]6872    Harry was feeling slightly hot around the collar now; he was determinedly looking anywhere but at Cho
[16175]12366   And in our first year,' said Neville to the group at large, he saved that Philological Stone- 'Philosopher's,' hissed Hermione
[16176]1439   Yes, that-from You-Know-Who,' finished Neville
[16177]646   Hannah Abbotts eyes were as round as Galleons
[16178]23048   And that's not to mention,' said Cho (Harry's eyes snapped across to her; she was looking at him, smiling; his stomach did another somersault) all the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last year-getting past dragons and merpeople and Acromantula and things 
[16179]0   
[16180]0   
[16181]237   'There was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table
[16182]10507    Harry's insides were squirming
[16183]1938    He was trying to arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased with himself
[16184]1859    The fact that Cho had just praised him made it much, much harder for him to say the thing he had sworn to himself he would tell them
[16185]5743   Look,' he said, and everyone fell silent at once, I 
[16186]0   
[16187]0   
[16188]4789    I don't want to sound like I'm trying to be modest or anything, but 
[16189]0   
[16190]0   
[16191]306    I had a lot of help with all that stuff 
[16192]0   
[16193]0   
[16194]7932   'Not with the dragon, you didn't,' said Michael Corner at once
[16195]337    That was a seriously cool bit of flying 
[16196]0   
[16197]0   
[16198]11268   'Yeah, well-' said Harry, feeling it would be churlish to disagree
[16199]5332   And nobody helped you get rid of those dementors this summer,' said Susan Bones
[16200]13806   No,' said Harry, no, OK, I know I did bits of it without help, but the point I'm trying to make is-'Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff
[16201]5131  ' said Zacharias Smith
[16202]21121   Here's an idea,' said Ron loudly, before Harry could speak, why don't you shut your mouth
[16203]2131  'Perhaps the word weasel' had affected Ron particularly strongly
[16204]1610    In any case, he was now looking at Zacharias as though he would like nothing better than to thump him
[16205]33    Zacharias flushed
[16206]13575   Well, we've all turned up to learn from him and now he's telling us he can't really do any of it,' he said
[16207]10301   That's not what he said,' snarled Fred
[16208]847   Would you like us to clean out your ears for you
[16209]6028  ' enquired Greorge, pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from inside one of the Zonko's bags
[16210]5889   Or any part of your body, really, we're not fussy where we stick this,' said Fred
[16211]7131   Yes, well,' said Hermione hastily, moving on 
[16212]0   
[16213]0   
[16214]6229   'the point is, are we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry
[16215]27  'There was a murmur of general agreement
[16216]10979    Zacharias folded his arms and said nothing, though perhaps this was because he was too busy keeping an eye on the instrument in Fred's hand
[16217]7906   Right,' said Hermione, looking relieved that something had at last been settled
[16218]52    Well, then, the next question is how often we do it
[16219]17159    I really don't think there's any point in meeting less than once a week-'Hang on,' said Angelina, we need to make sure this doesn't clash with our Quidditch practice
[16220]5236   'No,' said Cho, nor with ours
[16221]139   'Nor ours,' added Zacharias Smith
[16222]19086   I'm sure we can find a night that suits everyone,' said Hermione, slightly impatiently, but you know, this is rather important, we're talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort's Death Eaters-'Well said
[16223]6284  ' barked Ernie Macmillan, who Harry had been expecting to speak long before this
[16224]1897    Personally, I think this is really important, possibly more important than anything else we'll do this year, even with our OWLs coming up
[16225]1103  ' He looked around impressively, as though waiting for people to cry Surely not
[16226]596  ' When nobody spoke, he went on, I, personally, am at a loss to see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher on us at this critical period
[16227]17811    Obviously, they are in denial about the return of You-Know-Who, but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells-' We think the reason Umbridge doesn't want us trained in Defence Against the Dark Arts,' said Hermione, is that she's got some 
[16228]0   
[16229]0   
[16230]1607    some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army
[16231]893    She thinks he'd mobilise us against the Ministry
[16232]1192   'Nearly everybody looked stunned at this news; everybody except Luna Lovegood, who piped up, Well, that makes sense
[16233]956    After all, Cornelius Fudge has got his own private army
[16234]0   'What
[16235]10989  ' said Harry, completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information
[16236]10981   Yes, he's got an army of Heliopaths,' said Luna solemnly
[16237]4029   No, he hasn't,' snapped Hermione
[16238]5522   Yes, he has,' said Luna
[16239]2   What are Heliopaths
[16240]1300  ' asked Neville, looking blank
[16241]16852   They're spirits of fire,' said Luna, her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever, great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of-'They don't exist, Neville,' said Hermione tartly
[16242]654   Oh, yes, they do
[16243]5313  ' said Luna angrily
[16244]5299   I'm sorry, but where's the proof of that
[16245]1666  ' snapped Hermione
[16246]187   There are plenty of eye-witness accounts
[16247]9351    Just because you're so narrow-minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you-' Hem, hem,' said Ginny, in such a good imitation of Professor Umbridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed
[16248]3279    Weren't we trying to decide how often we're going to meet and have defence lessons
[16249]8178  'Yes,' said Hermione at once, yes, we were, you're right, Ginny
[16250]5267   'Well, once a week sounds cool,' said Lee Jordan
[16251]561   As long as-' began Angelina
[16252]8755   Yes, yes, we know about the Quidditch,' said Hermione in a tense voice
[16253]748    Well, the other thing to decide is where we're going to meet 
[16254]0   
[16255]0   
[16256]297   'This was rather more difficult; the whole group fell silent
[16257]33   Library
[16258]134  ' suggested Katie Bell after a few moments
[16259]13469   I can't see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library,' said Harry
[16260]120   Maybe an unused classroom
[16261]5154  ' said Dean
[16262]14501   Yeah,' said Ron, McGonagall might let us have hers, she did when Harry was practising for the Tri wizard
[16263]6603   'But Harry was pretty certain that McGonagall would not be so accommodating this time
[16264]7138    For all that Hermione had said about study and homework groups being allowed, he had the distinct feeling that this one might be considered a lot more rebellious
[16265]7911   Right, well, we'll try to find somewhere,' said Hermione
[16266]2976    We'll send a message round to everybody when we've got a time and a place for the first meeting
[16267]569   'She rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill, then hesitated, rather as though she was steeling herself to say something
[16268]2220   I-I think everybody should write their name down, just so we know who was here
[16269]1207    But I also think,' she took a deep breath, that we all ought to agree not to shout about what we're doing
[16270]995    So if you sign, you're agreeing not to tell Umbridge or anybody else what we're up to
[16271]7667   'Fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully wrote his signature, but Harry noticed at once that several people looked less than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list
[16272]121   Er 
[16273]0   
[16274]0   
[16275]6118   ' said Zacharias slowly, not taking the parchment that George was trying to pass to him, well 
[16276]0   
[16277]0   
[16278]1136    I'm sure Ernie will tell me when the meeting is
[16279]680   'But Ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing, too
[16280]1782    Hermione raised her eyebrows at him
[16281]156   I-well, we are prefects,' Ernie burst out
[16282]30    And if this list was found 
[16283]0   
[16284]0   
[16285]501    well, I mean to say 
[16286]0   
[16287]0   
[16288]18390    you said yourself, if Umbridge finds out-'You just said this group was the most important thing you'd do this year,' Harry reminded him
[16289]13171   I-yes,' said Ernie, yes, I do believe that, it's just-'Ernie, do you really think I'd leave that list lying around
[16290]6706  ' said Hermione testily
[16291]0   No
[16292]6174    No, of course not,' said Ernie, looking slightly less anxious
[16293]1143    I-yes, of course I'll sign
[16294]11682   'Nobody raised objections after Ernie, though Harry saw Cho's friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her own name
[16295]2247    When the last person-Zacharias- had signed, Hermione took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag
[16296]273    There was an odd feeling in the group now
[16297]925    It was as though they had just signed some kind of contract
[16298]11201   Well, time's ticking on,' said Fred briskly, getting to his feet
[16299]1856    George, Lee and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase, we'll be seeing you all later
[16300]497   'In twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave, too
[16301]2785   Cho made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving, her long dark curtain of hair swinging forwards to hide her face, but her friend stood beside her, arms folded, clicking her tongue, so that Cho had little choice but to leave with her
[16302]7150    As her friend ushered her through the door, Cho looked back and waved at Harry
[16303]21069   Well, I think that went quite well,' said Hermione happily, as she, Harry and Ron walked out of the Hog's Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later
[16304]7807    Harry and Ron were clutching their bottles of Butterbeer
[16305]12764   That Zacharias bloke's a wart,' said Ron, who was glowering after the figure of Smith, just discernible in the distance
[16306]6474   I don't like him much, either,' admitted Hermione, but he overheard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming, so what could I say
[16307]9383   But the more people the better really-I mean, Michael Corner and his friends wouldn't have come if he hadn't been going out with Ginny-'Ron, who had been draining the last few drops from his Butterbeer bottle, gagged and sprayed Butterbeer down his front
[16308]4750   He's WHAT
[16309]2117  ' spluttered Ron, outraged, his ears now resembling curls of raw beef
[16310]11456    She's going out with-my sister's going-what d'you mean, Michael Corner
[16311]10653  'Well, that's why he and his friends came, I think-well, they're obviously interested in learning defence, but if Ginny hadn't told Michael what was going on-'When did this- when did she-
[16312]7884  'They met at the Yule Ball and got together at the end of last year,' said Hermione composedly
[16313]5702    They had turned into the High Street and she paused outside Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop, where there was a handsome display of pheasant feather quills in the window
[16314]4    Hmm 
[16315]0   
[16316]0   
[16317]206    I could do with a new quill
[16318]366   ' She turned into the shop
[16319]7855    Harry and Ron followed her
[16320]112   Which one was Michael Corner
[16321]2080  ' Ron demanded furiously
[16322]7011   The dark one,' said Hermione
[16323]10530   I didn't like him,' said Ron at once
[16324]6887   Big surprise,' said Hermione under her breath
[16325]15280   But,' said Ron, following Hermione along a row of quills in copper pots, I thought Ginny fancied Harry
[16326]2848  'Hermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head
[16327]6501   Ginny used to fancy Harry, but she gave up on him months ago
[16328]9934    Not that she doesn't like you, of course,' she added kindly to Harry while she examined a long black and gold quill
[16329]15180   Harry, whose head was still full of Cho's parting wave, did not find this subject quite as interesting as Ron, who was positively quivering with indignation, but it did bring something home to him that until now he had not really registered
[16330]4754   So that's why she talks now
[16331]1971  ' he asked Hermione
[16332]190    She never used to talk in front of me
[16333]6802   'Exactly,' said Hermione
[16334]1421    Yes, I think I'll have this one 
[16335]0   
[16336]0   
[16337]2365   'She went up to the counter and handed over fifteen Sickles and two Knuts, with Ron still breathing down her neck
[16338]16539   Ron,' she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet, this is exactly why Ginny hasn't told you she's seeing Michael, she knew you'd take it badly
[16339]7716    So don't harp on about it, for heaven's sake
[16340]852   'What d'you mean
[16341]4909   Who's taking anything badly
[16342]933   I'm not going to harp on about anything 
[16343]0   
[16344]0   
[16345]2573   ' Ron continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the street
[16346]15604   Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry and then said in an undertone, while Ron was still muttering imprecations about Michael Corner, And talking about Michael and Ginny 
[16347]0   
[16348]0   
[16349]150    what about Cho and you
[16350]852  'What d'you mean
[16351]10973  ' said Harry quickly
[16352]1012   It was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him; a burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the cold-had he been that obvious
[16353]10656  Well,' said Hermione, smiling slightly, she just couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she
[16354]6588  'Harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of Hogsmeade was

[16371]6187     Harry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done all term
[16372]3936    He and Ron spent much of Sunday catching up with all their homework again, and although this could hardly be called fun, the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so rather than sitting hunched over tables in the common room they took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of the lake
[16373]2245    Hermione, who of course was up to date with all her work, brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting needles so that they flashed and clicked in midair beside her, producing more hats and scarves
[16374]7167   Knowing they were doing something to resist Umbridge and the Ministry and that he was a key part of the rebellion, gave Harry a feeling of immense satisfaction
[16375]1220    He kept reliving Saturdays meeting in his mind: all those people, coming to him to learn Defence Against the Dark Arts 
[16376]0   
[16377]0   
[16378]537    and the looks on their faces as they had heard some of the things he had done 
[16379]0   
[16380]0   
[16381]2033    and Cho praising his performance in the Triwizard Tournament-knowing all those people did not think him a lying weirdo, but someone to be admired, buoyed him up so much that he was still cheerful on Monday morning, despite the imminent prospect of all his least favourite classes
[16382]9978   He and Ron headed downstairs from their dormitory, discussing Angelina's idea that they were to work on a new move called the Sloth Grip Roll during that nights Quidditch practice, and not until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they notice the addition to the room that had already attracted the attention of a small group of people
[16383]1478   A large sign had been affixed to the Grffindor noticeboard, so large it covered everything else on it-the lists of secondhand spellbooks for sale, the regular reminders of school rules from Argus Filch, the Quidditch team training timetable, the offers to barter certain Chocolate Frog Cards for others, the Weasleys' latest advertisement for testers, the dates of the Hogsmeade weekends and the lost and found notices
[16384]1377    The new sign was printed in large black letters and there was a highly official-looking seal at the bottom beside a neat and curly signature
[16385]353   BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTSAll student organisations, societies, teams, groups and clubs arehenceforth disbanded
[16386]393    An organisation, society, team, group or club is hereby definedas a regular meeting of three or more students
[16387]1507    Permission to re-form may be sought from the High Inquisitor(Professor Umbridge)
[16388]356    No student organisation, society, team, group or club may existwithout the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor
[16389]400    Any student found to have formed, or to belong to, an organisation,society, team, group or club that has not been approved bythe High Inquisitor will be expelled
[16390]22    The above is in accordance with Educational DecreeNumber Twenty-four
[16391]3947    Signed: Dolores Jane Umbridge, High InquisitorHarry and Ron read the notice over the heads of some anxious-looking second-years
[16392]933   Does this mean they're going to shut down the Gobstones Club
[16393]417  ' one of them asked his friend
[16394]8279   I reckon you'll be OK with Gobstones,' Ron said darkly, making the second-year jump
[16395]4016    I don't think we're going to be as lucky, though, do you
[16396]6835  ' he asked Harry as the second-years hurried away
[16397]5819   Harry was reading the notice through again
[16398]193    The happiness that had filled him since Saturday was gone
[16399]53    His insides were pulsing with rage
[16400]7708   This isn't a coincidence,' he said, his hands forming fists
[16401]65    She knows
[16402]9396   ' She can't,' said Ron at once
[16403]384   There were people listening in that pub
[16404]9962    And let's face it, we don't know how many of the people who turned up we can trust 
[16405]0   
[16406]0   
[16407]963    any of them could have run off and told Umbridge 
[16408]0   
[16409]0   
[16410]801   'And he had thought they believed him, thought they even admired him 
[16411]0   
[16412]0   
[16413]45   Zacharias Smith
[16414]7469  ' said Ron at once, punching a fist into his hand
[16415]7826    Or-I thought that Michael Corner had a really shifty look, too-'I wonder if Hermione's seen this yet
[16416]12102  ' Harry said, looking round at the door to the girls' dormitories
[16417]12490   Let's go and tell her,' said Ron
[16418]1184    He bounded forwards, pulled open the door and set off up the spiral staircase
[16419]2448   He was on the sixth stair when there was a loud, wailing, klaxon-like sound and the steps melted together to make a long, smooth stone slide like a helter-skelter
[16420]14384    There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep running, arms working madly like windmills, then he toppled over backwards and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on his back at Harry's feet
[16421]17150   Er-I don't think we're allowed in the girls' dormitories,' said Harry, pulling Ron to his feet and trying not to laugh
[16422]604   Two fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide
[16423]7   Oooh
[16424]170    who tried to get upstairs
[16425]8040  ' they giggled happily, leaping to their feet and ogling Harry and Ron
[16426]7093   Me,' said Ron, who was still rather dishevelled
[16427]2778    I didn't realise that would happen
[16428]4761    It's not fair
[16429]6006  ' he added to Harry, as the girls headed off for the portrait hole, still giggling madly
[16430]6944    Hermione's allowed in our dormitory, how come we're not allowed -
[16431]13698  'Well, it's an old-fashioned rule,' said Hermione, who had just slid neatly on to a rug in front of them and was now getting to her feet, but it says in Hogwarts: A History, that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls
[16432]233    Anyway, why were you trying to get in there
[16433]457  'To see you-look at this
[16434]7112  ' said Ron, dragging her over to the noticeboard
[16435]6949   Hermione's eyes slid rapidly down the notice
[16436]71    Her expression became stony
[16437]1   Someone must have blabbed to her
[16438]7171  ' Ron said angrily
[16439]9635   They can't have done,' said Hermione in a low voice
[16440]17712   You're so naive,' said Ron, you think just because you're all honourable and trustworthy -'No, they can't have done, because I put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed,' said Hermione grimly
[16441]7552    Believe me, if anyone's run off and told Umbridge, we'll know exactly who they are and they will really regret it
[16442]614   'What'll happen to them
[16443]7139  ' said Ron eagerly
[16444]13834   Well, put it this way,' said Hermione, it'll make Eloise Midgeon's acne look like a couple of cute freckles
[16445]6115    Come on, let's get down to breakfast and see what the others think 
[16446]0   
[16447]0   
[16448]52    I wonder whether this has been put up in all the houses
[16449]6228  'It was immediately apparent on entering the Great Hall that Umbridge's sign had not only appeared in Gryffindor Tower
[16450]749    There was a peculiar intensity about the chatter and an extra measure of movement in the Hall as people scurried up and down their tables conferring on what they had read
[16451]11050    Harry, Ron and Hermione had barely taken their seats when Neville, Dean, Fred, George and Ginny descended upon them
[16452]667   Did you see it
[16453]736  'D'you reckon she knows
[16454]489  'What are we going to do
[16455]6337  'They were all looking at Harry
[16456]592    He glanced around to make sure there were no teachers near them
[16457]5929   We're going to do it anyway, of course,' he said quietly
[16458]12525   Knew you'd say that,' said George, beaming and thumping Harry on the arm
[16459]16   The prefects as well
[16460]9737  ' said Fred, looking quizzically at Ron and Hermione
[16461]6944   Of course,' said Hermione coolly
[16462]8336   Here come Ernie and Hannah Abbott,' said Ron, looking over his shoulder
[16463]57    And those Ravenclaw blokes and Smith 
[16464]0   
[16465]0   
[16466]89    and no one looks very spotty
[16467]2309   'Hermione looked alarmed
[16468]4280   Never mind spots, the idiots can't come over here now, it'll look really suspicious-sit down
[16469]369  ' she mouthed to Ernie and Hannah, gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the Hufflepuff table
[16470]125    Later
[16471]812   We'll-talk-to-you-later
[16472]6450  'I'll tell Michael,' said Ginny impatiently, swinging herself off her bench, the fool, honestly 
[16473]0   
[16474]0   
[16475]6135   'She hurried off towards the Ravenclaw table; Harry watched her go
[16476]6304    Cho was sitting not far away, talking to the curly-haired friend she had brought along to the Hog's Head
[16477]5424    Would Umbridge's notice scare her off meeting them again
[16478]1108   But the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until they were leaving the Great Hall for History of Magic
[16479]5732   Harry
[16480]2002   Ron
[16481]776  'It was Angelina and she was hurrying towards them looking perfectly desperate
[16482]16022   It's OK,' said Harry quietly, when she was near enough to hear him
[16483]5425    We're still going to-'You realise she's including Quidditch in this
[16484]5173  ' Angelina said over him
[16485]436    We have to go and ask permission to re-form the Gryffindor team
[16486]0  'What
[16487]10818  ' said Harry
[16488]7451   No way,' said Ron, appalled
[16489]208   You read the sign, it mentions teams too
[16490]5807   So listen, Harry 
[16491]0   
[16492]0   
[16493]660    I am saying this for the last time 
[16494]0   
[16495]0   
[16496]3901    please, please don't lose your temper with Umbridge again or she might not let us play any more
[16497]11791  'OK, OK,' said Harry, for Angelina looked as though she was on the verge of tears
[16498]3558    Don't worry, I'll behave myself 
[16499]0   
[16500]0   
[16501]12947   'Bet Umbridge is in History of Magic,' said Ron grimly, as they set off for Binns's lesson
[16502]2401    She hasn't inspected Binns yet 
[16503]0   
[16504]0   
[16505]4791    bet you anything she's there 
[16506]0   
[16507]0   
[16508]1377   'But he was wrong; the only teacher present when they entered was Professor Binns, floating an inch or so above his chair as usual and preparing to continue his monotonous drone on giant wars
[16509]13772    Harry did not even attempt to follow what he was saying today; he doodled idly on his parchment ignoring Hermione's frequent glares and nudges, until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made him look up angrily
[16510]0   What
[16511]244  'She pointed at the window
[16512]6533    Harry looked round
[16513]567    Hedwig was perched on the narrow window ledge, gazing through the thick glass at him, a letter tied to her leg
[16514]9308    Harry could not understand it; they had just had breakfast, why on earth hadn't she delivered the letter then, as usual
[16515]185   Many of his classmates were pointing out Hedwig to each other, too
[16516]12019   Oh, I've always loved that owl, she's so beautiful,' Harry heard Lavender sigh to Parvati
[16517]6272   He glanced round at Professor Binns who continued to read his notes, serenely unaware that the class's attention was even less focused upon him than usual
[16518]6707    Harry slipped quietly off his chair, crouched down and hurried along the row to the window, where he slid the catch and opened it very slowly
[16519]1315   He had expected Hedwig to hold out her leg so that he could remove the letter and then fly off to the Owlery, but the moment the window was open wide enough she hopped inside, hooting dolefully
[16520]1490    He closed the window with an anxious glance at Professor Binns, crouched low again and sped back to his seat with Hedwig on his shoulder
[16521]313    He regained his seat, transferred Hedwig to his lap and made to remove the letter tied to her leg
[16522]6224   Only then did he realise that Hedwig's feathers were oddly ruffled; some were bent the wrong way, and she was holding one of her wings at an odd angle
[16523]4811   She's hurt
[16524]6446  ' Harry whispered, bending his head low over her
[16525]5370    Hermione and Ron leaned in closer; Hermione even put down her quill
[16526]12055    Look-there's something wrong with her wing-'Hedwig was quivering; when Harry made to touch the wing she gave a little jump, all her feathers on end as though she was inflating herself, and gazed at him reproachfully
[16527]12672   Professor Binns,' said Harry loudly, and everyone in the class turned to look at him
[16528]609    I'm not feeling well
[16529]2792   'Professor Binns raised his eyes from his notes, looking amazed, as always, to find the room in front of him full of people
[16530]168   Not feeling well
[16531]54  ' he repeated hazily
[16532]11316   Not at all well,' said Harry firmly, getting to his feet with Hedwig concealed behind his back
[16533]854    I think I need to go to the hospital wing
[16534]6318   'Yes,' said Professor Binns, clearly very much wrong-footed
[16535]292    Yes 
[16536]0   
[16537]0   
[16538]401    yes, hospital wing 
[16539]0   
[16540]0   
[16541]7    well, off you go, then, Perkins 
[16542]0   
[16543]0   
[16544]12713   'Once outside the room, Harry returned Hedwig to his shoulder and hurried off up the corridor, pausing to think only when he was out of sight of Binns's door
[16545]2859    His first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig would have been Hagrid, of course, but as he had no idea where Hagrid was his only remaining option was to find Professor Grubbly-Plank and hope she would help
[16546]237   He peered out of a window at the blustery, overcast grounds
[16547]6133    There was no sign of her anywhere near Hagrid's cabin; if she was not teaching, she was probably in the staff room
[16548]395    He set off downstairs, Hedwig hooting feebly as she swayed on his shoulder
[16549]1100   Two stone gargoyles flanked the staff-room door
[16550]5918    As Harry approached, one of them croaked, You should be in class, Sonny Jim
[16551]10841   'This is urgent,' said Harry curtly
[16552]13   Ooooh, urgent, is it
[16553]5771  ' said the other gargoyle in a high-pitched voice
[16554]7296    Well, that's put us in our place, hasn't it
[16555]5773  'Harry knocked
[16556]3034    He heard footsteps, then the door opened and he found himself face to face with Professor McGonagall
[16557]2560   You haven't been given another detention
[16558]5132  ' she said at once, her square spectacles flashing alarmingly
[16559]751   No, Professor
[16560]10860  ' said Harry hastily
[16561]144   Well then, why are you out of class
[16562]10080  'It's urgent, apparently,' said the second gargoyle snidely
[16563]7631   I'm looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank,' Harry explained
[16564]9618    It's my owl, she's injured
[16565]1055   'Injured owl, did you say
[16566]7042  'Professor Grubbly-Plank appeared at Professor McGonagall's shoulder, smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the Daily Prophet
[16567]25198   Yes,' said Harry, lifting Hedwig carefully off his shoulder, she turned up after the other post owls and her wing's all funny, look-'Professor Grubbly-Plank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth and took Hedwig from Harry while Professor McGonagall watched
[16568]6117   Hmm,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank, her pipe waggling slightly as she talked
[16569]5630    Looks like something's attacked her
[16570]2870    Can't think what would have done it, though
[16571]6718    Thestrals will sometimes go for birds, of course, but Hagrid's got the Hogwarts Thestrals well-trained not to touch owls
[16572]8931   'Harry neither knew nor cared what Thestrals were; he just wanted to know that Hedwig was going to be all right
[16573]18790    Professor McGonagall, however, looked sharply at Harry and said, Do you know how far this owl's travelled, Potter
[16574]10939  'Er,' said Harry
[16575]583    From London, I think
[16576]1895   'He met her eyes briefly and knew, by the way her eyebrows had joined in the middle, that she understood London' to mean number twelve, Grimmauld Place'
[16577]6491   Professor Grubbly-Plank pulled a monocle out of the inside of her robes and screwed it into her eye, to examine Hedwig's wing closely
[16578]8757    I should be able to sort this out if you leave her with me, Potter,' she said, she shouldn't be flying long distances for a few days, in any case
[16579]12478   'Er-right-thanks,' said Harry, just as the bell rang for break
[16580]6531   No problem,' said Professor Grubbly-Plank gruffly, turning back into the staff room
[16581]1074   Just a moment, Wilhelmina
[16582]6092  ' said Professor McGonagall
[16583]5299    Potter's letter
[16584]639  ' Oh yeah
[16585]15752  ' said Harry, who had momentarily forgotten the scroll tied to Hedwig's leg
[16586]8656    Professor Grubbly-Plank handed it over and then disappeared into the staff room carrying Hedwig, who was staring at Harry as though unable to believe he would give her away like this
[16587]1811    Feeling slightly guilty, he turned to go, but Professor McGonagall called him back
[16588]461   Potter
[16589]1043  'Yes, Professor
[16590]447  'She glanced up and down the corridor; there were students coming from both directions
[16591]9168   Bear in mind,' she said quickly and quietly, her eyes on the scroll in his hand, that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts may be being watched, won't you
[16592]11110  'I-' said Harry, but the flood of students rolling along the corridor was almost upon him
[16593]7686    Professor McGonagall gave him a curt nod and retreated into the staff room, leaving Harry to be swept out into the courtyard with the crowd
[16594]4331    He spotted Ron and Hermione already standing in a sheltered corner, their cloak collars turned up against the wind
[16595]12385    Harry slit open the scroll as he hurried towards them and found five words in Sirius's handwriting:Today, same time, same place
[16596]166   Is Hedwig OK
[16597]2277  ' asked Hermione anxiously, the moment he was within earshot
[16598]667   Where did you take her
[16599]2358  ' asked Ron
[16600]10899   To Grubbly-Plank,' said Harry
[16601]319    And I met McGonagall 
[16602]0   
[16603]0   
[16604]75    listen 
[16605]0   
[16606]0   
[16607]6414   'And he told them what Professor McGonagall had said
[16608]744    To his surprise, neither of the others looked shocked
[16609]132    On the contrary, they exchanged significant looks
[16610]0   What
[16611]15040  ' said Harry, looking from Ron to Hermione and back again
[16612]2914   Well, I was just saying to Ron 
[16613]0   
[16614]0   
[16615]213    what if someone had tried to intercept Hedwig
[16616]5060   I mean, she's never been hurt on a flight before, has she
[16617]4838  'Who's the letter from, anyway
[16618]8271  ' asked Ron, taking the note from Harry
[16619]10963   Snuffles,' said Harry quietly
[16620]739   "Same time, same place
[16621]865   Does he mean the fire in the common room
[16622]6857  'Obviously,' said Hermione, also reading the note
[16623]686    She looked uneasy
[16624]999    I just hope nobody else has read this 
[16625]0   
[16626]0   
[16627]11070   'But it was still sealed and everything,' said Harry, trying to convince himself as much as her
[16628]4252    And nobody would understand what it meant if they didn't know where we'd spoken to him before, would they
[16629]13531  'I don't know,' said Hermione anxiously, hitching her bag back over her shoulder as the bell rang again, it wouldn't be exactly difficult to re-seal the scroll by magic 
[16630]0   
[16631]0   
[16632]4920    and if anyone's watching the Floo Network 
[16633]0   
[16634]0   
[16635]3680    but I don't really see how we can warn him not to come without that being intercepted, too
[16636]10065  'They trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for Potions, all three of them, lost in thought, but as they reached the bottom of the steps they were recalled to themselves by the voice of Draco Malfoy, who was standing just outside Snape's classroom door, waving around an official-looking piece of parchment and talking much louder than was necessary so that they could hear every word
[16637]2137   Yeah, Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to continue playing straightaway, I went to ask her first thing this morning
[16638]5696    Well, it was pretty much automatic, I mean, she knows my father really well, he's always popping in and out of the Ministry 
[16639]0   
[16640]0   
[16641]3314    it'll be interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing, won't it
[16642]13231  'Don't rise,' Hermione whispered imploringly to Harry and Ron, who were both watching Malfoy, faces set and fists clenched
[16643]4788    It's what he wants
[16644]29655   'I mean,' said Malfoy, raising his voice a little more, his grey eyes glittering malevolently in Harry and Ron's direction, if it's a question of influence with the Ministry, I don't think they've got much chance 
[16645]0   
[16646]0   
[16647]2383    from what my father says, they've been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years 
[16648]0   
[16649]0   
[16650]461    and as for Potter 
[16651]0   
[16652]0   
[16653]5834    my father says it's a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St
[16654]4785    Mungo's 
[16655]0   
[16656]0   
[16657]2038    apparently they've got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic
[16658]1897   'Malfoy made a grotesque face, his mouth sagging open and his eyes rolling
[16659]610    Crabbe and Goyle gave their usual grunts of laughter; Pansy Parkinson shrieked with glee
[16660]10842   Something collided hard with Harry's shoulder, knocking him sideways
[16661]2204    A split second later he realised that Neville had just charged past him, heading straight for Malfoy
[16662]306   Neville, no
[16663]13181  'Harry leapt forward and seized the back of Neville's robes; Neville struggled frantically, his fists flailing, trying desperately to get at Malfoy who looked, for a moment, extremely shocked
[16664]145   Help me
[16665]13445  ' Harry flung at Ron, managing to get an arm around Neville's neck and dragging him backwards, away from the Slytherins
[16666]849    Crabbe and Goyle were flexing their arms as they stepped in front of Malfoy, ready for the fight
[16667]13495    Ron seized Neville's arms, and together he and Harry succeeded in dragging Neville back into the Gryffindor line
[16668]6879    Nevilles face was scarlet; the pressure Harry was exerting on his throat rendered him quite incomprehensible, but odd words spluttered from his mouth

[16687]699   'The dungeon door opened
[16688]572    Snape appeared there
[16689]9126    His black eyes swept up the Gryffindor line to the point where Harry and Ron were wrestling with Neville
[16690]1155   Fighting, Potter, Weasley, Longbottom
[16691]6220  ' Snape said in his cold, sneering voice
[16692]242    Ten points from Gryffindor
[16693]549    Release Longbottom, Potter, or it will be detention
[16694]198    Inside, all of you
[16695]6560   'Harry let go of Neville, who stood panting and glaring at him
[16696]6001   I had to stop you,' Harry gasped, picking up his bag
[16697]888    Crabbe and Goyle would've torn you apart
[16698]5567   'Neville said nothing; he merely snatched up his own bag and stalked off into the dungeon
[16699]7654   What in the name of Merlin,' said Ron slowly, as they followed Neville, was that about
[16700]6472  'Harry did not answer
[16701]779    He knew exactly why the subject of people who were in St
[16702]11517    Mungo's because of magical damage to their brains was highly distressing to Neville, but he had sworn to Dumbledore that he would not tell anyone Neville's secret
[16703]7754    Even Neville did not know Harry knew
[16704]10270   Harry, Ron and Hermione took their usual seats at the back of the class, pulled out parchment, quills and their copies of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi
[16705]2732   The class around them was whispering about what Neville had just done, but when Snape closed the dungeon door with an echoing bang, everybody immediately fell silent
[16706]6302   You will notice,' said Snape, in his low, sneering voice, that we have a guest with us today
[16707]7690   'He gestured towards the dim corner of the dungeon and Harry saw Professor Umbridge sitting there, clipboard on her knee
[16708]3892    He glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione, his eyebrows raised
[16709]1119    Snape and Umbridge, the two teachers he hated most
[16710]374    It was hard to decide which one he wanted to triumph over the other
[16711]95   We are continuing with our Strengthening Solution today
[16712]835    You will find your mixtures as you left them last lesson; it correctly made they should have matured well over the weekend-instructions-' he waved his wand again -on the board
[16713]21    Carry on
[16714]1914   'Professor Umbridge spent the first half hour of the lesson making notes in her corner
[16715]6442    Harry was very interested in hearing her question Snape; so interested, that he was becoming careless with his potion again
[16716]5834   Salamander blood, Harry
[16717]2321  ' Hermione moaned, grabbing his wrist to prevent him adding the wrong ingredient for the third time, not pomegranate juice
[16718]11667  ' Right,' said Harry vaguely, putting down the bottle and continuing to watch the corner
[16719]2313    Umbridge had just got to her feet
[16720]10619    Ha,' he said softly, as she strode between two lines of desks towards Snape, who was bending over Dean Thomas's cauldron
[16721]10530   Well, the class seem fairly advanced for their level,' she said briskly to Snape's back
[16722]900    Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution
[16723]807    I think the Ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus
[16724]1415   'Snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her
[16725]0   Now 
[16726]0   
[16727]0   
[16728]620    how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts
[16729]457  ' she asked, her quill poised over her clipboard
[16730]669   Fourteen years,' Snape replied
[16731]68    His expression was unfathomable
[16732]6486    Harry, watching him closely, added a few drops to his potion; it hissed menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange
[16733]574   You applied first for the Defence Against the Dark Arts post, I believe
[16734]2158  ' Professor Umbridge asked Snape
[16735]5995   Yes,' said Snape quietly
[16736]1   But you were unsuccessful
[16737]5276  'Snape's lip curled
[16738]45   Obviously
[16739]1362   'Professor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard
[16740]839   And you have applied regularly for the Defence Against the Dark Arts post since you first joined the school, I believe
[16741]6178  'Yes,' said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips
[16742]742    He looked very angry
[16743]940   Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you
[16744]927  ' asked Umbridge
[16745]5691   I suggest you ask him,' said Snape jerkily
[16746]6883   Oh, I shall,' said Professor Umbridge, with a sweet smile
[16747]66   I suppose this is relevant
[16748]1571  ' Snape asked, his black eyes narrowed
[16749]7803   Oh yes,' said Professor Umbridge, yes, the Ministry wants a thorough understanding of teachers'-er-backgrounds
[16750]1059   'She turned away, walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began questioning her about the lessons
[16751]7718    Snape looked round at Harry and their eyes met for a second
[16752]6003    Harry hastily dropped his gaze to his potion, which was now congealing foully and giving off a
[16753]69    strong smell of burned rubber
[16754]16999   No marks again, then, Potter,' said Snape maliciously, emptying Harry's cauldron with a wave of his wand
[16755]620    You will write me an essay on the correct composition of this potion, indicating how and why you went wrong, to be handed in next lesson, do you understand
[16756]11159  'Yes,' said Harry furiously
[16757]1188    Snape had already given them homework and he had Quidditch practice this evening; this would mean another couple of sleepless nights
[16758]1023    It did not seem possible that he had awoken that morning feeling very happy
[16759]671    All he felt now was a fervent desire for this day to end
[16760]6180   Maybe I'll skive off Divination,' he said glumly, as they stood in the courtyard after lunch, the wind whipping at the hems of robes and brims of hats
[16761]8807    I'll pretend to be ill and do Snape's essay instead, then I won't have to stay up half the night
[16762]9047   'You can't skive off Divination,' said Hermione severely
[16763]5176   Hark who's talking, you walked out of Divination, you hate Trelawney
[16764]7105  ' said Ron indignantly
[16765]9658   I don't hate her,' said Hermione loftily
[16766]6462    I just think she's an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud
[16767]14440    But Harry's already missed History of Magic and I don't think he ought to miss anything else today
[16768]6846  'There was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an hour later Harry took his seat in the hot, overperfumed atmosphere of the Divination classroom, feeling angry at everybody
[16769]936    Professor Trelawney was yet again handing out copies of The Dream Oracle
[16770]12906   Harry thought he'd surely be much better employed doing Snape's punishment essay than sitting here trying to find meaning in a lot of made-up dreams
[16771]140   It seemed, however, that he was not the only person in Divination who was in a temper
[16772]20075    Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of the Oracle down on the table between Harry and Ron and swept away, her lips pursed; she threw the next copy of the Oracle at Seamus and Dean, narrowly avoiding Seamus's head, and thrust the final one into Neville's chest with such force that he slipped off his pouffe
[16773]21   Well, carry on
[16774]7520  ' said Professor Trelawney loudly, her voice high-pitched and somewhat hysterical, you know what to do
[16775]428   Or am I such a sub-standard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book
[16776]267  'The class stared perplexedly at her, then at each other
[16777]6484    Harry, however, thought he knew what was the matter
[16778]15189    As Professor Trelawney flounced back to the high-backed teachers chair, her magnified eyes full of angry tears, he leaned his head closer to Ron's and muttered, I think she's got the results of her inspection back
[16779]751   'Professor
[16780]6569  ' said Parvati Patil in a hushed voice (she and Lavender had always rather admired Professor Trelawney)
[16781]950    Professor, is there anything-er-wrong
[16782]78  'Wrong
[16783]1440  ' cried Professor Trelawney in a voice throbbing with emotion
[16784]35    Certainly not
[16785]40   I have been insulted, certainly

[16792]0   
[16793]0   
[16794]113    but no, there is nothing wrong, certainly not
[16795]1817  'She took a great shuddering breath and looked away from Parvati, angry tears spilling from under her glasses
[16796]482   I say nothing,' she choked, of sixteen years of devoted service 
[16797]0   
[16798]0   
[16799]181    it has passed, apparently, unnoticed 
[16800]0   
[16801]0   
[16802]5    but I shall not be insulted, no, I shall not
[16803]5506  ' But, Professor, who's insulting you
[16804]408  ' asked Parvati timidly
[16805]1   The Establishment
[16806]6545  ' said Professor Trelawney, in a deep, dramatic, wavering voice
[16807]2317    Yes, those with eyes too clouded by the mundane to See as I See, to Know as I Know 
[16808]0   
[16809]0   
[16810]228    of course, we Seers have always been feared, always persecuted 
[16811]0   
[16812]0   
[16813]6    it is-alas-our fate
[16814]1805   'She gulped, dabbed at her wet cheeks with the end of her shawl, then she pulled a small embroidered handkerchief from her sleeve, and blew her nose very hard with a sound like Peeves blowing a raspberry
[16815]2013   Ron sniggered
[16816]542    Lavender shot him a disgusted look
[16817]6115   Professor,' said Parvati, do you mean 
[16818]0   
[16819]0   
[16820]1322    is it something Professor Umbridge-
[16821]137  'Do not speak to me about that woman
[16822]1171  ' cried Professor Trelawney leaping to her feet, her beads rattling and her spectacles flashing
[16823]140    Kindly continue with your work
[16824]1267  'And she spent the rest of the lesson striding among them, tears still leaking from behind her glasses, muttering what sounded like threats under her breath

[16842]0   
[16843]9674   'You and Umbridge have got something in common,' Harry told Hermione quietly when they met again in Defence Against the Dark Arts
[16844]5082    She obviously reckons Trelawney's an old fraud, too 
[16845]0   
[16846]0   
[16847]5582    looks like she's put her on probation
[16848]1829   'Umbridge entered the room as he spoke, wearing her black velvet bow and an expression of great smugness
[16849]526   Good afternoon, class
[16850]1728   'Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,' they chanted dully
[16851]388   Wands away, please
[16852]649   'But there was no answering flurry of movement this time; nobody had bothered to take out their wands
[16853]847   Please turn to page thirty-four of Defensive Magical Theory and read the third chapter, entitled The Case for Non-Offensive Responses to Magical Attack"
[16854]14743    There will be-'-no need to talk,' Harry, Ron and Hermione said together, under their breaths
[16855]15620   No Quidditch practice,' said Angelina in hollow tones when Harry, Ron and Hermione entered the common room after dinner that night
[16856]146   But I kept my temper
[16857]10836  ' said Harry, horrified
[16858]9823    I didn't say anything to her, Angelina, I swear, I-'I know, I know, said Angelina miserably
[16859]6687    She just said she needed a bit of time to consider
[16860]7   'Consider what
[16861]7171  ' said Ron angrily
[16862]4886    She's given the Slytherins permission, why not us
[16863]7483  'But Harry could imagine how much Umbridge was enjoying holding the threat of no Gryffindor Quidditch team over their heads and could easily understand why she would not want to relinquish that weapon over them too soon
[16864]13590   Well,' said Hermione, look on the bright side-at least now you'll have time to do Snape's essay
[16865]4800  'That's a bright side, is it
[16866]9536  ' snapped Harry, while Ron stared incredulously at Hermione
[16867]268    No Quidditch practice, and extra Potions
[16868]6287  'Harry slumped down into a chair, dragged his Potions essay reluctantly from his bag and set to work
[16869]2417    It was very hard to concentrate; even though he knew Sirius was not due in the fire until much later, he could not help glancing into the flames every few minutes just in case
[16870]1738    There was also an incredible amount of noise in the room: Fred and George appeared finally to have perfected one type of Skiving Snackbox, which they were taking turns to demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd
[16871]736   First, Fred would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew, at which he would vomit spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in front of them
[16872]352    Then he would force down the purple end of the chew, at which the vomiting would immediately cease
[16873]11355    Lee Jordan, who was assisting the demonstration, was lazily Vanishing the vomit at regular intervals with the same Vanishing Spell Snape kept using on Harry's potions
[16874]7042   What with the regular sounds of retching, cheering and the sound of Fred and George taking advance orders from the crowd, Harry was finding it exceptionally difficult to focus on the correct method for Strengthening Solution
[16875]13188    Hermione was not helping matters; the cheers and the sound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred and George's bucket were punctuated by her loud and disapproving sniffs, which Harry found, if anything, more distracting
[16876]941   Just go and stop them, then
[16877]5809  ' he said irritably, after crossing out the wrong weight of powdered griffin claw for the fourth time
[16878]9330   I can't, they're not technically doing anything wrong,' said Hermione through gritted teeth
[16879]8481    They're quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves and I can't find a rule that says the other idiots aren't entitled to buy them, not unless they're proven to be dangerous in some way and it doesn't look as though they are
[16880]8551   'She, Harry and Ron watched George projectile-vomit into the bucket, gulp down the rest of the chew and straighten up, beaming with his arms wide to protracted applause
[16881]17248   You know, I don't get why Fred and George only got three OWLs each,' said Harry, watching as Fred, George and Lee collected gold from the eager crowd
[16882]1129    They really know their stuff
[16883]12817   'Oh, they only know flashy stuff that's of no real use to anyone,' said Hermione disparagingly
[16884]160   No real use
[16885]7634  ' said Ron in a strained voice
[16886]2330    Hermione, they've made about twenty-six Galleons already
[16887]12281   'It was a long while before the crowd around the Weasley twins dispersed, then Fred, Lee and George sat up counting their takings even longer, so it was well past midnight when Harry, Ron and Hermione finally had the common room to themselves
[16888]2647    At long last, Fred had closed the doorway to the boys' dormitories behind him, rattling his box of Galleons ostentatiously so that Hermione scowled
[16889]6464    Harry, who was making very little progress with his Potions essay, decided to give it up for the night
[16890]3405    As he put his books away, Ron, who was dozing lightly in an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, and looked blearily into the fire
[16891]647   Sirius
[16892]5086  ' he said
[16893]5870   Harry whipped round
[16894]6329    Sirius's untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again
[16895]5155   Hi,' he said, grinning
[16896]9392   Hi,' chorused Harry, Ron and Hermione, all three kneeling down on the hearthrug
[16897]6456    Crookshanks purred loudly and approached the fire, trying, despite the heat, to put his face close to Sirius's
[16898]134   How're things
[16899]5733  ' said Sirius
[16900]13114   Not that good,' said Harry, as Hermione pulled Crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whiskers
[16901]5773    The Ministry's forced through another decree, which means we're not allowed to have Quidditch teams-'Or secret Defence Against the Dark Arts groups
[16902]5733  ' Said Sirius
[16903]92   There was a short pause
[16904]1438   How did you know about that
[16905]5761  ' Harry demanded
[16906]6271   You want to choose your meeting places more carefully,' said Sirius, grinning still more broadly
[16907]5372    The Hog's Head, I ask you
[16908]205   'Well, it was better than the Three Broomsticks
[16909]6707  ' said Hermione defensively
[16910]11512    That's always packed with people-'Which means you'd have been harder to overhear,' said Sirius
[16911]3114    You've got a lot to learn, Hermione
[16912]16   'Who overheard us
[16913]5761  ' Harry demanded
[16914]6752   Mundungus, of course,' said Sirius, and when they all looked puzzled he laughed
[16915]105    He was the witch under the veil
[16916]60   'That was Mundungus
[16917]10838  ' Harry said, stunned
[16918]5444    What was he doing in the Hog's Head
[16919]744  'What do you think he was doing
[16920]5778  ' said Sirius impatiently
[16921]412    Keeping an eye on you, of course
[16922]562   'I'm still being followed
[16923]6171  ' asked Harry angrily
[16924]10051   Yeah, you are,' said Sirius, and just as well, isn't it, if the first thing you're going to do on your weekend off is organise an illegal defence group
[16925]789   ' But he looked neither angry nor worried
[16926]6364    On the contrary, he was looking at Harry with distinct pride
[16927]52   Why was Dung hiding from us
[16928]2414  ' asked Ron, sounding disappointed
[16929]2219    We'd've liked to've seen him
[16930]17093   'He was banned from the Hog's Head twenty years ago,' said Sirius, and that barman's got a long memory
[16931]10038    We lost Moody's spare Invisibility Cloak when Sturgis was arrested, so Dung's been dressing as a witch a lot lately 
[16932]0   
[16933]0   
[16934]0    anyway 
[16935]0   
[16936]0   
[16937]2847    first of all, Ron-I've sworn to pass on a message from your mother
[16938]639   ' Oh yeah
[16939]7135  ' said Ron, sounding apprehensive
[16940]647   She says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an illegal secret Defence Against the Dark Arts group
[16941]943    She says you'll be expelled for sure and your future will be ruined
[16942]1429    She says there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be worrying about that right now
[16943]13967    She also' (Sirius's eyes turned to the other two) advises Harry and Hermione not to proceed with the group, though she accepts that she has no authority over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has their best interests at heart
[16944]8278    She would have written all this to you, but if the owl had been intercepted you'd all have been in real trouble, and she can't say it for herself because she's on duty tonight
[16945]195   'On duty doing what
[16946]7243  ' said Ron quickly
[16947]6914   Never you mind, just stuff for the Order,' said Sirius
[16948]9161    So it's fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell her I passed it all on, because I don't think she trusts me to
[16949]8016   'There was another pause in which Crookshanks, mewing, attempted to paw Sirius's head, and Ron fiddled with a hole in the hearthrug
[16950]1651   So, you want me to say I'm not going to take part in the Defence group
[16951]166  ' he muttered finally
[16952]0   Me
[16953]35   Certainly not
[16954]6380  ' said Sirius, looking surprised
[16955]5458    I think it's an excellent idea
[16956]0  'You do
[16957]10922  ' said Harry, his heart lifting
[16958]217   Of course I do
[16959]5733  ' said Sirius
[16960]3568    D'you think your father and I would've lain down and taken orders from an old hag like Umbridge
[16961]7753  'But-last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take risks-'Last year, all the evidence was that someone inside Hogwarts was trying to kill you, Harry
[16962]5778  ' said Sirius impatiently
[16963]8572    This year, we know there's someone outside Hogwarts who'd like to kill us all, so I think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea
[16964]43  'And if we do get expelled
[16965]2950  ' Hermione asked, a quizzical look on her face
[16966]1911   Hermione, this whole thing was your idea
[16967]10995  ' said Harry, staring at her
[16968]771   I know it was
[16969]6985    I just wondered what Sirius thought,' she said, shrugging
[16970]6474   Well, better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue,' said Sirius
[16971]13210   Hear, hear,' said Harry and Ron enthusiastically
[16972]5782   So,' said Sirius, how are you organising this group
[16973]68   Where are you meeting
[16974]15792  'Well, that's a bit of a problem now,' said Harry
[16975]659    Dunno where we're going to be able to go
[16976]16   'How about the Shrieking Shack
[16977]661  ' suggested Sirius
[16978]4887   Hey, that's an idea
[16979]15486  ' said Ron excitedly, but Hermione made a sceptical noise and all three of them looked at her, Sirius's head turning in the flames
[16980]14257   Well, Sirius, it's just that there were only four of you meeting in the Shrieking Shack when you were at school,' said Hermione, and all of you could transform into animals and I suppose you could all have squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if you'd wanted to
[16981]9377    But there are twenty-eight of us and none of us is an Animagus, so we wouldn't need so much an Invisibility Cloak as an Invisibility Marquee-'Fair point,' said Sirius, looking slightly crestfallen
[16982]1671    Well, I'm sure you'll come up with somewhere
[16983]584    There used to be a pretty roomy secret passageway behind that big mirror on the fourth floor, you might have enough space to practise jinxes in there
[16984]17289   'Fred and George told me it's blocked,' said Harry, shaking his head
[16985]1    Caved in or something
[16986]362   'Oh 
[16987]0   
[16988]0   
[16989]5774   ' said Sirius, frowning
[16990]1174    Well, I'll have a think and get back to-'He broke off
[16991]656    His face was suddenly tense, alarmed
[16992]1226    He turned sideways, apparently looking into the solid brick wall of the fireplace
[16993]647   Sirius
[16994]10853  ' said Harry anxiously
[16995]58   But he had vanished
[16996]10443    Harry gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at Ron and Hermione
[16997]667   Why did he-
[16998]2343  'Hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet, still staring at the fire
[16999]1328   A hand had appeared amongst the flames, groping as though to catch hold of something; a stubby, short-fingered hand covered in ugly old-fashioned rings
[17000]62   The three of them ran for it
[17001]6986    At the door of the boys' dormitory Harry looked back
[17002]11847    Umbridge's hand was still making snatching movements amongst the flames, as though she knew exactly where Sirius's hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it

[17006]6368     Umbridge has been reading your mail, Harry
[17007]4765    There's no other explanation
[17008]1275   ' You think Umbridge attacked Hedwig
[17009]5095  ' he said, outraged
[17010]7202   I'm almost certain of it,' said Hermione grimly
[17011]4859    Watch your frog, it's escaping
[17012]6473   'Harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully towards the other side of the table-Accio
[17013]392  '- and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand
[17014]333   Charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private chat; there was generally so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard was very slight
[17015]16786    Today, with the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows, Harry, Ron and Hermione's whispered discussion about how Umbridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite unnoticed
[17016]2659   I've been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering Dungbombs, because it seemed such a stupid lie,' Hermione whispered
[17017]12951    I mean, once your letter had been read it would have been quite clear you weren't ordering them, so you wouldn't have been in trouble at all-it's a bit of a feeble joke, isn't it
[17018]1583   But then I thought, what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail
[17019]15183   Well then, it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it -tip off Filch, let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it-I don't think Filch would object, when's he ever stuck up for a student's rights
[17020]5757   Harry, you're squashing your frog
[17021]7160   'Harry looked down; he was indeed squeezing his bullfrog so tightly its eyes were popping; he replaced it hastily upon the desk
[17022]6989   It was a very, very close call last night,' said Hermione
[17023]1572    I just wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was
[17024]8    Silencio
[17025]142   'The bullfrog on which she was practising her Silencing Charm was struck dumb mid-croak and glared at her reproachfully
[17026]6543   If she'd caught Snuffles-'Harry finished the sentence for her
[17027]841   -He'd probably be back in Azkaban this morning
[17028]1725   ' He waved his wand without really concentrating; his bullfrog swelled like a green balloon and emitted a high-pitched whistle
[17029]8   Silencio
[17030]17770  ' said Hermione hastily, pointing her wand at Harry's frog, which deflated silently before them
[17031]7066    Well, he mustn't do it again, that's all
[17032]6100    I just don't know how we're going to let him know
[17033]2430    We can't send him an owl
[17034]10667   'I don't reckon he'll risk it again,' said Ron
[17035]5695    He's not stupid, he knows she nearly got him
[17036]8    Silencio
[17037]581   'The large and ugly raven in front of him let out a derisive caw
[17038]8   Silencio
[17039]8    SILENCIO
[17040]141  'The raven cawed more loudly
[17041]22532   It's the way you're moving your wand,' said Hermione, watching Ron critically, you don't want to wave it, it's more a sharp jab
[17042]7194   'Ravens are harder than frogs,' said Ron through clenched teeth
[17043]18594   Fi ne, let's swap,' said Hermione, seizing Ron's raven and replacing it with her own fat bullfrog
[17044]8    Silencio
[17045]806  ' The raven continued to open and close its sharp beak, but no sound came out
[17046]457   Very good, Miss Granger
[17047]20927  ' said Professor Flitwick's squeaky little voice, making Harry, Ron and Hermione all jump
[17048]778    Now, let me see you try, Mr
[17049]645    Weasley' Wha-
[17050]8378   Oh-oh, right,' said Ron, very flustered
[17051]129    Er-silencio
[17052]791  ' He jabbed at the bullfrog so hard he poked it in the eye: the frog gave a deafening croak and leapt off the desk
[17053]8241   It came as no surprise to any of them that Harry and Ron were given additional practice of the Silencing Charm for homework
[17054]435   They were allowed to remain inside over break due to the downpour outside
[17055]5852    They found seats in a noisy and overcrowded classroom on the first floor in which Peeves was floating dreamily up near the chandelier, occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of somebody's head
[17056]693    They had barely sat down when Angelina came struggling towards them through the groups of gossiping students
[17057]1396   I've got permission
[17058]5086  ' she said
[17059]266    To re-form the Quidditch team
[17060]35  'Excellent
[17061]12820  ' said Ron and Harry together
[17062]5491   Yeah,' said Angelina, beaming
[17063]1833    I went to McGonagall and I think she might have appealed to Dumbledore
[17064]571    Anyway, Umbridge had to give in
[17065]29    Ha
[17066]3341   So I want you down at the pitch at seven o'clock tonight, all right, because we've got to make up time
[17067]450    You realise we're only three weeks away from our first match
[17068]1012  'She squeezed away from them, narrowly dodged an ink pellet from Peeves, which hit a nearby first-year instead, and vanished from sight
[17069]7940   Ron's smile slipped slightly as he looked out of the window, which was now opaque with hammering rain
[17070]66   Hope this clears up
[17071]6365    What's up with you, Hermione
[17072]832  'She, too, was gazing at the window, but not as though she really saw it
[17073]1012    Her eyes were unfocused and there was a frown on her face
[17074]896   Just thinking

[17099]2361    aren't we
[17100]8410  'Harry and Ron looked at each other
[17101]7091   Well, that clears that up,' said Ron
[17102]3437    It would've been really annoying if you hadn't explained yourself properly
[17103]3149   'Hermione looked at him as though she had only just realised he was there
[17104]7933   I was just wondering,' she said, her voice stronger now, whether we're doing the right thing, starting this Defence Against the Dark Arts group
[17105]0   'What
[17106]12820  ' said Harry and Ron together
[17107]1909   Hermione, it was your idea in the first place
[17108]7105  ' said Ron indignantly
[17109]7548   I know,' said Hermione, twisting her fingers together
[17110]152    But after talking to Snuffles 
[17111]0   
[17112]0   
[17113]15568   'But he's all for it,' said Harry
[17114]7331   Yes,' said Hermione, staring at the window again
[17115]8580    Yes, that's what made me think maybe it wasn't a good idea after all 
[17116]0   
[17117]0   
[17118]485   'Peeves floated over them on his stomach, peashooter at the ready; automatically all three of them lifted their bags to cover their heads until he had passed
[17119]20502   Let's get this straight,' said Harry angrily, as they put their bags back on the floor, Sirius agrees with us, so you don't think we should do it any more
[17120]2322  ' Hermione looked tense and rather miserable
[17121]5467    Now staring at her own hands, she said, Do you honestly trust his judgement
[17122]292  'Yes, I do
[17123]10818  ' said Harry at once
[17124]5100    He's always given us great advice
[17125]364  'An ink pellet whizzed past them, striking Katie Bell squarely in the ear
[17126]4224    Hermione watched Katie leap to her feet and start throwing things at Peeves; it was a few moments before Hermione spoke again and it sounded as though she was choosing her words very carefully
[17127]3503   You don't think he has become 
[17128]0   
[17129]0   
[17130]70    sort of

[17140]87    kind of 
[17141]0   
[17142]0

[17144]877  'What d'you mean, living through us"

[17146]231   I mean 
[17147]0   
[17148]0   
[17149]2214    well, I think he'd love to be forming secret Defence societies right under the nose of someone from the Ministry 
[17150]0   
[17151]0   
[17152]5893    I think he's really frustrated at how little he can do where he is 
[17153]0   
[17154]0   
[17155]5420    so I think he's keen to kind of

[17158]18    egg us on
[17159]2698   'Ron looked utterly perplexed
[17160]8019   Sirius is right,' he said, you do sound just like my mother
[17161]2571   'Hermione bit her lip and did not answer
[17162]1598    The bell rang just as Peeves swooped down on Katie and emptied an entire ink bottle over her head
[17163]9743   The weather did not improve as the day wore on, so that at seven o'clock that evening, when Harry and Ron went down to the Quidditch pitch for practice, they were soaked through within minutes, their feet slipping and sliding on the sodden grass
[17164]660    The sky was a deep, thundery grey and it was a relief to gain the warmth and light of the changing rooms, even if they knew the respite was only temporary
[17165]999    They found Fred and George debating whether to use one of their own Skiving Snackboxes to get out of flying
[17166]0   
[17167]0   
[17168]0   
[17169]7846    but I bet she'd know what we'd done,' Fred said out of the corner of his mouth
[17170]2449    If only I hadn't offered to sell her some Puking Pastilles yesterday
[17171]5895   ' We could try the Fever Fudge,' George muttered, no one's seen that yet-' Does it work
[17172]2138  ' enquired Ron hopefully, as the hammering of rain on the roof intensified and wind howled around the building
[17173]6919   Well, yeah,' said Fred, your temperature'll go right up
[17174]8031   'But you get these massive pus-filled boils, too,' said George, and we haven't worked out how to get rid of them yet
[17175]9606   'I can't see any boils,' said Ron, staring at the twins
[17176]8166   No, well, you wouldn't,' said Fred darkly, they're not in a place we generally display to the public
[17177]11901   'But they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the-'All right, everyone, listen up,' said Angelina loudly, emerging from the Captain's office
[17178]17644    I know it's not ideal weather, but there's a chance we'll be playing Slytherin in conditions like this so it's a good idea to work out how we're going to cope with them
[17179]8733    Harry, didn't you do something to your glasses to stop the rain fogging them up when we played Hufflepuff in that storm
[17180]13100  'Hermione did it,' said Harry
[17181]5750    He pulled out his wand, tapped his glasses and said, Impervius
[17182]5883  'I think we all ought to try that,' said Angelina
[17183]1765    If we could just keep the rain off our faces it would really help visibility-all together, come on-Impervius
[17184]82  OK
[17185]5070    Let's go
[17186]678   'They all stowed their wands back in the inside pockets of their robes, shouldered their brooms and followed Angelina out of the changing rooms
[17187]592   They squelched through the deepening mud to the middle of the pitch; visibility was still very poor even with the Impervius Charm; light was fading fast and curtains of rain were sweeping the grounds
[17188]798   All right, on my whistle,' shouted Angelina
[17189]6453   Harry kicked off from the ground, spraying mud in all directions, and shot upwards, the wind pulling him slightly off course
[17190]1141   He had no idea how he was going to see the Snitch in this weather; he was having enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were practising; a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it
[17191]773    Unfortunately, Angelina did not see this
[17192]1090    In fact, she did not appear to be able to see anything; none of them had a clue what the others were doing
[17193]6126    The wind was picking up; even at a distance Harry could hear the swishing, pounding sounds of the rain pummelling the surface of the lake
[17194]402   Angelina kept them at it for nearly an hour before conceding defeat
[17195]1402    She led her sodden and disgruntled team back into the changing rooms, insisting that the practice had not been a waste of time, though without any real conviction in her voice
[17196]1508    Fred and George were looking particularly annoyed; both were bandy-legged and winced with every movement
[17197]6245    Harry could hear them complaining in low voices as he towelled his hair dry
[17198]6642   I think a few of mine have ruptured,' said Fred in a hollow voice
[17199]8809   Mine haven't,' said George, through clenched teeth, they're throbbing like mad

[17203]12   'OUCH

[17205]1148   He pressed the towel to his face, his eyes screwed tight with pain
[17206]190    The scar on his forehead had seared again, more painfully than it had in weeks
[17207]4750   What's up
[17208]5131  ' said several voices
[17209]12329   Harry emerged from behind his towel; the changing room was blurred because he was not wearing his glasses, but he could still tell that everyone's face was turned towards him
[17210]5021   Nothing,' he muttered, I-poked myself in the eye, that's all
[17211]3469   'But he gave Ron a significant look and the two of them hung back as the rest of the team filed back outside, muffled in their cloaks, their hats pulled low over their ears
[17212]143   What happened
[17213]7925  ' said Ron, the moment Alicia had disappeared through the door
[17214]90    Was it your scar

[17227]0   
[17228]66    angry
[17229]6784   'Harry had not meant to say that at all, and heard the words as though a stranger had spoken them-yet knew at once that they were true
[17230]2848    He did not know how he knew it, but he did; Voldemort, wherever he was, whatever he was doing, was in a towering temper
[17231]667   Did you see him
[17232]7711  ' said Ron, looking horrified
[17233]667    Did you 
[17234]0   
[17235]0   
[17236]23    get a vision, or something
[17237]6756  'Harry sat quite still, staring at his feet, allowing his mind and his memory to relax in the aftermath of the pain
[17238]121   A confused tangle of shapes, a howling rush of voices 
[17239]0   
[17240]0   
[17241]9985   He wants something done, and it's not happening fast enough,' he said
[17242]1180   Again, he felt surprised to hear the words coming out of his mouth, and yet was quite certain they were true
[17243]0   But 
[17244]0   
[17245]0   
[17246]771    how do you know
[17247]7088  ' said Ron
[17248]7024   Harry shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands, pressing down upon them with his palms
[17249]317    Little stars erupted in them
[17250]4809    He felt Ron sit down on the bench beside him and knew Ron was staring at him
[17251]556   Is this what it was about last time
[17252]7641  ' said Ron in a hushed voice
[17253]5642    When your scar hurt in Umbridge's office
[17254]837   You-Know-Who was angry
[17255]6288  'Harry shook his head
[17256]0   What is it, then
[17257]5820  'Harry was thinking himself back
[17258]6447    He had been looking into Umbridge's face 
[17259]0   
[17260]0   
[17261]151    his scar had hurt 
[17262]0   
[17263]0   
[17264]287    and he had had that odd feeling in his stomach 
[17265]0   
[17266]0   
[17267]211    a strange, leaping feeling 
[17268]0   
[17269]0   
[17270]222    a happy feeling 
[17271]0   
[17272]0   
[17273]428    but of course, he had not recognised it for what it was, as he had been feeling so miserable himself 
[17274]0   
[17275]0   
[17276]5701   Last time, it was because he was pleased,' he said
[17277]347    Really pleased
[17278]388    He thought 
[17279]0   
[17280]0   
[17281]879    something good was going to happen
[17282]652    And the night before we came back to Hogwarts 
[17283]0   
[17284]0   
[17285]7853   ' he thought back to the moment when his scar had hurt so badly in his and Ron's bedroom in Grimmauld Place 
[17286]0   
[17287]0   
[17288]27    he was furious
[17289]2812   He looked round at Ron, who was gaping at him
[17290]5734   You could take over from Trelawney, mate,' he said in an awed voice
[17291]11368   I'm not making prophecies,' said Harry
[17292]953   No, you know what you're doing
[17293]7174  ' Ron said, sounding both scared and impressed
[17294]11459    Harry, you're reading You-Know-Who's mind
[17295]11404  'No,' said Harry, shaking his head
[17296]5484    It's more like 
[17297]0   
[17298]0   
[17299]95    his mood, I suppose
[17300]6151    I'm just getting flashes of what mood he's in
[17301]6849    Dumbledore said something like this was happening last year
[17302]5873    He said that when Voldemort was near me, or when he was feeling hatred, I could tell
[17303]5418    Well, now I'm feeling it when he's pleased, too 
[17304]0   
[17305]0   
[17306]27   'There was a pause
[17307]73    The wind and rain lashed at the building
[17308]8803   You've got to tell someone,' said Ron
[17309]1525   I told Sirius last time
[17310]888   'Well, tell him about this time
[17311]2308  'Can't, can I
[17312]10847  ' said Harry grimly
[17313]891    Umbridge is watching the owls and the fires, remember
[17314]817  'Well then, Dumbledore
[17315]13328   'I've just told you, he already knows,' said Harry shortly, getting to his feet, taking his cloak off his peg and swinging it around him
[17316]4928    There's no point telling him again
[17317]8644   'Ron did up the fastening of his own cloak, watching Harry thoughtfully
[17318]7630   Dumbledore'd want to know,' he said
[17319]5749   Harry shrugged
[17320]59   C'mon 
[17321]0   
[17322]0   
[17323]1446    we've still got Silencing Charms to practise
[17324]621   'They hurried back through the dark grounds, sliding and stumbling up the muddy lawns, not talking
[17325]5992    Harry was thinking hard
[17326]595    What was it that Voldemort wanted done that was not happening quickly enough
[17327]0  
[17328]0   
[17329]0   
[17330]5454    he's got other plans 
[17331]0   
[17332]0   
[17333]159    plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed 
[17334]0

[17336]75    stuff he can only get by stealth 
[17337]0   
[17338]0   
[17339]768    like a weapon
[17340]3264    Something he didn't have last time
[17341]7840   'Harry had not thought about those words in weeks; he had been too absorbed in what was going on at Hogwarts, too busy dwelling on the ongoing battles with Umbridge, the injustice of all the Ministry interference 
[17342]0   
[17343]0   
[17344]252    but now they came back to him and made him wonder 
[17345]0   
[17346]0   
[17347]5511    Voldemort's anger would make sense if he was no nearer to laying hands on the weapon, whatever it was
[17348]287    Had the Order thwarted him, stopped him from seizing it
[17349]113   Where was it kept
[17350]0   Who had it now
[17351]20346  Mimbulus mimbletonia,' said Ron's voice and Harry came back to his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the common room
[17352]2742   It appeared that Hermione had gone to bed early, leaving Crookshanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly knitted elf hats lying on a table by the fire
[17353]7678    Harry was rather grateful that she was not around, because he did not much want to discuss his scar hurting and have her urge him to go to Dumbledore, too
[17354]16911    Ron kept throwing him anxious glances, but Harry pulled out his Charms books and set to work on finishing his essay, though he was only pretending to concentrate and by the time Ron said he was going up to bed, too, he had written hardly anything
[17355]6490   Midnight came and went while Harry was reading and rereading a passage about the uses of scurvy-grass, lovage and sneezewort and not taking in a word of it
[17356]294   These plantes are moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and are therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts, where the wizard is desirous of producing hot-headedness and recklessness

[17358]0   
[17359]0   
[17360]0   
[17361]0   
[17362]7576    Hermione said Sirius was becoming reckless cooped up in Grimmauld Place

[17383]0    
[17384]0   
[17385]0   
[17386]2479    confusing was the word, all right; why did he know what Voldemort was feeling
[17387]1002   What was this weird connection between them, which Dumbledore had never been able to explain satisfactorily
[17388]0  
[17389]0   
[17390]0   
[17391]149    where the wizard is desirous

[17409]233    it was warm and comfortable in his armchair before the fire, with the rain still beating heavily on the windowpanes, Crookshanks purring, and the crackling of the flames 
[17410]0   
[17411]0   
[17412]10715   The book slipped from Harry's slack grip and landed with a dull thud on the hearthrug
[17413]542    His head lolled sideways 
[17414]0   
[17415]0   
[17416]339   He was walking once more along a windowless corridor, his footsteps echoing in the silence
[17417]971    As the door at the end of the passage loomed larger, his heart beat fast with excitement 
[17418]0   
[17419]0   
[17420]245    if he could only open it 
[17421]0   
[17422]0   
[17423]13    enter beyond 
[17424]0   
[17425]0   
[17426]389   He stretched out his hand 
[17427]0   
[17428]0   
[17429]33    his fingertips were inches from it 
[17430]0   
[17431]0   
[17432]6336   Harry Potter, sir
[17433]89  'He awoke with a start
[17434]774    The candles had all been extinguished in the common room, but there was something moving close by
[17435]1   Whozair
[17436]11068  ' said Harry, sitting upright in his chair
[17437]755    The fire was almost out, the room very dark
[17438]457   Dobby has your owl, sir
[17439]5628  ' said a squeaky voice
[17440]211   Dobby
[17441]11419  ' said Harry thickly, peering through the gloom towards the source of the voice
[17442]3004   Dobby the house-elf was standing beside the table on which Hermione had left half a dozen of her knitted hats
[17443]4618    His large, pointed ears were now sticking out from beneath what looked like all the hats Hermione had ever knitted; he was wearing one on top of the other, so that his head seemed elongated by two or three feet, and on the very topmost bobble sat Hedwig, hooting serenely and obviously cured
[17444]18545   Dobby volunteered to return Harry Potter's owl,' said the elf squeakily, with a look of positive adoration on his face, Professor Grubbly-Plank says she is all well now, sir
[17445]12060   ' He sank into a deep bow so that his pencil-like nose brushed the threadbare surface of the hearthrug and Hedwig gave an indignant hoot and fluttered on to the arm of Harry's chair
[17446]251   Thanks, Dobby
[17447]17153  ' said Harry, stroking Hedwig's head and blinking hard, trying to rid himself of the image of the door in his dream 
[17448]0   
[17449]0   
[17450]6    it had been very vivid
[17451]1738    Surveying Dobby more closely, he noticed that the elf was also wearing several scarves and innumerable socks, so that his feet looked far too big for his body
[17452]121   Er 
[17453]0   
[17454]0   
[17455]6577    have you been taking all the clothes Hermione's been leaving out
[17456]5842  'Oh, no, sir,' said Dobby happily
[17457]483    Dobby has been taking some for Winky, too, sir
[17458]281   'Yeah, how is Winky
[17459]6088  ' asked Harry
[17460]5008   Bobby's ears drooped slightly
[17461]6237   Winky is still drinking lots, sir,' he said sadly, his enormous round green eyes, large as tennis balls, downcast
[17462]6379    She still does not care for clothes, Harry Potter
[17463]231    Nor do the other house-elves
[17464]499    None of them will clean Gryffindor Tower any more, not with the hats and socks hidden everywhere, they finds them insulting, sir
[17465]8215    Dobby does it all himself, sir, but Dobby does not mind, sir, for he always hopes to meet Harry Potter and tonight, sir, he has got his wish
[17466]354  ' Dobby sank into a deep bow again
[17467]12495    But Harry Potter does not seem happy,' Dobby went on, straightening up again and kicking timidly at Harry
[17468]562    Dobby heard him muttering in his sleep
[17469]6421    Was Harry Potter having bad dreams
[17470]11705  'Not really bad,' said Harry, yawning and rubbing his eyes
[17471]749    I've had worse
[17472]7077   'The elf surveyed Harry out of his vast, orb-like eyes
[17473]18590    Then he said very seriously, his ears drooping, Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter, for Harry Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much, much happier now
[17474]5767   'Harry smiled
[17475]2714   You can't help me, Dobby, but thanks for the offer
[17476]199   'He bent and picked up his Potions book
[17477]798    He'd have to try to finish the essay tomorrow
[17478]1888    He closed the book and as he did so the firelight illuminated the thin white scars on the back of his hand-the result of his detentions with Umbridge 
[17479]0   
[17480]0   
[17481]11497   Wait a moment- there is something you can do for me, Dobby,' said Harry slowly
[17482]940   The elf looked round, beaming
[17483]6336   Name it, Harry Potter, sir
[17484]1210  'I need to find a place where twenty-eight people can practise Defence Against the Dark Arts without being discovered by any of the teachers
[17485]7627    Especially,' Harry clenched his hand on the book, so that the scars shone pearly white, Professor Umbridge
[17486]5620   'He expected the elf's smile to vanish, his ears to droop; he expected him to say it was impossible, or else that he would try to find somewhere, but his hopes were not high
[17487]828    What he had not expected was for Dobby to give a little skip, his ears waggling cheerfully, and clap his hands together
[17488]617   Dobby knows the perfect place, sir
[17489]5126  ' he said happily
[17490]1650    Dobby heard tell of it from the other house-elves when he came to Hogwarts, sir
[17491]1523    It is known by us as the Come and Go Room, sir, or else as the Room of Requirement
[17492]0  'Why
[17493]10834  ' said Harry curiously
[17494]6108   Because it is a room that a person can only enter,' said Dobby seriously, when they have real need of it
[17495]4789    Sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the seeker's needs
[17496]7824    Dobby has used it, sir,' said the elf, dropping his voice and looking guilty, when Winky has been very drunk; he has hidden her in the Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to Butterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her on while she sleeps it off, sir 
[17497]0   
[17498]0   
[17499]648    and Dobby knows Mr
[17500]17843    Filch has found extra cleaning materials there when he has run short, sir, and-'And if you really needed a bathroom,' said Harry, suddenly remembering something Dumbledore had said at the Yule Ball the previous Christmas, would it fill itself with chamber pots
[17501]5687  'Dobby expects so, sir,' said Dobby, nodding earnestly
[17502]596    It is a most amazing room, sir
[17503]1083   'How many people know about it
[17504]11269  ' said Harry, sitting up straight er in his chair
[17505]143   Very few, sir
[17506]1602    Mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it, sir, but often they never finds it again, for they do not know that it is always there waiting to be called into service, sir
[17507]10982   'It sounds brilliant,' said Harry, his heart racing
[17508]258    It sounds perfect, Dobby
[17509]0    When can you show me where it is
[17510]23305  'Any time, Harry Potter, sir,' said Dobby, looking delighted at Harry's enthusiasm
[17511]734    We could go now, if you like
[17512]6215  'For a moment Harry was tempted to go with Dobby
[17513]8705    He was halfway out of his seat, intending to hurry upstairs for his Invisibility Cloak when, not for the first time, a voice very much like Hermione's whispered in his ear: reckless
[17514]5339   It was, after all, very late, he was exhausted, and had Snape's essay to finish
[17515]11210   Not tonight, Dobby,' said Harry reluctantly, sinking back into his chair
[17516]338    This is really important 
[17517]0   
[17518]0   
[17519]4070    I don't want to blow it, it'll need proper planning
[17520]1773    Listen, can you just tell me exactly where this Room of Requirement is, and how to get in there
[17521]1591  'Their robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across the flooded vegetable patch to double Herbology where they could hardly hear what Professor Sprout was saying over the hammering of raindrops hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof
[17522]6458    The afternoon's Care of Magical Creatures lesson was to be relocated from the storm-swept grounds to a free classroom on the ground floor and, to their intense relief, Angelina had sought out her team at lunch to tell them that Quidditch practice was cancelled
[17523]11298   Good,' said Harry quietly, when she
[17524]1151    told him, because we've found somewhere to have our first Defence meeting
[17525]581    Tonight, eight o'clock, seventh floor opposite that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy being clubbed by those trolls
[17526]399    Can you tell Katie and Alicia
[17527]1273  'She looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others
[17528]5800    Harry returned hungrily to his sausages and mash
[17529]2491    When he looked up to take a drink of pumpkin juice, he found Hermione watching him
[17530]0   What
[17531]5098  ' he said thickly
[17532]0   Well 
[17533]0   
[17534]0   
[17535]12925    it's just that Dobby's plans aren't always that safe
[17536]3260    Don't you remember when he lost you all the bones in your arm
[17537]9749  'This room isn't just some mad idea of Dobby's; Dumbledore knows about it, too, he mentioned it to me at the Yule Ball
[17538]6459   'Hermione's expression cleared
[17539]1139   Dumbledore told you about it
[17540]11670  'Just in passing,' said Harry, shrugging
[17541]12516   Oh, well, that's all right then,' said Hermione briskly and raised no more objections
[17542]8103   Together with Ron they had spent most of the day seeking out those people who had signed their names to the list in the Hog's Head and telling them where to meet that evening
[17543]17493    Somewhat to Harry's disappointment, it was Ginny who managed to find Cho Chang and her friend first; however, by the end of dinner he was confident that the news had been passed to every one of the twenty-five people who had turned up in the Hog's Head
[17544]17058   At half past seven Harry, Ron and Hermione left the Gryffindor common room, Harry clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in his hand
[17545]1857    Fifth-years were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine o'clock, but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they made their way along the seventh floor
[17546]6839   Hold it,' Harry warned, unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase, tapping it with his wand and muttering, I solemnly swear that I am up to no good
[17547]516   'A map of Hogwarts appeared on the blank surface of the parchment
[17548]784    Tiny black moving dots, labelled with names, showed where various people were
[17549]12403   Filch is on the second floor,' said Harry, holding the map close to his eyes, and Mrs
[17550]52    Norris is on the fourth
[17551]571   'And Umbridge
[17552]6736  ' said Hermione anxiously
[17553]11086   In her office,' said Harry, pointing
[17554]5152    OK, let's go
[17555]11501   'They hurried along the corridor to the place Dobby had described to Harry, a stretch of blank wall opposite an enormous tapestry depicting Barnabas the Barmy's foolish attempt to train trolls for the ballet
[17556]11252   OK,' said Harry quietly, while a moth-eaten troll paused in his relentless clubbing of the would-be ballet teacher to watch them
[17557]6263    Dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times, concentrating hard on what we need
[17558]2091   'They did so, turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank stretch of wall, then at the man-sized vase on its other side
[17559]14942    Ron had screwed up his eyes in concentration; Hermione was whispering something under her breath; Harry's fists were clenched as he stared ahead of him
[17560]238   We need somewhere to learn to fight

[17570]5732    Harry
[17571]6977  ' said Hermione sharply, as they wheeled around after their third walk past
[17572]772   A highly polished door had appeared in the wall
[17573]2953    Ron was staring at it, looking slightly wary
[17574]8535    Harry reached out, seized the brass handle, pulled open the door and led the way into a spacious room lit with flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors below
[17575]705   The walls were lined with wooden bookcases and instead of chairs the re were large silk cushions on the floor
[17576]12564    A set of shelves at the far end of the room carried a range of instruments such as Sneakoscopes, Secrecy Sensors and a large, cracked Foe-Glass that Harry was sure had hung, the previous year, in the fake Moody's office
[17577]7558   These will be good when we're practising Stunning,' said Ron enthusiastically, prodding one of the cushions with his foot
[17578]1345   And just look at these books
[17579]7079  ' said Hermione excitedly, running a finger along the spines of the large leather-bound tomes
[17580]136    A Compendium of Common Curses and their Counter-Actions 
[17581]0   
[17582]0   
[17583]376    The Dark Arts Outsmarted 
[17584]0   
[17585]0   
[17586]47    Self-Defensive Spellwork 
[17587]0   
[17588]0   
[17589]9    wow 
[17590]0   
[17591]0   
[17592]9813   ' She looked around at Harry, her face glowing, and he saw that the presence of hundreds of books had finally convinced Hermione that what they were doing was right
[17593]10692    Harry, this is wonderful, there's everything we need here
[17594]434  'And without further ado she slid Jinxes for the Jinxed from its shelf, sank on to the nearest cushion and began to read
[17595]521   There was a gentle knock on the door
[17596]6533    Harry looked round
[17597]853    Ginny, Neville, Lavender, Parvati and Dean had arrived
[17598]5346   Whoa,' said Dean, staring around, impressed
[17599]183    What is this place
[17600]6414  'Harry began to explain, but before he had finished more people had arrived and he had to start all over again
[17601]793    By the time eight o'clock arrived, every cushion was occupied
[17602]7979    Harry moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at him
[17603]1995    Hermione carefully marked her page of Jinxes for the Jinxed and set the book aside
[17604]11023   Well,' said Harry, slightly nervously
[17605]1862    This is the place we've found for practice sessions, and you've-er-obviously found it OK
[17606]4755   'It's fantastic
[17607]5571  ' said Cho, and several people murmured their agreement
[17608]10310   It's bizarre,' said Fred, frowning around at it
[17609]599    We once hid from Filch in here, remember, George
[17610]896   But it was just a broom cupboard then
[17611]10578   'Hey, Harry, what's this stuff
[17612]986  ' asked Dean from the rear of the room, indicating the Sneakoscopes and the Foe-Glass
[17613]11168   Dark detectors,' said Harry, stepping between the cushions to reach them
[17614]3699    Basically they all show when Dark wizards or enemies are around, but you don't want to rely on them too much, they can be fooled 
[17615]0   
[17616]0   
[17617]733   'He gazed for a moment into the cracked Foe-Glass; shadowy figures were moving around inside it, though none was recognisable
[17618]332    He turned his back on it
[17619]1655   Well, I've been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and-er-' He noticed a raised hand
[17620]1615    What, Hermione
[17621]7332  'I think we ought to elect a leader,' said Hermione
[17622]18031   Harry's leader,' said Cho at once, looking at Hermione as though she were mad
[17623]11214   Harry's stomach did yet another back-flip
[17624]7646   Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly,' said Hermione, unperturbed
[17625]48    It makes it formal and it gives him authority
[17626]5851    So-everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader
[17627]1289  'Everybody put up their hand, even Zacharias Smith, though he did it very half-heartedly
[17628]12210   Er-right, thanks,' said Harry, who could feel his face burning
[17629]1615    And-what,Hermione
[17630]6263  'I also think we ought to have a name,' she said brightly, her hand still in the air
[17631]3772    It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, don't you think
[17632]596  'Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League
[17633]5197  ' said Angelina hopefully
[17634]482   Or the Ministry of Magic are Morons Group
[17635]442  ' suggested Fred
[17636]10462   I was thinking,' said Hermione, frowning at Fred, more of a name that didn't tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside meetings
[17637]70   'The Defence Association
[17638]5236  ' said Cho
[17639]310    The DA for short, so nobody knows what we're talking about
[17640]10828  'Yeah, the DA's good,' said Ginny
[17641]23117    Only let's make it stand for Dumbledore's Army, because that's the Ministry's worst fear, isn't it
[17642]448  'There was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at this
[17643]42   All in favour of the DA
[17644]6738  ' said Hermione bossily, kneeling up on her cushion to count
[17645]4868    That's a majority-motion passed
[17646]17115  'She pinned the piece of parchment with all of their signatures on it on to the wall and wrote across the top in large letters:DUMBLEDORE'S ARMYRight,' said Harry, when she had sat down again, shall we get practising then
[17647]1108   I was thinking, the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm
[17648]12630    I know it's pretty basic but I've found it really useful-'Oh, please,' said Zacharias Smith, rolling his eyes and folding his arms
[17649]5018    I don't think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against You-Know-Who, do you
[17650]11718  ' I've used it against him,' said Harry quietly
[17651]115    It saved my life in June
[17652]382   ' Smith opened his mouth stupidly
[17653]594    The rest of the room was very quiet
[17654]16296   But if you think it's beneath you, you can leave,' Harry said
[17655]689   Smith did not move
[17656]688    Nor did anybody else
[17657]11906   OK,' said Harry, his mouth slightly drier than usual with all these eyes upon him, I reckon we should all divide into pairs and practise
[17658]705   'It felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not nearly as odd as seeing them followed
[17659]985    Everybody got to their feet at once and divided up
[17660]584    Predictably, Neville was left partnerless
[17661]6074   You can practise with me,' Harry told him
[17662]1139    Right-on the count of three, then-one, two, three-'The room was suddenly full of shouts of Expelliarmus
[17663]707   Wands flew in all directions; missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into the air
[17664]13081    Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went spinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm
[17665]2135    Glancing around, he thought he had been right to suggest they practise the basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding in Disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump backwards a few paces or wince as their feeble spell whooshed over them
[17666]9   Expelliarmus
[17667]12309  ' said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his wand fly out of his hand
[17668]667   I DID IT
[17669]5403  ' said Neville gleefully
[17670]1360    I've never done it before-I DID IT
[17671]343  ' Good one
[17672]16784  ' said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a real duel Neville's opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side
[17673]4539    Listen, Neville, can you take it in turns to practise with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing
[17674]6319  'Harry moved off into the middle of the room
[17675]136    Something very odd was happening to Zacharias Smith
[17676]2613    Every time he opened his mouth to disarm Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did not seem to be making a sound
[17677]8339    Harry did not have to look far to solve the mystery: Fred and George were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point their wands at his back
[17678]17317   Sorry Harry,' said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye
[17679]2444    Couldn't resist
[17680]6473   'Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong
[17681]767    Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her
[17682]2976    Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving his partner time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around them; Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin Finch-Fletchleys wand spinning out of his hand, at other times merely causing his hair to stand on end
[17683]215   OK, stop
[17684]5867  ' Harry shouted
[17685]133    Stop
[17686]133    STOP
[17687]907  'I need a whistle, he thought, and immediately spotted one lying on top of the nearest row of books
[17688]280    He caught it up and blew hard
[17689]75    Everyone lowered their wands
[17690]18569   That wasn't bad,' said Harry, but there's definite room for improvement
[17691]73   ' Zacharias Smith glared at him
[17692]5156    Let's try again
[17693]749   'He moved off around the room again, stopping here and there to make suggestions
[17694]148    Slowly, the general performance improved
[17695]1704   He avoided going near Cho and her friend for a while, but after walking twice around every other pair in the room felt he could not ignore them any longer
[17696]5650   Oh no,' said Cho rather wildly as he approached
[17697]1    Expelliarmious
[17698]232  I mean, Expellimellius
[17699]494   I-oh, sorry, Marietta
[17700]11206  'Her curly-haired friend's sleeve had caught fire; Marietta extinguished it with her own wand and glared at Harry as though it was his fault
[17701]770   You made me nervous, I was doing all right before then
[17702]6205  ' Cho told Harry ruefully
[17703]12477   That was quite good,' Harry lied, but when she raised her eyebrows he said, Well, no, it was lousy, but I know you can do it properly, I was watching from over there
[17704]52   'She laughed
[17705]1453    Her friend Marietta looked at them rather sourly and turned away
[17706]3349   Don't mind her,' Cho muttered
[17707]3476    She doesn't really want to be here but I made her come with me
[17708]675    Her parents have forbidden her to do anything that might upset Umbridge
[17709]312    You see-her mum works for the Ministry
[17710]60   'What about your parents
[17711]6088  ' asked Harry
[17712]6646   Well, they've forbidden me to get on the wrong side of Umbridge, too,' said Cho, drawing herself up proudly
[17713]19885    But if they think I'm not going to fight You-Know-Who after what happened to Cedric-'She broke off, looking rather confused, and an awkward silence fell between them; Terry Boot's wand went whizzing past Harry's ear and hit Alicia Spinnet hard on the nose
[17714]354   Well, my dad is very supportive of any anti-Ministry action
[17715]12609  ' said Luna Lovegood proudly from just behind Harry; evidently she had been eavesdropping on his conversation while Justin Finch-'Fletchley attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had flown up over his head
[17716]6281    He's always saying he'd believe anything of Fudge; I mean, the number of goblins Fudge has had assassinated
[17717]406   And of course he uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons, which he secretly feeds to anybody who disagrees with him
[17718]14763    And then there's his Umgubular Slashkilter-'Don't ask,' Harry muttered to Cho as she opened her mouth, looking puzzled
[17719]5    She giggled
[17720]8727   Hey, Harry,' Hermione called from the other end of the room, have you checked the time
[17721]1419  'He looked down at his watch and was shocked to see it was already ten past nine, which meant they needed to get back to their common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished by Filch for being out of bounds
[17722]608    He blew his whistle; everybody stopped shouting Expelliarmus' and the last couple of wands clattered to the floor
[17723]12809   Well, that was pretty good,' said Harry, but we've overrun, we'd better leave it here
[17724]794    Same time, same place next week
[17725]12  'Sooner
[17726]5603  ' said Dean Thomas eagerly and many people nodded in agreement
[17727]10588   Angelina, however, said quickly, The Quidditch season's about to start, we need team practices too
[17728]16405  'Let's say next Wednesday night, then,' said Harry, we can decide on additional meetings then
[17729]1729    Come on, we'd better get going
[17730]5380   'He pulled out the Marauder's Map again and checked it carefully for signs of teachers on the seventh floor
[17731]6148    He let them all leave in threes and fours, watching their tiny dots anxiously to see that they returned safely to their dormitories: the Hufflepuffs to the basement corridor that also led to the kitchens; the Ravenclaws to a tower on the west side of the castle, and the Gryffindors along the corridor to the Fat Lady's portrait
[17732]22228   That was really, really good, Harry,' said Hermione, when finally it was just her, Harry and Ron who were left
[17733]277   Yeah, it was
[17734]7842  ' said Ron enthusiastically, as they slipped out of the door and watched it melt back into stone behind them
[17735]8020    Did you see me disarm Hermione, Harry
[17736]6706  'Only once,' said Hermione, stung
[17737]10601    I got you loads more than you got me-'I did not only get you once, I got you at least three times-'Well, if you're counting the one where you tripped over your own feet and knocked the wand out of my hand-'They argued all the way back to the common room, but Harry was not listening to them
[17738]5289    He had one eye on the Marauder's Map, but he was also thinking of Cho saying he made her nervous

[17763]704    Lionfish 11/Nov/2007     Chapter Nineteen     The Lion and the SerpentContents  Prev Chapter  Next Chapter  
[17764]13252     Harry felt as though he were carrying some kind of talisman inside his chest over the following two weeks, a glowing secret that supported him through Umbridge's classes and even made it possible for him to smile blandly as he looked into her horrible bulging eyes
[17765]8928    He and the DA were resisting her under her very nose, doing the very thing she and the Ministry most feared, and whenever he was supposed to be reading Wilbert Slinkhard's book during her lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most recent meetings, remembering how Neville had successfully disarmed Hermione, how Colin Creevey had mastered the Impediment Jinx after three meetings' hard effort, how Parvati Patil had produced such a good Reductor Curse that she had reduced the table carrying all the Sneakoscopes to dust
[17766]11741   He was finding it almost impossible to fix a regular night of the week for the DA meetings, as they had to accommodate three separate: team's Quidditch practices, which were often rearranged due to bad weather conditions; but Harry was not sorry about this; he had a feeling that it was probably better to keep the timing of their meetings unpredictable
[17767]519    If anyone was watching them, it would be hard to make out a pattern
[17768]4246   Hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case they needed to change it at short notice, because it would look suspicious if people from different Houses were seen crossing the Great Hall to talk to each other too often
[17769]2871    She gave each of the members of the DA a fake Galleon (Ron became very excited when he first saw the basket and was convinced she was actually giving out gold)
[17770]55   You see the numerals around the edge of the coins
[17771]7124  ' Hermione said, holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meeting
[17772]214    The coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches
[17773]5767    On real Galleons that's just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the coin
[17774]704    On these fake coins, though, the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting
[17775]1013    The coins will grow hot when the date changes, so if you're carrying them in a pocket you'll be able to feel them
[17776]7778    We take one each, and when Harry sets the date of the next meeting he'll change the numbers on his coin, and because I've put a Protean Charm on them, they'll all change to mimic his
[17777]6604   ' A blank silence greeted Hermione's words
[17778]727    She looked around at all the faces upturned to her, rather disconcerted
[17779]12006   Well-I thought it was a good idea,' she said uncertainly, I mean, even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets, there's nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon, is there
[17780]0   But 
[17781]0   
[17782]0   
[17783]3430    well, if you don't want to use them-' You can do a Protean Charm
[17784]5100  ' said Terry Boot
[17785]6993   Yes,' said Hermione
[17786]4750   But that's 
[17787]0   
[17788]0   
[17789]9883    that's NEWT standard, that is,' he said weakly
[17790]7757   Oh,' said Hermione, trying to look modest
[17791]362    Oh 
[17792]0   
[17793]0   
[17794]0    well 
[17795]0   
[17796]0   
[17797]355    yes, I suppose it is
[17798]469   'How come you're not in Ravenclaw
[17799]1949  ' he demanded, staring at Hermione with something close to wonder
[17800]753    With brains like yours
[17801]8139  'Well, the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting me in Ravenclaw during my Sorting,' said Hermione brightly, but it decided on Gryffindor in the end
[17802]371    So, does that mean we're using the Galleons
[17803]214  'There was a murmur of assent and everybody moved forwards to collect one from the basket
[17804]8072    Harry looked sideways at Hermione
[17805]783   You know what these remind me of
[17806]4750  'No, what's that
[17807]256  'The Death Eaters' scars
[17808]2443    Voldemort touches one of them, and all their scars burn, and they know they've got to join him
[17809]0   'Well 
[17810]0   
[17811]0   
[17812]7931    yes,' said Hermione quietly, that is where I got the idea 
[17813]0   
[17814]0   
[17815]754    but you'll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal rather than on our members' skin
[17816]277   'Yeah 
[17817]0   
[17818]0   
[17819]11319    I prefer your way,' said Harry, grinning, as he slipped his Galleon into his pocket
[17820]118    I suppose the only danger with these is that we might accidentally spend them
[17821]10754   'Fat chance,' said Ron, who was examining his own fake Galleon with a slightly mournful air, I haven't got any real Galleons to confuse it with
[17822]875   ' As the first Quidditch match of the season, Gryffindor versus Slytherin, drew nearer, their DA meetings were put on hold because Angelina insisted on almost daily practices
[17823]1916    The fact that the Quidditch Cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game; the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome, for they, of course, would be playing both teams over the coming year; and the Heads of House of the competing teams, though they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretence of sportsmanship, were determined to see their own side victorious
[17824]7240    Harry realised how much Professor McGonagall cared about beating Slytherin when she abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the match
[17825]7413   I think you've got enough to be getting on with at the moment,' she said loftily
[17826]23203    Nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked directly at Harry and Ron and said grimly, I've become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really don't want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape, so use the extra time to practise, won't you
[17827]1108  'Snape was no less obviously partisan; he had booked the Quidditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play
[17828]574    He was also turning a deaf ear to the many reports of Slytherin attempts to hex Gryffindor players in the corridors
[17829]2409    When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her eyebrows growing so thick and fast they obscured her vision and obstructed her mouth, Snape insisted that she must have attempted a Hair-thickening Charm on herself and refused to listen to the fourteen eye-witnesses who insisted they had seen the Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx while she worked in the library
[17830]11392   Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindors chances; they had, after all, never lost to Malfoy's team
[17831]7078    Admittedly, Ron was still not performing to Wood's standard, but he was working extremely hard to improve
[17832]1104    His greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence after he'd made a blunder; if he let in one goal he became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more
[17833]14968    On the other hand, Harry had seen Ron make some truly spectacular saves when he was on form; during one memorable practice he had hung one-handed from his broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goalhoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the centre hoop at the other end; the rest of the team felt this save compared favourably with one made recently by Barry Ryan, the Irish International Keeper, against Poland's top Chaser, Ladislaw Zamojski
[17834]8578    Even Fred had said that Ron might yet make him and George proud, and that they were seriously considering admitting he was related to them, something they assured him they had been trying to deny for four years
[17835]9235   The only thing really worrying Harry was how much Ron was allowing the tactics of the Slytherin team to upset him before they even got on to the pitch
[17836]11590    Harry, of course, had endured their snide comments for over four years, so whispers of, Hey, Potty, I heard Warrington's sworn to knock you off your broom on Saturday', far from chilling his blood, made him laugh
[17837]19289    Warrington's aim's so pathetic I'd be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me,' he retorted, which made Ron and Hermione laugh and wiped the smirk off Pansy Parkinson's face
[17838]2016   But Ron had never endured a relentless campaign of insults, jeers and intimidation
[17839]2140    When Slytherins, some of them seventh-years and considerably larger than he was, muttered as they passed in the corridors, Got your bed booked in the hospital wing, Weasley
[17840]3197  ' he didn't laugh, but turned a delicate shade of green
[17841]11465    When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron dropping the Quaffle (which he did whenever they came within sight of each other), Ron's ears glowed red and his hands shook so badly that he was likely to drop whatever he was holding at the time, too
[17842]1002   October extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds and driving rain and November arrived, cold as frozen iron, with hard frosts every morning and icy draughts that bit at exposed hands and faces
[17843]1781    The skies and the ceiling of the Great Hall turned a pale, pearly grey, the mountains around Hogwarts were snowcapped, and the temperature in the castle dropped so low that many students wore their thick protective dragonskin gloves in the corridors between lessons
[17844]309   The morning of the match dawned bright and cold
[17845]14275    When Harry awoke he looked round at Ron's bed and saw him sitting bolt upright, his arms around his knees, staring fixedly into space
[17846]557   You all right
[17847]10818  ' said Harry
[17848]2803   Ron nodded but did not speak
[17849]10399    Harry was reminded forcibly of the time Ron had accidentally put a Slug-vomiting Charm on himself; he looked just as pale and sweaty as he had done then, not to mention as reluctant to open his mouth
[17850]11864   You just need some breakfast,' Harry said bracingly
[17851]59    C'mon
[17852]891   'The Great Hall was filling up fast when they arrived, the talk louder and the mood more exuberant than usual
[17853]546    As they passed the Slytherin table there was an upsurge of noise
[17854]7385    Harry looked round and saw that, in addition to the usual green and silver scarves and hats, every one of them was wearing a silver badge in the shape of what seemed to be a crown
[17855]2129    For some reason many of them waved at Ron, laughing uproariously
[17856]9078    Harry tried to see what was written on the badges as he walked by, but he was too concerned to get Ron past their table quickly to linger long enough to read them
[17857]8371   They received a rousing welcome at the Gryffindor table, where everyone was wearing red and gold, but far from raising Ron's spirits the cheers seemed to sap the last of his morale; he collapsed on to the nearest bench looking as though he were facing his final meal
[17858]5819   I must've been mental to do this,' he said in a croaky whisper
[17859]5    Mental
[17860]14421   'Don't be thick,' said Harry firmly, passing him a choice of cereals, you're going to be fine
[17861]4813    It's normal to be nervous
[17862]2487   'I'm rubbish,' croaked Ron
[17863]452    I'm lousy
[17864]2453    I can't play to save my life
[17865]88    What was I thinking
[17866]10857  'Get a grip,' said Harry sternly
[17867]6648    Look at that save you made with your foot the other day, even Fred and George said it was brilliant
[17868]8597   'Ron turned a tortured face to Harry
[17869]161   That was an accident,' he whispered miserably
[17870]3948    I didn't mean to do it-I slipped off my broom when none of you were looking and when I was trying to get back on I kicked the Quaffle by accident
[17871]19028   'Well,' said Harry, recovering quickly from this unpleasant surprise, a few more accidents like that and the game's in the bag, isn't it
[17872]2376  'Hermione and Ginny sat down opposite them wearing red and gold scarves, gloves and rosettes
[17873]168   How're you feeling
[17874]2971  ' Ginny asked Ron, who was now staring into the dregs of milk at the bottom of his empty cereal bowl as though seriously considering attempting to drown himself in them
[17875]16407   He's just nervous,' said Harry
[17876]12260   Well, that's a good sign, I never feel you perform as well in exams if you're not a bit nervous,' said Hermione heartily
[17877]5674   Hello,' said a vague and dreamy voice from behind them
[17878]6827    Harry looked up: Luna Lovegood had drifted over from the Ravenclaw table
[17879]7436    Many people were staring at her and a few were openly laughing and pointing; she had managed to procure a hat shaped like a life-size lion's head, which was perched precariously on her head
[17880]6074   I'm supporting Gryffindor,' said Luna, pointing unnecessarily at her hat
[17881]546    Look what it does 
[17882]0   
[17883]0   
[17884]658   'She reached up and tapped the hat with her wand
[17885]722    It opened its mouth wide and gave an extremely realistic roar that made everyone in the vicinity jump
[17886]7502   It's good, isn't it
[17887]5270  ' said Luna happily
[17888]4122    I wanted to have it chewing up a serpent to represent Slytherin, you know, but there wasn't time
[17889]0    Anyway 
[17890]0   
[17891]0   
[17892]369    good luck, Ronald
[17893]355  'She drifted away
[17894]5922    They had not quite recovered from the shock of Luna's hat before Angelina came hurrying towards them, accompanied by Katie and Alicia, whose eyebrows had mercifully been returned to normal by Madam Pomfrey
[17895]5879   When you're ready,' she said, we're going to go straight down to the pitch, check out conditions and change
[17896]6502   'We'll be there in a bit,' Harry assured her
[17897]8297    Ron's just got to have some breakfast
[17898]8455   'It became clear after ten minutes, however, that Ron was not capable of eating anything more and Harry thought it best to get him down to the changing rooms
[17899]13301    As they rose from the table, Hermione got up, too, and taking Harry's arm she drew him to one side
[17900]10213   Don't let Ron see what's on those Slytherins' badges,' she whispered urgently
[17901]10466   Harry looked questioningly at her, but she shook her head warningly; Ron had just ambled over to them, looking lost and desperate
[17902]9245   Good luck, Ron,' said Hermione, standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek
[17903]8948    And you, Harry -'Ron seemed to come to himself slightly as they walked back across the Great Hall
[17904]4175    He touched the spot on his face where Hermione had kissed him, looking puzzled, as though he was not quite sure what had just happened
[17905]11128    He seemed too distracted to notice much around him, but Harry cast a curious glance at the crown-shaped badges as they passed the Slytherin table, and this time he made out the words etched on to them:Weasley is our KingWith an unpleasant feeling that this could mean nothing good, he hurried Ron across the Entrance Hall, clown the stone steps and out into the icy air
[17906]394   The frosty grass crunched under their feet as they hurried down the sloping lawns towards the stadium
[17907]1067    There was no wind at all and the sky was a uniform pearly white, which meant that visibility would be good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the eyes
[17908]10266    Harry pointed out these encouraging factors to Ron as they walked, but he was not sure that Ron was listening
[17909]536   Angelina had changed already and was talking to the rest of the team when they entered
[17910]11917    Harry and Ron pulled on their robes (Ron attempted to do his up back-to-front for several minutes before Alicia took pity on him and went to help), then sat down to listen to the pre-match talk while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came pouring out of the castle towards the pitch
[17911]7131   OK, I've only just found out the final line-up for Slytherin,' said Angelina, consulting a piece of parchment
[17912]10268    Last year's Beaters, Derrick and Bole, have left, but it looks as though Montague's replaced them with the usual gorillas, rather than anyone who can fly particularly well
[17913]16809    They're two blokes called Crabbe and Goyle, I don't know much about them-'We do,' said Harry and Ron together
[17914]9873   Well, they don't look bright enough to tell one end of a broom from the other,' said Angelina, pocketing her parchment, but then I was always surprised Derrick and Bole managed to find their way on to the pitch without signposts
[17915]5900   ' Crabbe and Goyle are in the same mould,' Harry assured her
[17916]292   They could hear hundreds of footsteps mounting the banked benches of the spectators' stands
[17917]6384    Some people were singing, though Harry could not make out the words
[17918]7897    He was starting to feel nervous, but he knew his butterflies were as nothing compared to Ron's, who was clutching his stomach and staring straight ahead again, his jaw set and his complexion pale grey
[17919]11718   It's time,' said Angelina in a hushed voice, looking at her watch
[17920]59    C'mon everyone 
[17921]0   
[17922]0   
[17923]366    good luck
[17924]6829   'The team rose, shouldered their brooms and marched in single file out of the changing room and into the dazzling sunlight, A roar of sound greeted them in which Harry could still hear singing, though it was muffled by the cheers and whistles
[17925]476   The Slytherin team was standing waiting for them
[17926]202    They, too, were wearing those silver crown-shaped badges
[17927]1147    The new Captain, Montague, was built along the same lines as Dudley Dursley with massive forearms like hairy hams
[17928]591    Behind him lurked Crabbe and Goyle, almost as large, blinking stupidly in the sunlight, swinging their new Beaters' bats
[17929]1233    Malfoy stood to one side, the sunlight gleaming on his white-blond head
[17930]10871    He caught Harry's eye and smirked, tapping the crown-shaped badge on his chest
[17931]561   Captains, shake hands,' ordered the referee Madam Hooch, as Angelina and Montague reached each other
[17932]11897    Harry could tell that Montague was trying to crush Angelina's fingers, though she did not wince
[17933]24    Mount your brooms 
[17934]0   
[17935]0   
[17936]358   'Madam Hooch placed her whistle in her mouth and blew
[17937]121   The balls were released and the fourteen players shot upwards
[17938]8318    Out of the corner of his eye Harry saw Ron streak off towards the goalhoops
[17939]7038    Harry zoomed higher, dodging a Bludger, and set off on a wide lap of the pitch, gazing around for a glint of gold; on the other side of the stadium, Draco Malfoy was doing exactly the same
[17940]8316   And it's Johnson -Johnson with the Quaffle, what a player that girl is, I've been saying it for years but she still won't go out with me-'JORDAN
[17941]1085  ' yelled Professor McGonagall

[17947]7103  'And as Lee paused to listen, the song rose loud and clear from the sea of green and silver in the Slytherin section of the stands: Weasley cannot save a thing,He cannot block a single ring,That's why Slytherins all sing:Weasley is our King

[17957]8545    'Harry could not help himself: abandoning his search for the Snitch, he wheeled around to watch Ron, a lone figure at the far end of the pitch, hovering before the three goalhoops while the massive Warrington pelted towards him

[17990]896   'But twenty-nil was nothing, there was still time for Gryffindor to catch up or catch the Snitch

[18016]7177   The Snitch skirted the foot of one of the goalhoops and scooted off towards the other side of the stands; its change of direction suited Malfoy, who was nearer; Harry pulled his Firebolt around, he and Malfoy were now neck and neck

[18029]6216   A Bludger hit Harry squarely in the small of the back and he flew forwards off his broom
[18030]803    Luckily he was only five or six feet above the ground, having dived so low to catch the Snitch, but he was winded all the same as he landed flat on his back on the frozen pitch
[18031]10666    He heard Madam Hooch's shrill whistle, an uproar in the stands compounded of catcalls, angry yells and jeering, a thud, then Angelina's frantic voice
[18032]557   Are you all right
[18033]11824  'Course I am,' said Harry grimly, taking her hand and allowing her to pull him to his feet
[18034]290    Madam Hooch was zooming towards one of the Slytherin players above him, though he could not see who it was from this angle
[18035]13339   It was that thug Crabbe,' said Angelina angrily, he whacked the Bludger at you the moment he saw you'd got the Snitch-but we won, Harry, we won
[18036]7515  'Harry heard a snort from behind him and turned around, still holding the Snitch tightly in his hand: Draco Malfoy had landed close by

[18061]6726    Harry looked around for Madam Hooch, but she was still berating Crabbe for his illegal Bludger attack
[18062]24795   Or perhaps,' said Malfoy, leering as he backed away, you can remember what your mother's house stank like, Potter, and Weasley's pigsty reminds you of it-'Harry was not aware of releasing George, all he knew was that a second later both of them were sprinting towards Malfoy
[18063]13410    He had completely forgotten that all the teachers were watching: all he wanted to do was cause Malfoy as much pain as possible; with no time to draw out his wand, he merely drew back the fist clutching the Snitch and sank it as hard as he could into Malfoy's stomach-Harry
[18064]5732   HARRY
[18065]378   GEORGE
[18066]0   NO
[18067]1994  'He could hear girls' voices screaming, Malfoy yelling, George swearing, a whistle blowing and the bellowing of the crowd around him, but he did not care
[18068]141    Not until somebody in the vicinity yelled Impedimenta
[18069]1398  ' and he was knocked over backwards by the force of the spell, did he abandon the attempt to punch every inch of Malfoy he could reach
[18070]744   What do you think you're doing
[18071]6173  ' screamed Madam Hooch, as Harry leapt to his feet
[18072]1732    It seemed to have been her who had hit him with the Impediment Jinx; she was holding her whistle in one hand and a wand in the other; her broom lay abandoned several feet away
[18073]1662    Malfoy was curled up on the ground, whimpering and moaning, his nose bloody; George was sporting a swollen lip; Fred was still being forcibly restrained by the three Chasers, and Crabbe was cackling in the background
[18074]7450    I've never seen behaviour like it-back up to the castle, both of you, and straight to your Head of House's office
[18075]0   Go
[18076]0   Now
[18077]6744   'Harry and George turned on their heels and marched off the pitch, both panting, neither saying a word to the other
[18078]898    The howling and jeering of the crowd grew fainter and fainter until they reached the Entrance Hall, where they could hear nothing except the sound of their own footsteps
[18079]11916    Harry became aware that something was still struggling in his right hand, the knuckles of which he had bruised against Malfoy's jaw
[18080]5958    Looking down, he saw the Snitch's silver wings protruding from between his fingers, struggling for release
[18081]1972   They had barely reached the door of Professor McGonagalls office when she came marching along the corridor behind them
[18082]1258    She was wearing a Gryffindor scarf, but tore it from her throat with shaking hands as she strode towards them, looking livid
[18083]0   In
[18084]5731  ' she said furiously, pointing to the door
[18085]6188    Harry and George entered
[18086]836    She strode around behind her desk and faced them, quivering with rage as she threw the Gryffindor scarf aside on to the floor
[18087]0   Well
[18088]5086  ' she said
[18089]186    I have never seen such a disgraceful exhibition
[18090]0    Two on one
[18091]38   Explain yourselves
[18092]11271  'Malfoy provoked us,' said Harry stiffly
[18093]3   Provoked you
[18094]2031  ' shouted Professor McGonagall, slamming a fist on to her desk so that her tartan tin slid sideways off it and burst open, littering the floor with Ginger Newts
[18095]3899    He'd just lost, hadn't he
[18096]392   Of course he wanted to provoke you
[18097]5605   But what on earth he can have said that justified what you two-'He insulted my parents,' snarled George
[18098]10568    And Harry's mother
[18099]1131   'But instead of leaving it to Madam Hooch to sort out, you two decided to give an exhibition of Muggle duelling, did you
[18100]1040  ' bellowed Professor McGonagall
[18101]804    Have you any idea what you've-
[18102]68  'Hem, hem
[18103]6251   'Harry and George both wheeled round
[18104]7711    Dolores Umbridge was standing in the doorway wrapped in a green tweed cloak that greatly enhanced her resemblance to a giant toad, and was smiling in the horrible, sickly, ominous way that Harry had come to associate with imminent misery
[18105]1151   May I help, Professor McGonagall
[18106]2232  ' asked Professor Umbridge in her most poisonously sweet voice
[18107]6378   Blood rushed into Professor McGonagall's face
[18108]145   Help
[18109]595  ' she repeated, in a constricted voice
[18110]376    What do you mean, help
[18111]1806  'Professor Umbridge moved forwards into the office, still smiling her sickly smile
[18112]729   Why, I thought you might be grateful for a little extra authority
[18113]11589   'Harry would not have been surprised to see sparks fly from Professor McGonagall's nostrils
[18114]6211   You thought wrong,' she said, turning her back on Umbridge
[18115]314   Now, you two had better listen closely
[18116]5647    I do not care what provocation Malfoy offered you, I do not care if he insulted every family member you possess, your behaviour was disgusting and I am giving each of you a week's worth of detentions
[18117]1656   Do not look at me like that, Potter, you deserve it
[18118]68   And if either of you ever-'Hem, hem
[18119]3770   'Professor McGonagall closed her eyes as though praying for patience as she turned her face towards Professor Umbridge again
[18120]292   Yes
[18121]6313  'I think they deserve rather more than detentions,' said Umbridge, smiling still more broadly
[18122]6542   Professor McGonagall's eyes flew open
[18123]6511   But unfortunately,' she said, with an attempt at a reciprocal smile that made her look as though she had lockjaw, it is what I think that counts, as they are in my House, Dolores
[18124]3194   'Well, actually, Minerva,' simpered Professor Umbridge, I think you'll find that what I think does count
[18125]0    Now, where is it
[18126]924   Cornelius just sent it 
[18127]0   
[18128]0   
[18129]1770    I mean,' she gave a false little laugh as she rummaged in her handbag, the Minister just sent it 
[18130]0   
[18131]0   
[18132]343    ah yes 
[18133]0   
[18134]0   
[18135]5650   'She had pulled out a piece of parchment which she now unfurled, clearing her throat fussily before starting to read what it said

[18140]0   'Not another one
[18141]1018  ' exclaimed Professor McGonagall violently
[18142]6015   Well, yes,' said Umbridge, still smiling
[18143]225    As a matter of fact, Minerva, it was you who made me see that we needed a further amendment 
[18144]0   
[18145]0   
[18146]580    you remember how you overrode me, when I was unwilling to allow the Gryffindor Quidditch team to re-form
[18147]1260   How you took the case to Dumbledore, who insisted that the team be allowed to play
[18148]2437   Well, now, I couldn't have that
[18149]907    I contacted the Minister at once, and he quite agreed with me that the High Inquisitor has to have the power to strip pupils of privileges, or she-that is to say, I-would have less authority than common teachers
[18150]3969   And you see now, don't you, Minerva, how right I was in attempting to stop the Gryffindor team re-forming
[18151]23   Dreadful tempers 
[18152]0   
[18153]0   
[18154]57    anyway, I was reading out our amendment

[18158]0   
[18159]0   
[18160]702   the High Inquisitor will henceforth have supreme authority over all punishments, sanctions and removal of privileges pertaining to the students of Hogwarts, and the power to alter such punishments, sanctions and removals of privileges as may have been ordered by other staff members
[18161]849    Signed, Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic, Order of Merlin First Class, etc
[18162]0   , etc
[18163]223    'She rolled up the parchment and put it back into her handbag still smiling
[18164]0   So 
[18165]0   
[18166]0   
[18167]12845    I really think I will have to ban these two from playing Quidditch ever again,' she said, looking from Harry to George and back again
[18168]6438   Harry felt the Snitch fluttering madly in his hand
[18169]9   Ban us
[18170]5720  ' he said, and his voice sounded strangely distant
[18171]39    From playing 
[18172]0   
[18173]0   
[18174]0    ever again
[18175]664  'Yes, Mr
[18176]12055    Potter, I think a lifelong ban ought to do the trick,' said Umbridge, her smile widening still further as she watched him struggle to comprehend what she had said
[18177]372    You and Mr
[18178]636    Weasley here
[18179]6526    And I think, to be safe, this young man's twin ought to be stopped, too-if his teammates had not restrained him, I feel sure he would have attacked young Mr
[18180]440    Malfoy as well
[18181]1200    I will want their broomsticks confiscated, of course; I shall keep them safely in my office, to make sure there is no infringement of my ban
[18182]2533    But I am not unreasonable, Professor McGonagall,' she continued, turning back to Professor McGonagall who was now standing as still as though carved from ice, staring at her
[18183]618    The rest of the team can continue playing, I saw no signs of violence from any of them
[18184]0    Well 
[18185]0   
[18186]0   
[18187]382    good afternoon to you
[18188]1968   'And with a look of the utmost satisfaction, Umbridge left the room, leaving a horrified silence in her wake
[18189]6419   Banned,' said Angelina in a hollow voice, late that evening in the common room
[18190]10    Banned
[18191]23   No Seeker and no Beaters 
[18192]0   
[18193]0   
[18194]527    what on earth are we going to do
[18195]975  'It did not feel as though they had won the match at all
[18196]9114    Everywhere Harry looked there were disconsolate and angry faces; the team themselves were slumped around the fire, all apart from Ron, who had not been seen since the end of the match
[18197]10686   It's just so unfair,' said Alicia numbly
[18198]475    I mean, what about Crabbe and that Bludger he hit after the whistle had been blown
[18199]10   Has she banned him
[18200]12919  'No,' said Ginny miserably; she and Hermione were sitting on either side of Harry
[18201]1935    He just got lines, I heard Montague laughing about it at dinner
[18202]3140   'And banning Fred when he didn't even do anything
[18203]5200  ' said Alicia furiously, pummelling her knee with her fist
[18204]17503   It's not my fault I didn't,' said Fred, with a very ugly look on his face, I would've pounded the little scumbag to a pulp if you three hadn't been holding me back
[18205]6350   'Harry stared miserably at the dark window
[18206]63    Snow was falling
[18207]1740    The Snitch he had caught earlier was now zooming around and around the common room; people were watching its progress as though hypnotised and Crookshanks was leaping from chair to chair, trying to catch it
[18208]6763   I'm going to bed,' said Angelina, getting slowly to her feet
[18209]291    Maybe this will all turn out to have been a bad dream 
[18210]0   
[18211]0   
[18212]3161    maybe I'll wake up tomorrow and find we haven't played yet

[18215]262   'She was soon followed by Alicia and Katie
[18216]2674    Fred and George sloped off to bed some time later, glowering at everyone they passed, and Ginny went not long after that
[18217]7622    Only Harry and Hermione were left beside the fire
[18218]2185   Have you seen Ron
[18219]2597  ' Hermione asked in a low voice
[18220]6288   Harry shook his head
[18221]12021   I think he's avoiding us,' said Hermione
[18222]562    Where do you think he-
[18223]2857  'But at that precise moment, there was a creaking sound behind them as the Fat Lady swung forwards and Ron came clambering through the portrait hole
[18224]248    He was very pale indeed and there was snow in his hair
[18225]7892    When he saw Harry and Hermione, he stopped dead in his tracks
[18226]0   Where have you been
[18227]6740  ' said Hermione anxiously, springing up
[18228]2084   Walking,' Ron mumbled
[18229]355    He was still wearing his Quidditch things
[18230]7170   You look frozen,' said Hermione
[18231]479    Come and sit down
[18232]13405  'Ron walked to the fireside and sank into the chair furthest from Harry's, not looking at him
[18233]147    The stolen Snitch zoomed over their heads
[18234]3410   I'm sorry,' Ron mumbled, looking at his feet
[18235]0   What for
[18236]10818  ' said Harry
[18237]7346   For thinking I can play Quidditch,' said Ron
[18238]1161    I'm going to resign first thing tomorrow
[18239]11772   'If you resign,' said Harry testily, there'll only be three players left on the team
[18240]8562   ' And when Ron looked puzzled, he said, I've been given a lifetime ban
[18241]1499    So've Fred and George
[18242]0   'What
[18243]2011  ' Ron yelped
[18244]8080   Hermione told him the full story; Harry could not bear to tell it again
[18245]2754    When she had finished, Ron looked more anguished than ever
[18246]14285   This is all my fault-'You didn't make me punch Malfoy,' said Harry angrily
[18247]8074   - if I wasn't so terrible at Quidditch-'-it's got nothing to do with that
[18248]735   '-it was that song that wound me up-'-it would've wound anyone up
[18249]3156   'Hermione got up and walked to the window, away from the argument, watching the snow swirling down against the pane
[18250]478   Look, drop it, will you
[18251]5804  ' Harry burst out
[18252]4846    It's bad enough, without you blaming yourself for everything
[18253]7508  'Ron said nothing but sat gazing miserably at the damp hem of his robes
[18254]6743    After a while he said in a dull voice, This is the worst I've ever felt in my life
[18255]10887   'Join the club,' said Harry bitterly
[18256]7443   Well,' said Hermione, her voice trembling slightly
[18257]753    I can think of one thing that might cheer you both up
[18258]639   'Oh yeah
[18259]10823  ' said Harry sceptically
[18260]8539   Yeah,' said Hermione, turning away from the pitch-black, snow-flecked window, a broad smile spreading across her face

[18272]15091     Harry sprinted up to the boys' dormitories to fetch the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder's Map from his trunk; he was so quick that he and Ron were ready to leave at least five minutes before Hermione hurried back down from the girls' dormitories, wearing scarf, gloves and one of her own knobbly elf hats
[18273]4854   Well, it's cold out there
[18274]7172  ' she said defensively, as Ron clicked his tongue impatiently
[18275]3453   They crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the Cloak-Ron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showing-then, moving slowly and cautiously, they proceeded down the many staircases, pausing at intervals to check on the map for signs of Filch or Mrs
[18276]1    Morris
[18277]2119    They were lucky; they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick, who was gliding along absent-mindedly humming something that sounded horribly like Weasley is our King'
[18278]398    They crept across the Entrance Hall and out into the silent, snowy grounds
[18279]12403    With a great leap of his heart, Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from Hagrid's chimney
[18280]188    He set off at a quick march, the other two jostling and bumping along behind him
[18281]722    They crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door
[18282]6347    When Harry raised his fist and knocked three times, a dog started barking frantically inside
[18283]5402   Hagrid, it's us
[18284]5855  ' Harry called through the keyhole
[18285]43   Shoulda known
[18286]5626  ' said a gruff voice
[18287]6436   They beamed at each other under the Cloak; they could tell by Hagrid's voice that he was pleased
[18288]186    Bin home three seconds

[18297]6770   'The bolt was drawn back, the door creaked open and Hagrid's head appeared in the gap
[18298]1651   Hermione screamed
[18299]4788   Merlin's beard, keep it down
[18300]6049  ' said Hagrid hastily, staring wildly over their heads
[18301]215    Under that Cloak, are yeh
[18302]0   Well, get in, get in
[18303]536  'I'm sorry
[18304]2946  ' Hermione gasped, as the three of them squeezed past Hagrid into the house and pulled the Cloak off themselves so he could see them
[18305]1822    I just-oh, Hagrid
[18306]9508  'It's nuthin', it's nuthin'
[18307]8183  ' said Hagrid hastily, shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains, but Hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror
[18308]6422   Hagrid's hair was matted with congealed blood and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple and black bruising
[18309]6611    There were many cuts on his face and hands, some of them still bleeding, and he was moving gingerly, which made Harry suspect broken ribs
[18310]3388    It was obvious that he had only just got home: a thick black travelling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door
[18311]894    Hagrid himself, twice the size of a normal man, was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it
[18312]143   What happened to you
[18313]6114  ' Harry demanded, while Fang danced around them all, trying to lick their faces
[18314]6239   Told yeh, nuthin',' said Hagrid firmly
[18315]336    Want a cuppa
[18316]8098  'Come off it,' said Ron, you're in a right state
[18317]6932  'I'm tellin' yeh, I'm fine,' said Hagrid, straightening up and turning to beam at them all, but wincing
[18318]6529    Blimey, it's good ter see yeh three again-had good summers, did yeh
[18319]1403  'Hagrid, you've been attacked
[18320]7088  ' said Ron
[18321]5352   Fer the las' time, it's nuthin'
[18322]5783  ' said Hagrid firmly
[18323]1200   Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face
[18324]2031  ' Ron demanded
[18325]8084   You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid,' said Hermione anxiously, some of those cuts look nasty
[18326]467   'I'm dealin' with it, all righ
[18327]5741  ' said Hagrid repressively
[18328]872   He walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it
[18329]430    Underneath was a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tyre
[18330]1163   You're not going to eat that, are you, Hagrid
[18331]7612  ' said Ron, leaning in for a closer look
[18332]96    It looks poisonous
[18333]21362   'It's s'posed ter look like that, it's dragon meat,' Hagrid said
[18334]569    An' I didn' get it ter eat
[18335]846   'He picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face
[18336]417    Greenish blood trickled down into his beard as he gave a soft moan of satisfaction
[18337]4962   Tha's better
[18338]904    It helps with the stingin', yeh know
[18339]5714   'So, are you going to tell us what's happened to you
[18340]6088  ' Harry asked
[18341]8040   Can't, Harry
[18342]37    Top secret
[18343]5447    More'n me job's worth ter tell yeh that
[18344]1358   'Did the giants beat you up, Hagrid
[18345]2108  ' asked Hermione quietly
[18346]5668   Hagrid's fingers slipped on the dragon steak and it slid squelchily on to his chest
[18347]27   Giants
[18348]11572  ' said Hagrid, catching the steak before it reached his belt and slapping it back over his face, who said anythin' abou' giants
[18349]170   Who yeh bin talkin' to
[18350]16488   Who's told yeh what I've-who's said I've bin-eh
[18351]6720  'We guessed,' said Hermione apologetically
[18352]1956   Oh, yeh did, did yeh
[18353]5972  ' said Hagrid, surveying her sternly with the eye that was not hidden by the steak
[18354]87   It was kind of 
[18355]0   
[18356]0   
[18357]7104    obvious,' said Ron
[18358]5790    Harry nodded
[18359]1046   Hagrid glared at them, then snorted, threw the steak back on to the table and strode over to the kettle, which was now whistling
[18360]1165   Never known kids like you three fer knowin' more'n yeh oughta,' he muttered, splashing boiling water into three of his bucket-shaped mugs
[18361]572    An' I'm not complimentin' yeh, neither
[18362]622    Nosy, some'd call it
[18363]1    Interferin'
[18364]35   'But his beard twitched
[18365]484   So you have been to look for giants
[18366]11200  ' said Harry, grinning as he sat down at the table
[18367]1527   Hagrid set tea in front of each of them, sat down, picked up his steak again and slapped it back over his face
[18368]322   Yeah, all righ',' he grunted, I have
[18369]0   'And you found them
[18370]7254  ' said Hermione in a hushed voice
[18371]6090   Well, they're not that difficult ter find, ter be honest, said Hagrid
[18372]85    Pretty big, see
[18373]0   'Where are they
[18374]7088  ' said Ron
[18375]5751   Mountains,' said Hagrid unhelpfully
[18376]2989   So why don't Muggles-
[18377]5762  'They do,' said Hagrid darkly
[18378]229    On'y their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin' accidents, aren' they
[18379]415  'He adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising
[18380]2113   Come on, Hagrid, tell us what you've been up to
[18381]7088  ' said Ron
[18382]9577    Tell us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about being attacked by the dementors-'Hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time; a large quantity of spit, tea and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid, with a soft splat, on to the floor
[18383]503   Whadda yeh mean, attacked by dementors
[18384]684  ' growled Hagrid
[18385]3479   Didn't you know
[18386]2062  ' Hermione asked him, wide-eyed
[18387]6466   I don' know any thin' that's bin happenin' since I left
[18388]930    I was on a secret mission, wasn' I, didn' wan' owls followin' me all over the place-ruddy dementors
[18389]130   Yeh're not serious
[18390]1468  'Yeah, I am, they turned up in Little Whinging and attacked my cousin and me, and then the Ministry of Magic expelled me-'WHAT
[18391]422  '-and I had to go to a hearing and everything, but tell us about the giants first
[18392]43   'You were expelled
[18393]1295  'Tell us about your summer and I'll tell you about mine
[18394]1079   'Hagrid glared at him through his one open eye
[18395]7574    Harry looked right back, an expression of innocent determination on his face
[18396]6672   Oh, all righ',' Hagrid said in a resigned voice
[18397]5094   He bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fang's mouth
[18398]11269   Oh, Hagrid, don't, it's not hygien-' Hermione began, but Hagrid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye
[18399]5772   He took another fortifying gulp of tea, then said, Well, we set off righ' after term ended-'Madame Maxime went with you, then
[18400]1617  ' Hermione interjected
[18401]11664   Yeah, tha's righ',' said Hagrid, and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak
[18402]366    Yeah, it was jus' the pair of us
[18403]5826    An' I'll tell yeh this, she's not afraid of roughin' it, Olympe
[18404]6685    Yeh know, she's a fine, well-dressed woman, an' knowin' where we was goin' I wondered ow she'd feel abou' clamberin' over boulders an' sleepin' in caves an' tha', bu' she never complained once
[18405]767   'You knew where you were going
[18406]5785  ' Harry repeated
[18407]305    You knew where the giants were
[18408]6339  'Well, Durnbledore knew, an' he told us,' said Hagrid
[18409]40   Are they hidden
[18410]2358  ' asked Ron
[18411]37    Is it a secret, where they are
[18412]6619  'Not really,' said Hagrid, shaking his shaggy head
[18413]16196    It's jus' that mos' wizards aren' bothered where they are, s'long as it's a good long way away
[18414]10768    But where they are's very difficult ter get ter, fer humans anyway, so we needed Dumbledore's instructions
[18415]453    Took us abou' a month ter get there-'A month
[18416]8299  ' said Ron, as though he had never heard of a journey lasting such a ridiculously long time
[18417]3265    But-why couldn't you just grab a Portkey or something
[18418]7700  'There was an odd expression in Hagrid's unobscured eye as he surveyed Ron; it was almost pitying
[18419]7192   We're bein' watched, Ron,' he said gruffly
[18420]852   What d'you mean
[18421]6589  'Yeh don' understand,' said Hagrid
[18422]32994    The Ministry's keepin' an eye on Dumbledore an' anyone they reckon's in league with im, an'-'We know about that,' said Harry quickly, keen to hear the rest of Hagrid's story, we know about the Ministry watching Dumbledore-'So you couldn't use magic to get there
[18423]4130  ' asked Ron, looking thunderstruck, you had to act like Muggles all the way
[18424]6195  'Well, not exactly all the way,' said Hagrid cagily
[18425]2842    We jus' had ter be careful, cause Olympe an' me, we stick out a bit-'Ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea
[18426]353   -so we're not hard ter follow
[18427]7014    We was pretendin' we was goin' on holiday together, so we got inter France an' we made like we was headin' fer where Olympe's school is, cause we knew we was bein' tailed by someone from the Ministry
[18428]7419    We had to go slow, cause I'm not really s'posed ter use magic an' we knew the Ministry'd be lookin' fer a reason ter run us in
[18429]378    But we managed ter give the berk tailin' us the slip round abou' Dee-John-'Ooooh, Dijon
[18430]6728  ' said Hermione excitedly
[18431]1371    I've been there on holiday, did you see-
[18432]7930  'She fell silent at the look on Ron's face
[18433]777   We chanced a bit o' magic after that an' it wasn' a bad journey
[18434]2918    Ran inter a couple o' mad trolls on the Polish border an' I had a sligh' disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk, bu' apart from tha' couldn't'a bin smoother
[18435]572   An' then we reached the place, an' we started trekkin' up through the mountains, lookin' fer signs of em 
[18436]0   
[18437]0   
[18438]1220   We had ter lay off the magic once we got near em
[18439]4322    Partly cause they don' like wizards an' we didn' want ter put their backs up too soon, an' partly cause Dumbledore had warned us You-Know-Who was bound ter be after the giants an' all
[18440]5938    Said it was odds on he'd sent a messenger off ter them already
[18441]1729    Told us ter be very careful of drawin' attention ter ourselves as we got nearer in case there was Death Eaters around
[18442]1082   'Hagrid paused for a long draught of tea
[18443]0   Go on
[18444]10841  ' said Harry urgently
[18445]5786   Found em,' said Hagrid baldly
[18446]236    Went over a ridge one nigh' an' there they was, spread ou' underneath us
[18447]352    Little fires burnin' below an' huge shadows 
[18448]0   
[18449]0   
[18450]877    it was like watchin' bits o' the mountain movin'
[18451]57   'How big are they
[18452]2911  ' asked Ron in a hushed voice
[18453]5992   ' Bout twenty feet,' said Hagrid casually
[18454]188    Some o' the bigger ones mighta bin twenty-five
[18455]0   'And how many were there
[18456]6088  ' asked Harry
[18457]5814   I reckon abou' seventy or eighty,' said Hagrid
[18458]0   Is that all
[18459]6701  ' said Hermione
[18460]6171   Yep,' said Hagrid sadly, eighty left, an' there was loads once, musta bin a hundred diff'rent tribes from all over the world
[18461]802    Bu' they've bin dyin' out fer ages
[18462]527    Wizards killed a few, o' course, bu' mostly they killed each other, an' now they're dyin' out faster than ever
[18463]943    They're not made ter live bunched up together like tha'
[18464]7243    Dumbledore says it's our fault, it was the wizards who forced em to go an' made em live a good long way from us an' they had no choice bu' ter stick together fer their own protection
[18465]11144   'So,' said Harry, you saw them and then what
[18466]7179  'Well, we waited till morning, didn' want ter go sneakin' up on em in the dark, fer our own safety,' said Hagrid
[18467]214    ' Bout three in the mornin' they fell asleep jus' where they was sittin'
[18468]462    We didn' dare sleep
[18469]1304    Fer one thing, we wanted ter make sure none of em woke up an' came up where we were, an' fer another, the snorin' was unbelievable
[18470]80    Caused an avalanche near mornin'
[18471]337   Anyway once it was light we wen' down ter see em
[18472]1542   'Just like that
[18473]7700  ' said Ron, looking awestruck
[18474]1577    You just walked right into a giant camp
[18475]7645  'Well, Dumbledore'd told us how ter do it,' said Hagrid
[18476]928    Give the Gurg gifts, show some respect, yeh know
[18477]5   'Give the what gifts
[18478]6088  ' asked Harry
[18479]424   Oh, the Gurg- means the chief
[18480]344   'How could you tell which one was the Gurg
[18481]2358  ' asked Ron
[18482]674   Hagrid grunted in amusement
[18483]5116   No problem,' he said
[18484]9    He was the biggest, the ugliest and the laziest
[18485]226    Sittin' there waitin' ter be brought food by the others
[18486]827    Dead goats an' such like
[18487]122    Name o' Karkus
[18488]1171    I'd put him at twenty-two, twenty-three feet an' the weight o' a couple o' bull elephants
[18489]783    Skin like rhino hide an' all
[18490]964   'And you just walked up to him
[18491]6718  ' said Hermione breathlessly
[18492]0   Well 
[18493]0   
[18494]0   
[18495]153    down ter him, where he was lyin' in the valley
[18496]413    They was in this dip between four pretty high mountains, see, beside a mountain lake, an' Karkus was lyin' by the lake roarin' at the others ter feed him an' his wife
[18497]3411    Olympe an' I went down the mountainside-'But didn't they try and kill you when they saw you
[18498]2372  ' asked Ron incredulously
[18499]8669   It was def'nitely on some o' their minds,' said Hagrid, shrugging, but we did what Dumbledore told us ter do, which was ter hold our gift up high an' keep our eyes on the Gurg an' ignore the others
[18500]5446    So tha's what we did
[18501]2065    An' the rest of em went quiet an' watched us pass an' we got right up ter Karkuss leet an we bowed an' put our present down in front o' him
[18502]54   'What do you give a giant
[18503]2409  ' asked Ron eagerly
[18504]34    Food
[18505]5846  'Nah, he can get food all righ' fer himself,' said Hagrid
[18506]424    We took him magic
[18507]2417    Giants like magic, jus' don' like us usin' it against em
[18508]528    Anyway, that firs' day we gave im a branch o' Gubraithian fire
[18509]6710   'Hermione said, Wow
[18510]7789  ' softly, but Harry and Ron both frowned in puzzlement
[18511]11   A branch of-
[18512]7558  'Everlasting fire,' said Hermione irritably, you ought to know that by now
[18513]5722    Professor Flitwick's mentioned it at least twice in class
[18514]11020  'Well, anyway,' said Hagrid quickly, intervening before Ron could answer back, Dumbledore'd bewitched this branch to burn fer evermore, which isn' somethin' any wizard could do, an' so I lies it down in the snow by Karkuss feet and says, A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore, who sends his respectful greetings
[18515]948    'And what did Karkus say
[18516]6139  ' asked Harry eagerly
[18517]5742   Nothin',' said Hagrid
[18518]484    Didn' speak English
[18519]5   'You're kidding
[18520]7147  'Didn' matter,' said Hagrid imperturbably, Dumbledore had warned us tha' migh' happen
[18521]859    Karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o' giants who knew our lingo an' they translated fer us
[18522]1435   'And did he like the present
[18523]2358  ' asked Ron
[18524]6915   Oh yeah, it went down a storm once they understood what it was,' said Hagrid, turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler side to his swollen eye
[18525]59    Very pleased
[18526]6079    So then I said, Albus Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift
[18527]2674    ' Why couldn't you speak to them that day
[18528]1971  ' asked Hermione
[18529]6895   Dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow,' said Hagrid
[18530]480    Let em see we kept our promises
[18531]1925    We'll come back tomorrow with another present, an' then we do come back with another present-gives a good impression, see
[18532]5961   An' gives them time ter test out the firs' present an' fnd out it's a good one, an' get em eager fer more
[18533]1864    In any case, giants like Karkus-overload em with information an' they'll kill yeh jus' to simplify things
[18534]2120    So we bowed outta the way an' went off an' found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in an' the followin' mornin' we went back an' this time we found Karkus sittin' up waitin' fer us lookin' all eager
[18535]17   'And you talked to him
[18536]639  'Oh yeah
[18537]1154    Firs' we presented him with a nice battle helmet-goblin-made an' indestructible, yeh know-an' then we sat down an' we talked
[18538]937   'What did he say
[18539]5738  'Not much,' said Hagrid
[18540]18    Listened mostly
[18541]388    Bu' there were good signs
[18542]2860    He'd heard o' Dumbledore, heard he'd argued against the killin' o' the last giants in Britain
[18543]1586    Karkus seemed ter be quite int'rested in what Dumbledore had ter say
[18544]306    An' a few o' the others, specially the ones who had some English, they gathered round an' listened too
[18545]446    We were hopeful when we left that day
[18546]633    Promised ter come back next mornin' with another present
[18547]287   Bu' that night it all wen' wrong
[18548]852   'What d'you mean
[18549]7243  ' said Ron quickly
[18550]7009   Well, like I say, they're not meant ter live together, giants,' said Hagrid sadly
[18551]802    Not in big groups like that
[18552]441    They can' help themselves, they half kill each other every few weeks
[18553]5194    The men fight each other an' the women fight each other; the remnants of the old tribes fight each other, an' that's even without squabbles over food an' the best fires an' sleepin' spots
[18554]2130    Yeh'd think, seein' as how their whole race is abou' finished, they'd lay off each other, bu' 
[18555]0   
[18556]0   
[18557]712   ' Hagrid sighed deeply
[18558]791   That night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our cave, lookin' down on the valley
[18559]704    Went on fer hours, yeh wouldn' believe the noise
[18560]945    An' when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an' his head was lyin' at the bottom o' the lake
[18561]490   'Whose head
[18562]1655  ' gasped Hermione
[18563]10547   Karkus's,' said Hagrid heavily
[18564]162    There was a new Gurg, Golgomath
[18565]60   ' He sighed deeply
[18566]1663    Well, we hadn' bargained on a new Gurg two days after we'd made friendly contact with the firs' one, an' we had a funny feelin' Golgomath wouldn' be so keen ter listen to us, bu' we had ter try
[18567]274   'You went to speak to him
[18568]2372  ' asked Ron incredulously
[18569]6013    After you'd watched him rip off another giant's head
[18570]7429  'Course we did,' said Hagrid, we hadn' gone all that way ter give up after two days
[18571]1010   We wen' down with the next present we'd meant ter give ter Karkus
[18572]1251   I knew it was no go before I'd opened me mouth
[18573]5619    He was sitting there wearin' Karkus's helmet, leerin' at us as we got nearer
[18574]4923    He's massive, one o' the biggest ones there
[18575]613    Black hair an' matchin' teeth an' a necklace o' bones
[18576]137    Human-lookin' bones, some of em
[18577]6842    Well, I gave it a go-held out a great roll o' dragon skin-an' said, A gift fer the Gurg of the giants-' Nex' thing I knew, I was hangin' upside-down in the air by me feet, two of his mates had grabbed me
[18578]1993   'Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth
[18579]667   How did you get out of that
[18580]6088  ' asked Harry
[18581]5996   Wouldn'ta done if Olympe hadn' bin there,' said Hagrid
[18582]2240    She pulled out her wand an' did some o' the fastes' spellwork I've ever seen
[18583]13    Ruddy marvellous
[18584]7196    Hit the two holdin' me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus Curses an' they dropped me straightaway-'bu' we were in trouble then, cause we'd used magic against em, an' that's what giants hate abou' wizards
[18585]1741    We had ter leg it an' we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter the camp again
[18586]7894   'Blimey, Hagrid,' said Ron quietly
[18587]5772   So, how come it's taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days
[18588]1971  ' asked Hermione
[18589]598   We didn' leave after three days
[18590]6352  ' said Hagrid, looking outraged
[18591]818    Dumbledore was relyin' on us
[18592]6942  'But you've just said there was no way you could go back
[18593]135  'Not by daylight we couldn', no
[18594]1150    We just had ter rethink a bit
[18595]385    Spent a couple o' days lyin' low up in the cave an' watchin'
[18596]819    An' wha' we saw wasn' good
[18597]740   'Did he rip off more heads
[18598]2012  ' asked Hermione, sounding squeamish
[18599]5787   No,' said Hagrid, I wish he had
[18600]852   'What d'you mean
[18601]1773  'I mean we soon found out he didn' object ter all wizards-'just us
[18602]251   'Death Eaters
[18603]10973  ' said Harry quickly
[18604]5769   Yep,' said Hagrid darkly
[18605]623    Couple oi em were visitin' him ev'ry day, bringin' gifts ter the Gurg, an' he wasn' dangling them upside-down
[18606]1643   'How d'you know they were Death Eaters
[18607]7088  ' said Ron
[18608]756   Because I recognised one of em,' Hagrid growled
[18609]110    Macnair, remember him
[18610]330   Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak
[18611]5   Maniac, he is
[18612]56    Likes killin' as much as Golgomath; no wonder they were gettin' on so well
[18613]5596   'So Macnair's persuaded the giants to join You-Know-Who
[18614]6734  ' said Hermione desperately
[18615]339   Hold yer hippogriffs, I haven' finished me story yet
[18616]6471  ' said Hagrid indignantly, who, considering he had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place, now seemed to be rather enjoying himself
[18617]2970    Me an' Olympe talked it over an' we agreed, jus' cause the Gurg looked like favourin' You-Know-Who didn' mean all of em would
[18618]679    We had ter try an' persuade some o' the others, the ones who hadn' wanted Golgomath as Gurg
[18619]361   'How could you tell which ones they were
[18620]2358  ' asked Ron
[18621]88   Well, they were the ones bein' beaten to a pulp, weren' they
[18622]5742  ' said Hagrid patiently
[18623]5972    The ones with any sense were keepin' outta Golgomath's way, hidin' out in caves roun' the gully jus' like we were
[18624]1234    So we decided we'd go pokin' round the caves by night an' see if we couldn' persuade a few o' them
[18625]1162   'You went poking around dark caves looking for giants
[18626]7640  ' said Ron, with awed respect in his voice
[18627]5953   Well, it wasn' the giants who worried us most,' said Hagrid
[18628]284    We were more concerned abou' the Death Eaters
[18629]2111    Dumbledore had told us before we wen' not ter tangle with em if we could avoid it, an' the trouble was they knew we was around-'spect Golgomath told em abou' us
[18630]755    At night, when the giants were sleepin' an' we wanted ter be creepin' inter the caves, Macnair an' the other one were sneakin' round the mountains lookin' fer us
[18631]6594    I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin' out at em,' said Hagrid, the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard, she was rarin' ter attack em 
[18632]0   
[18633]0   
[18634]9514    she's somethin' when she's roused, Olympe 
[18635]0   
[18636]0   
[18637]911    fiery, yeh know 
[18638]0   
[18639]0   
[18640]4756   'spect it's the French in her 
[18641]0   
[18642]0   
[18643]711   'Hagrid gazed misty-eyed into the fire
[18644]6069    Harry allowed him thirty seconds of reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly
[18645]143   So, what happened
[18646]740   Did you ever get near any of the other giants
[18647]0  'What
[18648]362   Oh 
[18649]0   
[18650]0   
[18651]1306    oh, yeah, we did
[18652]2025    Yeah, on the third night after Karkus was killed we crept outta the cave we'd bin hidin' in an' headed back down inter the gully, keepin' our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters
[18653]1067    Got inside a few o' the caves, no go- then, in abou' the sixth one, we found three giants hidin'
[18654]7792   ' Cave must've been cramped,' said Ron
[18655]6478   Wasn' room ter swing a Kneazle,' said Hagrid
[18656]3099   Didn't they attack you when they saw you
[18657]1971  ' asked Hermione
[18658]12275   Probably woulda done if they'd bin in any condition,' said Hagrid, but they was badly hurt, all three o' them; Golgomath's lot had beaten em unconscious; they'd woken up an' crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find
[18659]1372    Anyway, one o' them had a bit of English an' e translated fer the others, an' what we had ter say didn' seem ter go down too badly
[18660]14    So we kep' goin' back, visitin' the wounded 
[18661]0   
[18662]0   
[18663]251    I reckon we had abou' six or seven o' them convinced at one poin'
[18664]46   'Six or seven
[18665]7139  ' said Ron eagerly
[18666]6635    Well that's not bad-are they going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us
[18667]7669  'But Hermione said, What do you mean at one point", Hagrid
[18668]1343  'Hagrid looked at her sadly
[18669]4860   Golgomath's lot raided the caves
[18670]620    The ones tha' survived didn' wan' no more ter to do with us after that
[18671]0   'So 
[18672]0   
[18673]0   
[18674]2494    so there aren't any giants coming
[18675]7709  ' said Ron, looking disappointed
[18676]14632   Nope,' said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak and applied the cooler side to his face, but we did wha' we meant ter do, we gave em Dumbledore's message an' some o' them heard it an' I spect some o' them'll remember it
[18677]12997    Jus' maybe, them that don' want ter stay around Golgomath'll move outta the mountains, an' there's gotta be a chance they'll remember Dumbledore's friendly to em 
[18678]0   
[18679]0   
[18680]1003    could be they'll come
[18681]206   'Snow was filling up the window now
[18682]17020    Harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through: Fang was drooling with his head in Harry's lap
[18683]652   Hagrid
[18684]6838  ' said Hermione quietly after a while
[18685]2   Mmm
[18686]667  'Did you

[18703]0    I 
[18704]0   
[18705]0   
[18706]787    forget it-'Dead,' Hagrid grunted
[18707]303    Died years ago

[18709]362   'Oh

[18713]0   
[18714]0   
[18715]8212    I'm really sorry,' said Hermione in a very small voice
[18716]730    Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders
[18717]5300   No need,' he said shortly
[18718]2413    Can't remember her much
[18719]484    Wasn' a great mother
[18720]56   'They were silent again
[18721]9556    Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron, plainly wanting them to speak
[18722]16843   But you still haven't explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,' Ron said, gesturing towards Hagrid's bloodstained face
[18723]10862   Or why you're back so late,' said Harry
[18724]1583    Sirius says Madame Maxime got back ages ago-'Who attacked you
[18725]7088  ' said Ron
[18726]224   I haven' bin attacked
[18727]5740  ' said Hagrid emphatically
[18728]761    I-'But the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door
[18729]2147    Hermione gasped; her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped
[18730]309    All four of them stared at the window beside the doorway
[18731]241    The shadow of somebody small and squat rippled across the thin curtain
[18732]4750   It's her
[18733]2125  ' Ron whispered
[18734]0   Get under here
[18735]15063  ' Harry said quickly, seizing the Invisibility Cloak, he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the table and dived under the Cloak as well
[18736]473    Huddled together, they backed away into a corner
[18737]588    Fang was barking madly at the door
[18738]1379    Hagrid looked thoroughly confused
[18739]672   Hagrid, hide our mugs
[18740]18052  'Hagrid seized Harry and Ron's mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fang's basket
[18741]2126    Fang was now leaping up at the door; Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open
[18742]1849   Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps
[18743]6182    Lips pursed, she leaned back so as to see Hagrid's face; she barely reached his navel
[18744]5450   So,' she said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to somebody deaf
[18745]652    You're Hagrid, are you
[18746]1165  'Without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room, her bulging eyes rolling in every direction
[18747]1059   Get away,' she snapped, waving her handbag at Fang, who had bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face
[18748]7180   Er-I don' want ter be rude,' said Hagrid, staring at her, but who the ruddy hell are you
[18749]602  'My name is Dolores Umbridge
[18750]545   'Her eyes were sweeping the cabin
[18751]9778    Twice they stared directly into the corner where Harry stood, sandwiched between Ron and Hermione
[18752]602   Dolores Umbridge
[18753]5829  ' Hagrid said, sounding thoroughly confused
[18754]1652    I thought you were one o' them Ministry-don' you work with Fudge
[18755]6511  'I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes,' said Umbridge, now pacing around the cabin, taking in every tiny detail within, from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned travelling cloak
[18756]16624    I am now the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher-'Tha's brave of yeh,' said Hagrid, there's not many'd take tha' job any more
[18757]6444   '-and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,' said Umbridge, giving no sign that she had heard him
[18758]4759   Wha's that
[18759]5779  ' said Hagrid, frowning
[18760]13048   Precisely what I was going to ask,' said Umbridge, pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermione's mug
[18761]16162   Oh,' said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance towards the corner where Harry, Ron and Hermione stood hidden, oh, tha' was 
[18762]0   
[18763]0   
[18764]71    was Fang
[18765]52    He broke a mug
[18766]319    So I had ter use this one instead
[18767]1335   'Hagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking, one hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye
[18768]968    Umbridge stood facing him now, taking in every detail of his appearance instead of the cabins
[18769]5539   I heard voices,' she said quietly
[18770]5961   I was talkin' ter Fang,' said Hagrid stoutly
[18771]144   And was he talking back to you
[18772]0  'Well 
[18773]0   
[18774]0   
[18775]6473    in a manner o' speakin',' said Hagrid, looking uncomfortable
[18776]11153    I sometimes say Fang's near enough human-'There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin,' said Umbridge sleekly
[18777]7946   Hermione gasped; Harry clapped a hand over her mouth
[18778]7430    Luckily, Fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of Professor Umbridge's robes and she did not appear to have heard
[18779]6910   Well, I on'y jus' got back,' said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand at the haversack
[18780]532    Maybe someone came ter call earlier an' I missed em
[18781]956   'There are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door
[18782]0   'Well, I

[18787]0   
[18788]15619   ' said Hagrid, tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing towards the corner where Harry, Ron and Hermione stood, as though asking for help
[18789]13    Erm 
[18790]0   
[18791]0   
[18792]1476   'Umbridge wheeled round and strode the length of the cabin, looking around carefully
[18793]236    She bent and peered under the bed
[18794]5574    She opened Hagrid's cupboards
[18795]15983    She passed within two inches of where Harry, Ron and Hermione stood pressed against the wall; Harry actually pulled in his stomach as she walked by
[18796]7047    After looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking, she wheeled round again and said, What has happened to you
[18797]681   How did you sustain those injuries
[18798]13224  'Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face, which in Harry's opinion was a mistake, because the black and purple bruising all around his eye was now clearly visible, not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face
[18799]362    Oh, I 
[18800]0   
[18801]0   
[18802]5295    had a bit of an accident,' he said lamely
[18803]83   What sort of accident
[18804]9  'I-I tripped
[18805]88   'You tripped,' she repeated coolly
[18806]5613   Yeah, tha's right

[18813]3043    Friend o' mine breeds Abraxan horses, I dunno if you ve ever seen em, big beasts, winged, yer know, I've had a bit of a ride on one o' them an' it was-'Where have you been
[18814]6366  ' asked Umbridge, cutting coolly through Hagrid's babbling
[18815]693   Where've I-
[18816]5378  'Been, yes,' she said
[18817]283    Term started two months ago
[18818]134    Another teacher has had to cover your classes
[18819]172    None of your colleagues has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts
[18820]280    You left no address
[18821]0    Where have you been
[18822]961  ' There was a pause in which Hagrid stared at her with his newly uncovered eye
[18823]6053    Harry could almost hear his brain working furiously
[18824]6127   I-I've been away for me health,' he said
[18825]1379   For your health,' repeated Professor Umbridge
[18826]6589    Her eyes travelled over Hagrid's discoloured and swollen face; dragon blood dripped gently and silently on to his waistcoat
[18827]0    I see
[18828]14162   'Yeah,' said Hagrid, bit o'-o' fresh air, yeh know-'Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by' said Umbridge sweetly
[18829]6388    The small patch of Hagrid's face that was not black or purple, flushed
[18830]1074   Well-change o' scene, yeh know-'Mountain scenery
[18831]5673  ' said Umbridge swiftly
[18832]6218   She knows, Harry thought desperately

[18835]161    Nope, South o' France fer me

[18838]0   
[18839]8    an' sea
[18840]288   'Really

[18842]2942    You don't have much of a tan
[18843]277   'Yeah

[18848]0   
[18849]5895    sensitive skin,' said Hagrid, attempting an ingratiating smile
[18850]5896    Harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked out
[18851]1382    Umbridge looked at him coldly; his smile faltered
[18852]5903    Then she hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said, I shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return
[18853]5787   'Righ',' said Hagrid, nodding
[18854]1086   You ought to know, too, that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers
[18855]136    So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough
[18856]910   'She turned sharply and marched back to the door
[18857]2   You're inspectin' us
[18858]1332  ' Hagrid repeated blankly, looking after her
[18859]7833   Oh, yes,' said Umbridge softly, looking back at him with her hand on the door handle
[18860]962    The Ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers, Hagrid
[18861]5    Goodnight
[18862]818   'She left, closing the door behind her with a snap
[18863]7572    Harry made to pull off the Invisibility Cloak but Hermione seized his wrist
[18864]83   Not yet,' she breathed in his ear
[18865]129    She might not be gone yet
[18866]1760   'Hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way; he stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so
[18867]10730   She's goin' back ter the castle,' he said in a low voice
[18868]17    Blimey

[18876]9   'Um

[18878]0   
[18879]1077    what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class, Hagrid
[18880]1971  ' asked Hermione
[18881]9055   Oh, don' you worry abou' that, I've got a great load o' lessons planned,' said Hagrid enthusiastically, scooping up his dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his eye again
[18882]1715    I've bin keepin' a couple o' creatures saved fer yer OWL year; you wait, they're somethin' really special
[18883]13   'Erm 
[18884]0   
[18885]0   
[18886]378    special in what way
[18887]1983  ' asked Hermione tentatively
[18888]6222   I'm not sayin',' said Hagrid happily
[18889]1158    I don' want ter spoil the surprise
[18890]16659   ' Look, Hagrid,' said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretence, Professor Umbridge won't be at all happy if you bring anything to class that's too dangerous
[18891]47   'Dangerous
[18892]6352  ' said Hagrid, looking genially bemused
[18893]944    Don' be silly, I wouldn' give yeh anythin' dangerous
[18894]10544   I mean, all righ', they can look after themselves-'Hagrid, you've got to pass Umbridge's inspection, and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after Porlocks, how to tell the difference between Knarls and hedgehogs, stuff like that
[18895]6710  ' said Hermione earnestly
[18896]12133   But tha's not very interestin', Hermione,' said Hagrid
[18897]6215    The stuff I've got's much more impressive
[18898]2444    I've bin bringin' em on fer years, I reckon I've got the on'y domestic herd in Britain
[18899]652   'Hagrid

[18905]7357   ' said Hermione, a note of real desperation in her voice
[18906]2251    Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore
[18907]6040    Please, Hagrid, teach us something dull that's bound to come up in our OWL
[18908]1522   'But Hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a one-eyed look of longing towards the vast bed in the corner
[18909]17964   Lis'en, it's bin a long day an' it's late,' he said, patting Hermione gently on the shoulder, so that her knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud
[18910]843    Oh-sorry-' He pulled her back up by the neck of her robes
[18911]3917    Look, don' you go worryin' abou' me, I promise yeh I've got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I'm back

[18915]10455  'I dunno if you got through to him,' said Ron a short while later when, having checked that the coast was clear, they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace behind them due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they went
[18916]7315   Then I'll go back again tomorrow,' said Hermione determinedly
[18917]654    I'll plan his lessons for him if I have to
[18918]8653    I don't care if she throws out Trelawney but she's not getting rid of Hagrid

[18926]7804     Hermione ploughed her way back to Hagrid's cabin through two feet of snow on Sunday morning
[18927]9676    Harry and Ron wanted to go with her, but their mountain of homework had reached an alarming height again, so they remained grudgingly in the common room, Tying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside, where students were enjoying themselves skating on the frozen lake, tobogganing and, worst of all, bewitching snowballs to zoom up to Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows
[18928]5   Oi
[18929]3032  ' bellowed Ron, finally losing patience and sticking his head out of the window, I am a prefect and if one more snowball hits this window-OUCH
[18930]1174  'He withdrew his head sharply, his face covered in snow
[18931]10830   It's Fred and George,' he said bitterly, slamming the window behind him

[18935]8309   'Hermione returned from Hagrid's just before lunch, shivering slightly, her robes damp to the knees
[18936]0   So
[18937]7771  ' said Ron, looking up when she entered
[18938]758    Got all his lessons planned for him
[18939]11100  'Well, I tried,' she said dully, sinking into a chair beside Harry
[18940]1732    She pulled out her wand and gave it a complicated little wave so that hot air streamed out of the tip; she then pointed this at her robes, which began to steam as they dried out
[18941]2783    He wasn't even there when I arrived, I was knocking for at least half an hour
[18942]6084    And then he came stumping out of the Forest-' Harry groaned
[18943]965    The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of creatures most likely to get Hagrid the sack
[18944]4791    What's he keeping in there
[18945]937   Did he say
[18946]356  ' he asked
[18947]6726   No,' said Hermione miserably
[18948]165    He says he wants them to be a surprise
[18949]3962    I tried to explain about Umbridge, but he just doesn't get it
[18950]33613    He kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study Knarls than Chimaeras-oh, I don't think he's got a Chimaera,' she added at the appalled look on Harry and Ron's faces, but that's not for lack of trying, from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs
[18951]18600    I don't know how many times I told him he'd be better off following Grubbly-Plank's plan, I honestly don't think he listened to half of what I said
[18952]5800    He's in a bit of a funny mood, you know
[18953]3417    He still won't say how he got all those injuries
[18954]6030   'Hagrid's reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was not greeted by enthusiasm from all students
[18955]8795    Some, like Fred, George and Lee, roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to wring Hagrid's enormous hand; others, like Parvati and Lavender, exchanged gloomy looks and shook their heads
[18956]13421    Harry knew that many of them preferred Professor Grubbly-Planks lessons, and the worst of it was that a very small, unbiased part of him knew that they had good reason: Grubbly-Plank's idea of an interesting class was not one where there was a risk that somebody might have their head ripped off
[18957]14995   It was with a certain amount of apprehension that Harry, Ron and Hermione headed down to Hagrid's on Tuesday, heavily muffled against the cold
[18958]7957    Harry was worried, not only about what Hagrid might have decided to teach them, but also about how the rest of the class, particularly Malfoy and his cronies, would behave if Umbridge was watching them
[18959]1417   However, the High Inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they struggled through the snow towards Hagrid, who stood waiting for them on the edge of the Forest
[18960]1177    He did not present a reassuring sight; the bruises that had been purple on Saturday night were now tinged with green and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding
[18961]6586    Harry could not understand this: had Hagrid perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from healing
[18962]2582   As though to complete the ominous picture, Hagrid was carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder
[18963]65   We're workin' in here today
[18964]1850  ' Hagrid called happily to the approaching students, jerking his head back at the dark trees behind him
[18965]197    Bit more sheltered
[18966]320   Anyway, they prefer the dark
[18967]313   'What prefers the dark
[18968]7496  ' Harry heard Malfoy say sharply to Crabbe and Goyle, a trace of panic in his voice
[18969]2106    What did he say prefers the dark-did you hear
[18970]6430  'Harry remembered the only other occasion on which Malfoy had entered the Forest before now; he had not been very brave then, either
[18971]1254    He smiled to himself; after the Quidditch match anything that caused Malfoy discomfort was all right with him
[18972]80   Ready
[18973]6496  ' said Hagrid cheerfully, looking around at the class
[18974]1693    Right, well, I've bin savin' a trip inter the Forest fer yer fifth year
[18975]1067    Thought we'd go an' see these creatures in their natural habitat
[18976]5810    Now, what we're studyin' today is pretty rare, I reckon I'm probably the on'y person in Britain who's managed ter train em
[18977]237   'And you're sure they're trained, are you
[18978]6094  ' said Malfoy, the panic in his voice even more pronounced
[18979]3866    Only it wouldn't be the first time you'd brought wild stuff to class, would it
[18980]1696  'The Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked as though they thought Malfoy had a fair point, too
[18981]6499   Course they're trained,' said Hagrid, scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his shoulder
[18982]664   So what happened to your face, then
[18983]469  ' demanded Malfoy
[18984]211   Mind yer own business
[18985]5821  ' said Hagrid, angrily
[18986]1041    Now, if yeh've finished askin' stupid questions, follow me
[18987]582  'He turned and strode straight into the Forest
[18988]36    Nobody seemed much disposed to follow
[18989]10563    Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, who sighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after Hagrid, leading the rest of the class
[18990]1325   They walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow at all on the ground
[18991]2625    With a grunt, Hagrid deposited his half a cow on the ground, stepped back and turned to face his class, most of whom were creeping from tree to tree towards him, peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at any moment
[18992]676   Gather roun', gather roun',' Hagrid encouraged
[18993]8837    Now, they'll be attracted by the smell o the meat but I'm going ter give em a call anyway, cause they'll like ter know it's me
[18994]3057   'He turned, shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face and gave an odd, shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some monstrous bird
[18995]1065    Nobody laughed: most of them looked too scared to make a sound
[18996]893   Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again
[18997]661    A minute passed in which the class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming
[18998]9167    And then, as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third lime and expanded his enormous chest, Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees
[18999]2425   A pair of blank, white, shining eyes were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face, neck and then skeletal body of a great, black, winged horse emerged from the darkness
[19000]1700    It surveyed the class for a few seconds, swishing its long black tail, then bowed its head and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with its pointed fangs
[19001]6085   A great wave of relief broke over Harry
[19002]1064    Here at last was proof that he had not imagined these creatures, that they were real: Hagrid knew about them too
[19003]8244    He looked eagerly at Ron, but Ron was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, Why doesn't Hagrid call again
[19004]7628  'Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as Ron's and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them
[19005]4277    There were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face; and Neville, whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail
[19006]378   Oh, an' here comes another one
[19007]7316  ' said Hagrid proudly, as a second black horse appeared out of the dark trees, folded its leathery-wings closer to its body and dipped its head to gorge on the meat
[19008]0    Now 
[19009]0   
[19010]0   
[19011]243    put yer hands up, who can see em
[19012]7006  'Immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the mystery of these horses, Harry raised his hand
[19013]710    Hagrid nodded at him
[19014]277   Yeah 
[19015]0   
[19016]0   
[19017]12300    yeah, I knew you'd be able ter, Harry,' he said seriously
[19018]334    An' you too, Neville, eh
[19019]6336   An'-'Excuse me,' said Malfoy in a sneering voice, but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing
[19020]929  'For an answer, Hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground
[19021]747    The whole class stared at it for a few seconds, then several people gasped and Parvati squealed
[19022]6871    Harry understood why: bits of flesh stripping themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air had to look very odd indeed
[19023]4932   What's doing it
[19024]742  ' Parvati demanded in a terrified voice, retreating behind the nearest tree
[19025]4776    What's eating it
[19026]8012  'Thestrals,' said Hagrid proudly and Hermione gave a soft Oh
[19027]10601  ' of comprehension at Harry's shoulder
[19028]984    Hogwarts has got a whole herd of em in here
[19029]65    Now, who knows -
[19030]579  'But they're really, really unlucky
[19031]691  ' interrupted Parvati, looking alarmed
[19032]500    They're supposed to bring all sorts of horrible misfortune on people who see them
[19033]11895    Professor Trelawney told me once-'No, no, no,' said Hagrid, chuckling, tha's jus' superstition, that is, they aren' unlucky, they're dead clever an' useful
[19034]25689   Course, this lot don' get a lot o' work, it's mainly jus' pullin' the school carriages unless Dumbledore's takin' a long journey an' don' want ter Apparate-an' here's another couple, look-'Two more horses came quietly out of the trees, one of them passing very close to Parvati, who shivered and pressed herself closer to the tree, saying, I think I felt something, I think it's near me
[19035]6747  'Don' worry, it won' hurt yeh,' said Hagrid patiently
[19036]2952    Righ', now, who can tell me why some o' yeh can see em an' some can't
[19037]2093  'Hermione raised her hand
[19038]5779   Go on then,' said Hagrid, beaming at her
[19039]6089   The only people who can see Thestrals,' she said, are people who have seen death
[19040]11568   'Tha's exactly right,' said Hagrid solemnly, ten points ter Gryffindor
[19041]95    Now, Thestrals-'Hem, hem
[19042]1388   'Professor Umbridge had arrived
[19043]6926    She was standing a few feet away from Harry, wearing her green hat and cloak again, her clipboard at the ready
[19044]652    Hagrid
[19045]5850    who had never heard Umbridge's fake cough before, was gazing in some concern at the closest Thestral, evidently under the impression that it had made the sound
[19046]68   Hem, hem
[19047]398   'Oh, hello
[19048]5995  ' Hagrid said, smiling, having located the source of the noise
[19049]304   You received the note I sent to your cabin this morning
[19050]6469  ' said Umbridge, in the same loud, slow voice she had used with him earlier, as though she were addressing somebody both foreign and very slow
[19051]161    Telling you that I would be inspecting your lesson
[19052]6416  'Oh, yeah,' said Hagrid brightly
[19053]365    Glad yeh found the place all righ'
[19054]44   Well, as you can see- or, I dunno-can you
[19055]633   We're doin' Thestrals today-'I'm sorry

[19147]1774   Hagrid stared at her, clearly at a complete loss to understand why she was acting as though he did not understand normal English

[19238]4188    Well, Hagrid,' she turned to look up at him again, speaking once more in that loud, slow voice, I think I've got enough to be getting along with

[19242]2513  ' stormed Hermione half an hour later, as they made their way back up to the castle through the channels they had made earlier in the snow
[19243]4750    You see what she's up to
[19244]27003   It's her thing about half-breeds all over again-she's trying to make out Hagrid's some kind of dimwitted troll, just because he had a giantess for a mother-and oh, it's not fair, that really wasn't a bad lesson at all-I mean, all right, if it had been Blast-Ended Skrewts again, but Thestrals are fine-in fact, for Hagrid, they're really good
[19245]12792  'Umbridge said they're dangerous,' said Ron
[19246]24261   Well, it's like Hagrid said, they can look after themselves,' said Hermione impatiently, and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank wouldn't usually show them to us before NEWT level, but, well, they are very interesting, aren't they
[19247]2975   The way some people can see them and some can't
[19248]49   I wish I could

[19251]784   She looked suddenly horrorstruck
[19252]10602   Oh, Harry-I'm sorry-no, of course I don't-that was a really stupid thing to say
[19253]20942   'It's OK,' he said quickly, don't worry'I'm surprised so many people could see them,' said Ron
[19254]7531    Three in a class-'Yeah, Weasley, we were just wondering,' said a malicious voice
[19255]1247    Unheard by any of them in the muffling snow, Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle were walking along right behind them
[19256]1966    D'you reckon if you saw someone snuff it you'd be able to see the Quaffle better
[19257]1653  'He, Crabbe and Goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on their way to the castle, then broke into a chorus of Weasley is our King'
[19258]7205    Ron's ears turned scarlet
[19259]3303   Ignore them, just ignore them,' intoned Hermione, pulling out her wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again, so that she could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow between them and the greenhouses
[19260]396   December arrived, bringing with it more snow and a positive avalanche of homework for the fifth-years
[19261]8523    Ron and Hermione's prefect duties also became more and more onerous as Christmas approached
[19262]33179    They were called upon to supervise the decoration of the castle ('You try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got the other end and is trying to strangle you with it,' said Ron), to watch over first- and second-years spending their break-times inside because of the bitter cold ('And they're cheeky little snot-rags, you know, we definitely weren't that rude when we were in first year,' said Ron) and to patrol the corridors in shifts with Argus Filch, who suspected that the holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels ('He's got dung for brains, that one,' said Ron furiously)
[19263]1907    They were so busy that Hermione had even stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that she was down to her last three
[19264]5314   All those poor elves I haven't set free yet, having to stay here over Christmas because there aren't enough hats
[19265]6823  'Harry, who had not had the heart to tell her that Dobby was taking everything she made, bent lower over his History of Magic essay
[19266]1693    In any case, he did not want to think about Christmas
[19267]1598    For the first time in his school career, he very much wanted to spend the holidays away from Hogwarts
[19268]2116    Between his Quidditch ban and worry about whether or not Hagrid was going to be put on probation, he felt highly resentful towards the place at the moment
[19269]2209    The only thing he really looked forward to were the DA meetings, and they would have to stop over the holidays, as nearly everybody in the DA would be spending the time with their families
[19270]4854    Hermione was going skiing with her parents, something that greatly amused Ron, who had never heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood on to their feet to slide down mountains
[19271]2582    Ron was going home to The Burrow
[19272]19407    Harry endured several days of envy before Ron said, in response to Harry asking him how he was going to get home for Christmas: But you're coming too
[19273]2978   Didn't I say
[19274]544   Mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks ago
[19275]24788  'Hermione rolled her eyes, but Harry's spirits soared: the thought of Christmas at The Burrow was truly wonderful, though slightly marred by Harry's guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday with Sirius
[19276]442    He wondered whether he could possibly persuade Mrs
[19277]661    Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities
[19278]2895    Even though he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit Sirius to leave Grimmauld Place anyway, he could not help but think Mrs
[19279]972    Weasley might not want him; they were so often at loggerheads
[19280]21171    Sirius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire, and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him, he did not like to think of Sirius alone in his mother's old house, perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher
[19281]7427   Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last DA meeting before the holidays and was very glad he had, because when the torches burst into flame he saw that Dobby had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for Christmas
[19282]17468    He could tell the elf had done it, because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles from the ceiling, each showing a picture of Harry's face and bearing the legend: HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS
[19283]8307  'Harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door creaked open and Luna Lovegood entered, looking as dreamy as usual
[19284]5795   Hello,' she said vaguely, looking around at what remained of the decorations
[19285]723    These are nice, did you put them up
[19286]11339  'No,' said Harry, it was Dobby the house-elf
[19287]16644   'Mistletoe,' said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over Harry's head
[19288]45    He jumped out from under it
[19289]5694    Good thinking,' said Luna very seriously
[19290]4755    It's often infested with Nargles
[19291]5963   'Harry was saved the necessity of asking what Nargles are by the arrival of Angelina, Katie and Alicia
[19292]787    All three of them were breathless and looked very cold
[19293]6259   Well,' said Angelina dully, pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a corner, we've finally replaced you
[19294]18   'Replaced me
[19295]10840  ' said Harry blankly
[19296]5937   You and Fred and George,' she said impatiently
[19297]1398    We've got another Seeker
[19298]0  ' Who
[19299]10973  ' said Harry quickly
[19300]6092   Ginny Weasley,' said Katie
[19301]5740   Harry gaped at her
[19302]11987   Yeah, I know,' said Angelina, pulling out her wand and flexing her arm, but she's pretty good, actually
[19303]8134    Nothing on you, of course,' she said, throwing him a very dirty look, but as we can't have you 
[19304]0   
[19305]0   
[19306]8311   'Harry bit back the retort he was longing to utter: did she imagine for a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hundred times more than she did
[19307]8  And what about the Beaters
[19308]1128   he asked, trying to keep his voice even
[19309]5142   Andrew Kirke,' said Alicia without enthusiasm, and Jack Sloper
[19310]483    Neither of them are brilliant, but compared to the rest of the idiots who turned up 
[19311]0   
[19312]0   
[19313]15502   ' The arrival of Ron, Hermione and Neville brought this depressing discussion to an end, and within five minutes the room was full enough to prevent Harry seeing Angelina's burning, reproachful looks
[19314]5341   OK,' he said, calling them all to order
[19315]13088    I thought this evening we should just go over the things we've done so far, because it's the last meeting before the holidays and there's no point starting anything new right before a three-week break-'We're not doing anything new
[19316]5726  ' said Zacharias Smith, in a disgruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room
[19317]3520    If I'd known that, I wouldn't have come
[19318]14805   'We're all really sorry Harry didn't tell you, then,' said Fred loudly
[19319]323   Several people sniggered
[19320]7233    Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in his stomach, as though he had missed a step going downstairs
[19321]10851   -we can practise in pairs,' said Harry
[19322]888    We'll start with the Impediment Jinx, for ten minutes, then we can get out the cushions and try Stunning again
[19323]6140   ' They all divided up obediently; Harry partnered Neville as usual
[19324]533    The room was soon full of intermittent cries of Impedimenta
[19325]1182  ' People froze for a minute or so, during which their partner would stare aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work, then would unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx
[19326]315   Neville had improved beyond all recognition
[19327]10383    After a while, when Harry had unfrozen three times in a row, he had Neville join Ron and Hermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the others
[19328]567    When he passed Cho she beamed at him; he resisted the temptation to walk past her several more times
[19329]580   After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx, they laid out cushions all over the floor and started practising Stunning again
[19330]721    Space was really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once; half the group observed the others for a while, then swapped over
[19331]6138   Harry felt himself positively swelling with pride as he watched them all
[19332]1440    True, Neville did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean, at whom he had been aiming, but it was a much closer miss than usual, and everybody else had made enormous progress
[19333]6173   At the end of an hour, Harry called a halt
[19334]5871   You're getting really good,' he said, beaming around at them
[19335]496    When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the big stuff-maybe even Patronuses
[19336]34   'There was a murmur of excitement
[19337]7116    The room began to clear in the usual twos and threes; most people wished Harry a Happy Christmas' as they went
[19338]4172    Feeling cheerful, he collected up the cushions with Ron and Hermione and stacked them neatly away
[19339]5139    Ron and Hermione left before he did; he hung back a little, because Cho was still there and he was hoping to receive a Merry Christmas' from her
[19340]5733   No, you go on,' he heard her say to her friend Marietta and his heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his Adam's apple
[19341]59   He pretended to be straightening the cushion pile
[19342]523    He was quite sure they were alone now and waited for her to speak
[19343]354    Instead, he heard a hearty sniff
[19344]2042   He turned and saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears pouring down her face
[19345]9   Wha-
[19346]3479  'He didn't know what to do
[19347]230    She was simply standing there, crying silently
[19348]4750   What's up
[19349]5096  ' he said, feebly
[19350]1062   She shook her head and wiped her eyes on her sleeve
[19351]5634   I'm-sorry,' she said thickly
[19352]63    I suppose 
[19353]0   
[19354]0   
[19355]5558    it's just 
[19356]0   
[19357]0   
[19358]86    learning all this stuff 
[19359]0   
[19360]0   
[19361]835    it just makes me 
[19362]0   
[19363]0   
[19364]30    wonder whether 
[19365]0   
[19366]0   
[19367]663    if he'd known it all 
[19368]0   
[19369]0   
[19370]664    he'd still be alive
[19371]11482   'Harry's heart sank right back past its usual spot and settled somewhere around his navel
[19372]104    He ought to have known
[19373]335    She wanted to talk about Cedric
[19374]12374   He did know this stuff,' Harry said heavily
[19375]1390    He was really good at it, or he could never have got to the middle of that maze
[19376]3706    But if Voldemort really wants to kill you, you don't stand a chance
[19377]10941   'She hiccoughed at the sound of Voldemort's name, but stared at Harry without flinching
[19378]6065   You survived when you were just a baby,' she said quietly
[19379]16597   Yeah, well,' said Harry wearily, moving towards the door, I dunno why, nor does anyone else, so it's nothing to be proud of
[19380]3303   'Oh, don't go
[19381]5279  ' said Cho, sounding tearful again
[19382]1577    I'm really sorry to get all upset like this 
[19383]0   
[19384]0   
[19385]2939    I didn't mean to 
[19386]0   
[19387]0   
[19388]2   'She hiccoughed again
[19389]603    She was very pretty even when her eyes were red and puffy
[19390]6056    Harry felt thoroughly miserable
[19391]1561    He'd have been so pleased with just a Merry Christmas'
[19392]6413   I know it must be horrible for you,' she said, mopping her eyes on her sleeve again
[19393]394    Me mentioning Cedric, when you saw him die 
[19394]0   
[19395]0   
[19396]1230    I suppose you just want to forget about it
[19397]7294  'Harry did not say anything to this; it was quite true, but he felt heartless saying it
[19398]6823   You're a r-really good teacher, you know,' said Cho, with a watery smile
[19399]826    I've never been able to Stun anything before
[19400]10867   'Thanks,' said Harry awkwardly
[19401]1294   They looked at each other for a long moment
[19402]7387    Harry felt a burning desire to run from the room and, at the same time, a complete inability to move his feet
[19403]6039   Mistletoe,' said Cho quietly, pointing at the ceiling over his head
[19404]11095   Yeah,' said Harry
[19405]201    His mouth was very dry
[19406]4821    It's probably full of Nargles, though
[19407]4   'What are Nargles
[19408]10929  'No idea,' said Harry
[19409]119    She had moved closer
[19410]69    His brain seemed to have been Stunned
[19411]739    You'd have to ask Loony
[19412]375    Luna, I mean
[19413]381   'Cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh
[19414]38    She was even nearer to him now
[19415]121    He could have counted the freckles on her nose
[19416]6754   I really like you, Harry
[19417]562   'He could not think
[19418]241    A tingling sensation was spreading through him, paralysing his arms, legs and brain
[19419]98   She was much too close
[19420]17    He could see every tear clinging to her eyelashes 
[19421]0   
[19422]0   
[19423]5187   He returned to the common room half an hour later to find Hermione and Ron in the best seats by the fire; nearly everybody else had gone to bed
[19424]2721    Hermione was writing a very long letter; she had already filled half a roll of parchment, which was dangling from the edge of the table
[19425]2448    Ron was lying on the hearthrug, trying to finish his Transfiguration homework
[19426]113   What kept you
[19427]12516  ' he asked, as Harry sank into the armchair next to Hermione's
[19428]8513   Harry didn't answer
[19429]51    He was in a state of shock
[19430]5638    Half of him wanted to tell Ron and Hermione what had just happened, but the other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave
[19431]6289   Are you all right, Harry
[19432]2094  ' Hermione asked, peering at him over the tip of her quill
[19433]6139   Harry gave a half-hearted shrug
[19434]4077    In truth, he didn't know whether he was all right or not
[19435]4750    What's up
[19436]12887  ' said Ron, hoisting himself up on his elbow to get a clearer view of Harry
[19437]4893    What's happened
[19438]12475  'Harry didn't quite know how to set about telling them, and still wasn't sure whether he wanted to
[19439]3132    Just as he had decided not to say anything, Hermione took matters out of his hands
[19440]150   Is it Cho
[19441]714  ' she asked in a businesslike way
[19442]831    Did she corner you after the meeting
[19443]5836  'Numbly surprised, Harry nodded
[19444]3905    Ron sniggered, breaking off when Hermione caught his eye
[19445]1123   So-er-what did she want
[19446]907  ' he asked in a mock casual voice
[19447]6055   She-' Harry began, rather hoarsely, he cleared his throat and tried again
[19448]797    She-er-'Did you kiss
[19449]1992  ' asked Hermione briskly
[19450]2442   Ron sat up so fast he sent his ink bottle flying all over the rug
[19451]5921    Disregarding this completely, he stared avidly at Harry
[19452]0   Well
[19453]29  ' he demanded
[19454]19696   Harry looked from Ron's expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to Hermione's slight frown, and nodded
[19455]29   HA
[19456]3416  'Ron made a triumphant gesture with his fist and went into a raucous peal of laughter that made several timid-looking second-years over beside the window jump
[19457]13168    A reluctant grin spread over Harry's face as he watched Ron rolling around on the hearthrug
[19458]4538   Hermione gave Ron a look or deep disgust and returned to her letter
[19459]0   Well
[19460]13484  ' Ron said finally, looking up at Harry
[19461]0    How was it
[19462]6015  'Harry considered for a moment
[19463]5104   Wet,' he said truthfully
[19464]2596   Ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust, it was hard to tell
[19465]5893   Because she was crying,' Harry continued heavily
[19466]7721   Oh,' said Ron, his smile fading slightly
[19467]104    Are you that bad at kissing
[19468]13661  ' Dunno,' said Harry, who hadn't considered this, and immediately felt rather worried
[19469]73    Maybe I am
[19470]7369   'Of course you're not,' said Hermione absently, still scribbling away at her letter
[19471]771   How do you know
[19472]7143  ' said Ron very sharply
[19473]7710   Because Cho spends half her time crying these days,' said Hermione vaguely
[19474]275    She does it at mealtimes, in the loos, all over the place
[19475]8526   'You'd think a bit of kissing would cheer her up,' said Ron, grinning
[19476]9458   Ron,' said Hermione in a dignified voice, dipping the point of her quill into her inkpot, you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet
[19477]5073   'What's that supposed to mean
[19478]7105  ' said Ron indignantly
[19479]4919    What sort of person cries while someone's kissing them
[19480]11381  'Yeah,' said Harry, slightly desperately, who does
[19481]2940  'Hermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying expression on her face
[19482]8362   Don't you understand how Cho's feeling at the moment
[19483]356  ' she asked
[19484]12820   No,' said Harry and Ron together
[19485]1731   Hermione sighed and laid down her quill
[19486]5034   Well, obviously, she's feeling very sad, because of Cedric dying
[19487]13317    Then I expect she's feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry, and she can't work out who she likes best
[19488]23245    Then she'll be feeling guilty, thinking it's an insult to Cedric's memory to be kissing Harry at all, and she'll be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with Harry
[19489]13144    And she probably can't work out what her feelings towards Harry are, anyway, because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that's all very mixed up and painful
[19490]15546    Oh, and she's afraid she's going to be thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because she's been flying so badly
[19491]10746   ' A slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech, then Ron said, One person can't feel all that at once, they'd explode
[19492]11642   'Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn't mean we all have,' said Hermione nastily, picking up her quill again
[19493]10935   She was the one who started it,' said Harry
[19494]23732    I wouldn't've-she just sort of came at me-and next thing she's crying all over me-I didn't know what to do-'Don't blame you, mate,' said Ron, looking alarmed at the very thought
[19495]8205   You just had to be nice to her,' said Hermione, looking up anxiously
[19496]2355    You were, weren't you
[19497]11646  'Well,' said Harry, an unpleasant heat creeping up his face, I sort of-patted her on the back a bit
[19498]2812   'Hermione looked as though she was restraining herself from rolling her eyes with extreme difficulty
[19499]5205   Well, I suppose it could have been worse,' she said
[19500]489    Are you going to see her again
[19501]3011  'I'll have to, won't I
[19502]10818  ' said Harry
[19503]3880    We've got DA meetings, haven't we
[19504]7748  ' You know what I mean,' said Hermione impatiently
[19505]10818   Harry said nothing
[19506]6792    Hermione's words opened up a whole new vista of frightening possibilities
[19507]1422    He tried to imagine going somewhere with Cho-Hogsmeade, perhaps-and being alone with her for hours at a time
[19508]1302    Of course, she would have been expecting him to ask her out after what had just happened 
[19509]0   
[19510]0   
[19511]468    the thought made his stomach clench painfully
[19512]7863   Oh well,' said Hermione distantly, buried in her letter once more, you'll have plenty of opportunities to ask her
[19513]2862   'What if he doesn't want to ask her
[19514]13563  ' said Ron, who had been watching Harry with an unusually shrewd expression on his face
[19515]28382   Don't be silly,' said Hermione vaguely, Harry's liked her for ages, haven't you, Harry
[19516]740  'He did not answer
[19517]981    Yes, he had liked Cho for ages, but whenever he had imagined a scene involving the two of them it had always featured a Cho who was enjoying herself, as opposed to a Cho who was sobbing uncontrollably into his shoulder
[19518]50   Who're you writing the novel to, anyway
[19519]4926  ' Ron asked Hermione, trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor
[19520]1721    Hermione hitched it up out of sight
[19521]2   Viktor
[19522]2   'Krum
[19523]772  'How many other Viktors do we know
[19524]7772  'Ron said nothing, but looked disgruntled
[19525]16378    They sat in silence for another twenty minutes, Ron finishing his Transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience and crossings-out, Hermione writing steadily to the very end of the parchment, rolling it up carefully and sealing it, and Harry staring into the fire, wishing more than anything that Sirius's head would appear there and give him some advice about girls
[19526]7475    But the fire merely crackled lower and lower, until the red-hot embers crumbled into ash and, looking around, Harry saw that they were, yet again, the last ones in the common room
[19527]7142   Well, night,' said Hermione, yawning widely as she set off up the girls' staircase
[19528]91   What does she see in Krum
[19529]7896  ' Ron demanded, as he and Harry climbed the boys' stairs
[19530]22844   Well,' said Harry, considering the matter, I s'pose he's older, isn't he 
[19531]0   
[19532]0   
[19533]4929    and he's an international Quidditch player 
[19534]0   
[19535]0   
[19536]7442   'Yeah, but apart from that,' said Ron, sounding aggravated
[19537]7399    I mean, he's a grouchy git, isn't he
[19538]11465  'Bit grouchy, yeah,' said Harry, whose thoughts were still on Cho
[19539]902   They pulled off their robes and put on pyjamas in silence; Dean, Seamus and Neville were already asleep
[19540]13393    Harry put his glasses on his bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the hangings closed around his four-poster; instead, he stared at the patch of starry sky visible through the window next to Neville's bed
[19541]1563    If he had known, this time last night, that in twenty-four hours' time he would have kissed Cho Chang 
[19542]0   
[19543]0   
[19544]2769   Night,' grunted Ron, from somewhere to his right
[19545]11008   Night,' said Harry
[19546]629   Maybe next time 
[19547]0   
[19548]0   
[19549]556    if there was a next time 
[19550]0   
[19551]0   
[19552]825    she'd be a bit happier
[19553]863    He ought to have asked her out; she had probably been expecting it and was now really angry with him 
[19554]0   
[19555]0   
[19556]327    or was she lying in bed, still crying about Cedric
[19557]2000   He did not know what to think
[19558]6489    Hermione's explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather than easier to understand
[19559]5421   That's what they should teach us here, he thought, turning over on to his side, how girls' brains work 
[19560]0   
[19561]0   
[19562]669    it'd be more useful than Divination, anyway 
[19563]0   
[19564]0   
[19565]346   Neville snuffled in his sleep
[19566]297    An owl hooted somewhere out in the night
[19567]6229   Harry dreamed he was back in the DA room
[19568]5377    Cho was accusing him of luring her there under false pretences; she said he had promised her a hundred and fifty Chocolate Frog Cards if she showed up
[19569]5734    Harry protested 
[19570]0   
[19571]0   
[19572]1094    Cho shouted, Cedric gave me loads of Chocolate Frog Cards, look
[19573]760  ' And she pulled out fistfuls of Cards from inside her robes and threw them into the air
[19574]14223    Then she turned into Hermione, who said, You did promise her, you know, Harry

[19576]0   
[19577]1436    I think you'd better give her something else instead

[19579]0   
[19580]13    how about your Firebolt
[19581]14477  ' And Harry was protesting that he could not give Cho his Firebolt, because Umbridge had it, and anyway the whole thing was ridiculous, he'd only come to the DA room to put up some Christmas baubles shaped like Dobby's head

[19584]83   The dream changed 
[19585]0   
[19586]0   
[19587]388   His body felt smooth, powerful and flexible
[19588]591    He was gliding between shining metal bars, across dark, cold stone 
[19589]0   
[19590]0   
[19591]309    he was flat against the floor, sliding along on his belly 
[19592]0   
[19593]0   
[19594]364    it was dark, yet he could see objects around him shimmering in strange, vibrant colours 
[19595]0   
[19596]0   
[19597]578    he was turning his head 
[19598]0   
[19599]0   
[19600]149    at first glance the corridor was empty 
[19601]0   
[19602]0   
[19603]0    but no 
[19604]0   
[19605]0   
[19606]988    a man was sitting on the floor ahead, his chin drooping on to his chest, his outline gleaming in the dark 
[19607]0   
[19608]0   
[19609]5747   Harry put out his tongue 
[19610]0   
[19611]0   
[19612]5033    he tasted the man's scent on the air 
[19613]0   
[19614]0   
[19615]50    he was alive but drowsy 
[19616]0   
[19617]0   
[19618]963    sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor 
[19619]0   
[19620]5866   Harry longed to bite the man 
[19621]0   
[19622]0   
[19623]46    but he must master the impulse 
[19624]0   
[19625]0   
[19626]153    he had more important work to do 
[19627]0   
[19628]0   
[19629]129   But the man was stirring 
[19630]0   
[19631]0   
[19632]7533    a silver Cloak fell from his legs as he jumped to his feet; and Harry saw his vibrant, blurred outline towering above him, saw a wand withdrawn from a belt 
[19633]0   
[19634]0   
[19635]23    he had no choice 
[19636]0   
[19637]0   
[19638]5965    he reared high from the floor and struck once, twice, three times, plunging his fangs deeply into the man's flesh, feeling his ribs splinter beneath his jaws, feeling the warm gush of blood 
[19639]0   
[19640]0   
[19641]208   The man was yelling in pain 
[19642]0   
[19643]0   
[19644]200    then he fell silent 
[19645]0   
[19646]0   
[19647]199    he slumped backwards against the wall 
[19648]0   
[19649]0   
[19650]371    blood was splattering on to the floor 
[19651]0   
[19652]0   
[19653]105   His forehead hurt terribly 
[19654]0   
[19655]0   
[19656]116    it was aching fit to burst

[19659]5732   Harry
[19660]5732   HARRY
[19661]650  'He opened his eyes
[19662]1597    Every inch of his body was covered in icy sweat; his bed covers were twisted all around him like a strait-jacket; he felt as though a white-hot poker were being applied to his forehead
[19663]5732   Harry
[19664]2812  'Ron was standing over him looking extremely frightened
[19665]10749    There were more figures at the foot of Harry's bed

[19676]0   
[19677]6777    taking great gulps of air, Harry pushed himself up in bed, willing himself not to throw up again, the pain half-blinding him

[19689]0   
[19690]0   
[19691]12895   ' I'm going for help,' said the same scared voice, and Harry heard footsteps running out of the dormitory

[19693]0   
[19694]0   
[19695]818    you were just dreaming-' No

[19700]70    not an ordinary dream

[19708]0   
[19709]1120   'He could hear Seamus and Dean muttering but did not care
[19710]308    The pain in his forehead was subsiding slightly, though he was still sweating and shivering feverishly
[19711]2452    He retched again and Ron leapt backwards out of the way
[19712]10826   Harry, you're not well,' he said shakily
[19713]5330    Neville's gone for help
[19714]516   'I'm fine
[19715]6062  ' Harry choked, wiping his mouth on his pyjamas and shaking uncontrollably
[19716]16989    There's nothing wrong with me, it's your dad you've got to worry about-we need to find out where he is-he's bleeding like mad-I was-it was a huge snake
[19717]2545   'He tried to get out of bed but Ron pushed him back into it; Dean and Seamus were still whispering somewhere nearby
[19718]8053    Whether one minute passed or ten, Harry did not know; he simply sat there shaking, feeling the pain recede very slowly from his scar 
[19719]0   
[19720]0   
[19721]6168    then there were hurried footsteps coming up the stairs and he heard Neville's voice again
[19722]751   Over here, Professor
[19723]1541   'Professor McGonagall came hurrying into the dormitory in her tartan dressing gown, her glasses perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her bony nose
[19724]461   What is it, Potter
[19725]150   Where does it hurt
[19726]410  'He had never been so pleased to see her; it was a member of the Order of the Phoenix he needed now, not someone fussing over him and prescribing useless potions
[19727]16823   It's Ron's dad,' he said, sitting up again
[19728]9995    He's been attacked by a snake and it's serious, I saw it happen
[19729]604   'What do you mean, you saw it happen
[19730]6448  ' said Professor McGonagall, her dark eyebrows contracting

[19737]247   'You mean you dreamed this
[19738]0  'No

[19772]7217     Harry was so relieved she was taking him seriously that he did not hesitate, but jumped out of bed at once, pulled on his dressing gown and pushed his glasses back on to his nose
[19773]7226   Weasley, you ought to come too,' said Professor McGonagall
[19774]7504   They followed Professor McGonagall past the silent figures of Neville, Dean and Seamus, out of the dormitory down the spiral stairs into the common room, through the portrait hole and off along the Fat Lady's moonlit corridor
[19775]7942    Harry felt as though the panic inside him might spill over at any moment; he wanted to run, to yell for Dumbledore; Mr
[19776]7452    Weasley was bleeding as they walked along so sedately and what if those fangs (Harry tried hard not to think my fangs') had been poisonous
[19777]484   They passed Mrs
[19778]6977    Norris, who turned her lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly but Professor McGonagall said, Shoo
[19779]369  ' Mrs
[19780]6575    Norris slunk away into the shadows, and in a few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore s office
[19781]6097   Fizzing Whizzbee,' said Professor McGonagall
[19782]1396   The gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside; the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continually upwards like a spiral escalator
[19783]2106    The three of them stepped on to the moving stairs; the wall closed behind them with a thud and they were moving upwards in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin
[19784]974   Though it was now well past midnight there were voices coming from inside the room, a positive babble of them
[19785]1211    It sounded as though Dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people
[19786]1164   Professor McGonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them all off
[19787]9659    The door opened of its own accord and Professor McGonagall led Harry and Ron inside
[19788]2118   The room was in half-darkness; the strange silver instruments standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emitting puffs of smoke as they usually did; the portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their frames
[19789]1272    Behind the door, a magnificent red and gold bird the size of a swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing
[19790]6118   Oh, it's you, Professor McGonagall 
[19791]0   
[19792]0   
[19793]0    and 
[19794]0   
[19795]0   
[19796]51    ah
[19797]1487   'Dumbledore was sitting in a high-backed chair behind his desk; he leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before him
[19798]2105    He was wearing a magnificently embroidered purple and gold dressing gown over a snowy white nightshirt, but seemed wide-awake, his penetrating light blue eyes fixed intently upon Professor McGonagall
[19799]2029   Professor Dumbledore, Potter has had a 
[19800]0   
[19801]0   
[19802]6100    well, a nightmare,' said Professor McGonagall
[19803]86    He says 
[19804]0   
[19805]0   
[19806]13430   'It wasn't a nightmare,' said Harry quickly
[19807]7744   Professor McGonagall looked round at Harry, frowning slightly
[19808]848   Very well, then, Potter, you tell the Headmaster about it
[19809]0   'I 
[19810]0   
[19811]0   
[19812]30    well, I was asleep 
[19813]0   
[19814]0   
[19815]13145   ' said Harry and, even in his terror and his desperation to make Dumbledore understand, he felt slightly irritated that the Headmaster was not looking at him, but examining his own interlocked fingers
[19816]2519    But it wasn't an ordinary dream 
[19817]0   
[19818]0   
[19819]58    it was real 
[19820]0   
[19821]0   
[19822]373    I saw it happen 
[19823]0   
[19824]0   
[19825]7612   ' He took a deep breath, Ron's dad-Mr
[19826]812    Weasley-has been attacked by a giant snake
[19827]5571   'The words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them, sounding slightly ridiculous, even comic
[19828]1072    There was a pause in which Dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling
[19829]9369    Ron looked from Harry to Dumbledore, white-faced and shocked
[19830]667   How did you see this
[19831]7647  ' Dumbledore asked quietly, still not looking at Harry
[19832]0   Well 
[19833]0   
[19834]0   
[19835]15366    I don't know,' said Harry, rather angrily-what did it matter
[19836]6715   Inside my head, I suppose-'You misunderstand me,' said Dumbledore, still in the same calm tone
[19837]231    I mean 
[19838]0   
[19839]0   
[19840]431    can you remember-er-where you were positioned as you watched this attack happen
[19841]784   Were you perhaps standing beside the victim, or else looking down on the scene from above
[19842]6904  'This was such a curious question that Harry gaped at Dumbledore; it was almost as though he knew 
[19843]0   
[19844]0   
[19845]5150   I was the snake,' he said
[19846]5267    I saw it all from the snake's point of view
[19847]4940   ' Nobody else spoke for a moment, then Dumbledore, now looking at Ron who was still whey-faced, asked in a new and sharper voice, Is Arthur seriously injured
[19848]12279  'Yes,' said Harry emphatically-why were they all so slow on the uptake, did they not realise how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced their side
[19849]1423   And why could Dumbledore not do him the courtesy of looking at him
[19850]7276  But Dumbledore stood up, so quickly it made Harry jump, and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling
[19851]5    Everard
[19852]5141  ' he said sharply
[19853]6    And you too, Dilys
[19854]1745  'A sallow-faced wizard with a short black fringe and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him, both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps, opened their eyes immediately
[19855]60   You were listening
[19856]5903  ' said Dumbledore
[19857]5382   The wizard nodded; the witch said, Naturally
[19858]6347   'The man has red hair and glasses,' said Dumbledore
[19859]2251    Everard, you will need to raise the alarm, make sure he is found by the right people-'Both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames, but instead of emerging in neighbouring pictures (as usually happened at Hogwarts) neither reappeared
[19860]381    One frames now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain, the other a handsome leather armchair
[19861]6332    Harry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls, though snoring and drooling most convincingly, kept sneaking peeks at him from under their eyelids, and he suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked
[19862]15304   Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwartss most celebrated Heads,' Dumbledore said, now sweeping around Harry, Ron and Professor McGonagall to approach the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door
[19863]169    Their renown is such that both have portraits hanging in other important wizarding institutions
[19864]458    As they are free to move between their own portraits, they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere 
[19865]0   
[19866]0   
[19867]372   'But Mr
[19868]636    Weasley could be anywhere
[19869]10818  ' said Harry
[19870]11819   Please sit down, all three of you,' said Dumbledore, as though Harry had not spoken, Everard and Dilys may not be back for several minutes
[19871]1074    Professor McGonagall, if you could draw up extra chairs
[19872]13685   'Professor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air, straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured up at Harry's hearing
[19873]6938    Harry sat down, watching Dumbledore over his shoulder
[19874]6194    Dumbledore was now stroking Fawkes's plumed golden head with one finger
[19875]133    The phoenix awoke immediately
[19876]2311    He stretched his beautiful head high and observed Dumbledore through bright, dark eyes
[19877]6282   We will need,' Dumbledore said very quietly to the bird, a warning
[19878]213   'There was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone
[19879]7517   Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function Harry had never known, carried it over to his desk, sat down facing them again and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand
[19880]122   The instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking noises
[19881]340    Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top
[19882]1002    Dumbledore watched the smoke closely, his brow furrowed
[19883]358    After a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air 
[19884]0   
[19885]0   
[19886]5771    a serpent's head grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth wide
[19887]9958    Harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story: he looked eagerly at Dumbledore for a sign that he was right, but Dumbledore did not look up
[19888]1073   Naturally, naturally,' murmured Dumbledore apparently to himself, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise
[19889]15    But in essence divided
[19890]6509  'Harry could make neither head nor tail of this question
[19891]564    The smoke serpent, however, split itself instantly into two snakes, both coiling and undulating in the dark air
[19892]2249    With a look of grim satisfaction, Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand: the clinking noise slowed and died and the smoke serpents grew faint, became a formless haze and vanished
[19893]1346   Dumbledore replaced the instrument on its spindly little table
[19894]12751    Harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with their eyes, then, realising that Harry was watching them, hastily pretend to be sleeping again
[19895]7196    Harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for, but before he could do so, there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right; the wizard called Everard had reappeared in his portrait
[19896]189   , panting slightly
[19897]817   Dumbledore
[19898]54  'What news
[19899]5903  ' said Dumbledore at once
[19900]15527   I yelled until someone came running,' said the wizard, who was mopping his brow on the curtain behind him, said I'd heard something moving downstairs-they weren't sure whether to believe me but went down to check-you know there are no portraits down there to watch from
[19901]259    Anyway, they carried him up a few minutes later
[19902]21933    He doesn't look good, he's covered in blood, I ran along to Elfrida Cragg's portrait to get a good view as they left-'Good,' said Dumbledore as Ron made a convulsive movement
[19903]6841    I take it Dilys will have seen him arrive, then-'And moments later, the silver-ringleted witch had reappeared in her picture, too; she sank, coughing, into her armchair and said, Yes, they've taken him to St

[19916]217   'Of course

[19920]8474    Harry cast a sideways glance at Ron, who was looking terrified
[19921]859   And Dumbledore- what about Molly
[19922]6599  ' said Professor McGonagall, pausing at the door
[19923]6142   That will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching,' said Dumbledore
[19924]771    But she may already know 
[19925]0   
[19926]0   
[19927]84    that excellent clock of hers 
[19928]0   
[19929]0   
[19930]9299   'Harry knew Dumbledore was referring to the clock that told, not the time, but the whereabouts and conditions of the various Weasley family members, and with a pang he thought that Mr
[19931]5846    Weasley's hand must, even now, be pointing at mortal peril
[19932]44   But it was very late
[19933]369    Mrs
[19934]924    Weasley was probably asleep, not watching the clock
[19935]6526    Harry felt cold as he remembered Mrs
[19936]5859    Weasley's boggart turning into Mr
[19937]6210    Weasley's lifeless body, his glasses askew, blood running down his face 
[19938]0   
[19939]0   
[19940]372    but Mr
[19941]3595    Weasley wasn't going to die

[19947]8588   Dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind Harry and Ron
[19948]530    He emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle, which he placed carefully on his desk
[19949]547    He raised his wand and murmured, Portus
[19950]904  ' For a moment the kettle trembled, glowing with an odd blue light; then it quivered to rest, as solidly black as ever
[19951]9170   Dumbledore marched over to another portrait, this time of a clever-looking wizard with a pointed beard, who had been painted wearing the Slytherin colours of green and silver and was apparently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear Dumbledore's voice when he attempted to rouse him
[19952]38   Phineas
[19953]38    Phineas
[19954]918   'The subjects of the portraits lining the room were no longer pretending to be asleep; they were shifting around in their frames, the better to watch what was happening
[19955]1035    When the clever-looking wizard continued to feign sleep, some of them shouted his name, too
[19956]38   Phineas
[19957]38   Phineas
[19958]38   PHINEAS
[19959]1028  'He could not pretend any longer; he gave a theatrical jerk and opened his eyes wide
[19960]667   Did someone call
[19961]6203  'I need you to visit your other portrait again, Phineas,' said Dumbledore
[19962]1414    I've got another message
[19963]79   'Visit my other portrait
[19964]12774  ' said Phineas in a reedy voice, giving a long, fake yawn (his eyes travelling around the room and focusing on Harry)
[19965]1244    Oh, no, Dumbledore, I am too tired tonight
[19966]11349   'Something about Phineas's voice was familiar to Harry, where had he heard it before
[19967]744   But before he could think, the portraits on the surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest
[19968]144   Insubordination, sir
[19969]323  ' roared a corpulent, red-nosed wizard, brandishing his fists
[19970]14    Dereliction of duty
[19971]373  'We are honour-bound to give service to the present Headmaster of Hogwarts
[19972]12323  ' cried a frail-looking old wizard whom Harry recognised as Dumbledore's predecessor, Armando Dippet
[19973]39    Sharne on you, Phineas
[19974]829  'Shall I persuade him, Dumbledore
[19975]1360  ' called a gimlet-eyed witch, raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod
[19976]29853   Oh, very well,' said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing the wand with mild apprehension, though he may well have destroyed my picture by now, he's done away with most of the family-'Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait,' said Dumbledore, and Harry realised immediately where he had heard Phineas's voice before: issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place
[19977]7233    You are to give him the message that Arthur Weasley has been gravely injured and that his wife, children and Harry Potter will be arriving at his house shortly
[19978]88    Do you understand
[19979]7777  'Arthur Weasley, injured, wife and children and Harry Potter coming to stay,' repeated Phineas in a bored voice
[19980]584    Yes, yes 
[19981]0   
[19982]0   
[19983]0    very well 
[19984]0   
[19985]0   
[19986]1456   'He sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from view at the very moment the study door opened again
[19987]3313    Fred, George and Ginny were ushered inside by Professor McGonagall, all three of them looking dishevelled and shocked, still in their night things
[19988]10971   Harry-what's going on
[19989]1395  ' asked Ginny, who looked frightened
[19990]13955    Professor McGonagall says you saw Dad get hurt-'Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order of the Phoenix,' said Dumbledore, before Harry could speak
[19991]119    He has been taken to St
[19992]4962    Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries
[19993]5701    I am sending you back to Sirius's house, which is much more convenient for the hospital than The Burrow
[19994]138    You will meet your mother there
[19995]489   'How're we going
[19996]1396  ' asked Fred, looking shaken
[19997]44    Floo powder
[19998]6339  'No,' said Dumbledore, Floo powder is not safe at the moment, the Network is being watched
[19999]134    You will be taking a Portkey
[20000]428   ' He indicated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk
[20001]973    We are just waiting for Phineas Nigellus to report back 
[20002]0   
[20003]0   
[20004]1389    I want to be sure that the coast is clear before sending you-'There was a flash of flame in the very middle of: the office, leaving behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor
[20005]10895   It is Fawkes's warning,' said Dumbledore, catching the feather as it fell
[20006]2111    Professor Umbridge must know you're out of your beds 
[20007]0   
[20008]0   
[20009]2049    Minerva, go and head her off-tell her any story-'Professor McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan
[20010]7604   He says he'll be delighted,' said a bored voice behind Dumbledore; the wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his Slytherin banner
[20011]798    My great-great-grandson has always had an odd taste in house-guests
[20012]12113   'Come here, then,' Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys
[20013]156    And quickly, before anyone else joins us
[20014]11444   'Harry and the others gathered around Dumbledore's desk
[20015]79   You have all used a Portkey before
[20016]1293  ' asked Dumbledore, and they nodded, each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle
[20017]343    Good
[20018]18    On the count of three, then 
[20019]0   
[20020]0   
[20021]0    one 
[20022]0   
[20023]0   
[20024]0    two 
[20025]0   
[20026]0   
[20027]29541   'It happened in a fraction of a second: in the infinitesimal pause before Dumbledore said three', Harry looked up at him-they were very close together-and Dumbledore's clear blue gaze moved from the Portkey to Harry's face
[20028]18463   At once, Harry's scar burned white-hot, as though the old wound had burst open again-and unbidden, unwanted, but terrifyingly strong, there rose within Harry a hatred so powerful he felt, for that instant, he would like nothing better than to strike-to bite-to sink his fangs into the man before him-
[20029]0   
[20030]0   
[20031]0    three
[20032]7124   'Harry felt a powerful jerk behind his navel, the ground vanished from beneath his feet, his hand was glued to the kettle; he was banging into the others as they all sped forwards in a swirl of colours and a rush of wind, the kettle pulling them onwards 
[20033]0   
[20034]0   
[20035]6988    until his feet hit the ground so hard his knees buckled, the kettle clattered to the ground, and somewhere close at hand a voice said:Back again, the blood-traitor brats
[20036]4914    Is it true their father's dying
[20037]0  'OUT
[20038]747  ' roared a second voice
[20039]7126   Harry scrambled to his feet and looked around; they had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve, Grimmauld Place
[20040]174    The only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle, which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper
[20041]2756    Kreacher was disappearing through the door to the hall, looking back at them malevolently as he hitched up his loincloth; Sirius was hurrying towards them all, looking anxious
[20042]1176    He was unshaven and still in his day clothes; there was also a slightly Mundungus-like whiff of stale drink about him
[20043]5239   What's going on
[20044]5941  ' he said, stretching out a hand to help Ginny up
[20045]21329    Thineas Nigellus said Arthur's been badly injured-'Ask Harry,' said Fred
[20046]6265   Yeah, I want to hear this for myself,' said George
[20047]540   The twins and Ginny were staring at him
[20048]5237    Kreacher's footsteps had stopped on the stairs outside
[20049]7074   It was-' Harry began; this was even worse than telling McGonagall and Dumbledore
[20050]110    I had a-a kind of-vision 
[20051]0   
[20052]0   
[20053]6132   'And he told them all that he had seen, though he altered the story so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked, rather than from behind the snake's own eyes
[20054]3518    Ron, who was still very white, gave him a fleeting look, but did not speak
[20055]7313    When Harry had finished, Fred, George and Ginny continued to stare at him for a moment
[20056]7271    Harry did not know whether he was imagining it or not, but he fancied there was something accusatory in their looks
[20057]2592    Well, if they were going to blame him just for seeing the attack, he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the snake at the time
[20058]79   Is Mum here
[20059]6249  ' said Fred, turning to Sirius
[20060]13881   She probably doesn't even know what's happened yet,' said Sirius
[20061]1153    The important thing was to get you away before Umbridge could interfere
[20062]6452    I expect Dumbledore's letting Molly know now
[20063]1423   'We've got to go to St
[20064]6364    Mungos,' said Ginny urgently, She looked around at her brothers; they were of course still in their pyjamas
[20065]658    Sirius, can you lend us cloaks or anything
[20066]2377  'Hang on, you can't go tearing off to St
[20067]4785    Mungo's
[20068]5733  ' said Sirius
[20069]257   Course we can go to St
[20070]10702    Mungo's if we want,' said Fred, with a mulish expression
[20071]4860    He's our dad
[20072]2098  'And how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know
[20073]175  'What does that matter
[20074]5472  ' said George hotly
[20075]9809   It matters because we don't want to draw attention to the fact that Harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles away
[20076]5816  ' said Sirius angrily
[20077]571    Have you any idea what the Ministry would make off that information
[20078]1779  ' Fred and George looked as though they could not care less what the Ministry made of anything
[20079]2095    Ron was still ashen-faced and silent
[20080]5798   Ginny said, Somebody else could have told us 
[20081]0   
[20082]0   
[20083]6003    we could have heard it somewhere other than Harry
[20084]734   'Like who
[20085]5778  ' said Sirius impatiently
[20086]13566    Listen, your dad's been hurt while on duty for the Order and the circumstances are fishy enough without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened, you could seriously damage the Order's-'We don't care about the dumb Order
[20087]563  ' shouted Fred
[20088]5021   It's our dad dying we're talking about
[20089]457  ' yelled George
[20090]3265   Your father knew what he was getting into and he won't thank you for messing things up for the Order
[20091]5807  ' said Sirius, equally angry
[20092]3358    This is how it is-this is why you're not in the Order-you don't understand-there are things worth dying for
[20093]329  'Easy for you to say, stuck here
[20094]462  ' bellowed Fred
[20095]3007    I don't see you risking your neck
[20096]6246  'The little colour remaining in Sirius's face drained from it
[20097]3054    He looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit Fred, but when he spoke, it was in a voice of determined calm
[20098]10813   I know it's hard, but we've all got to act as though we don't know anything yet
[20099]2286    We've got to stay put, at least until we hear from your mother, all right
[20100]1483  'Fred and George still looked mutinous
[20101]811    Ginny, however, took a few steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it
[20102]8638    Harry looked at Ron, who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and a shrug, and they sat down too
[20103]1317    The twins glared at Sirius for another minute, then took seats either side of Ginny
[20104]11489   That's right,' said Sirius encouragingly, come on, lets all 
[20105]0   
[20106]0   
[20107]5182    let's all have a drink while we're waiting
[20108]33    Accio Butterbeer
[20109]6854  'He raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying towards them out of the pantry, skidded along the table, scattering the debris of Sirius's meal, and stopped neatly in front of the six of them
[20110]389    They all drank, and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table
[20111]5917   Harry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands
[20112]176    His stomach was full of horrible hot, bubbling guilt
[20113]207    They would not be here if it were not for him; they would all still be asleep in bed
[20114]853    And it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured that Mr
[20115]1105    Weasley was found, because there was also the inescapable business of it being he who had attacked Mr
[20116]819    Weasley in the first place
[20117]9886   Don't be stupid, you haven't got fangs, he told himself, trying to keep calm, though the hand on his Butterbeer bottle was shaking, you were lying in bed, you weren't attacking anyone 
[20118]0   
[20119]0   
[20120]6688   But then, what just happened in Dumbledore's office
[20121]356   he asked himself
[20122]2069    I felt like I wanted to attack Dumbledore, too 
[20123]0   
[20124]0   
[20125]604   He put the bottle down a little harder than he meant to, and it slopped over on to the table
[20126]244    No one took any notice
[20127]1135    Then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of them and, as they gave cries of shock, a scroll of parchment fell with a thud on to the table, accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail feather
[20128]43   Fawkes
[20129]5861  ' said Sirius at once, snatching up the parchment
[20130]16639    That's not Dumbledore's writing- it must be a message from your mother-here-'He thrust the letter into George's hand, who ripped it open and read aloud: Dad is still alive
[20131]61    I am setting out for St
[20132]4785    Mungo's now
[20133]71    Stay where you are
[20134]147    I will send news as soon as I can
[20135]79    Mum
[20136]1260   'George looked around the table
[20137]43   Still alive 
[20138]0   
[20139]0   
[20140]5212   ' he said slowly
[20141]128    But that makes it sound 
[20142]0   
[20143]0   
[20144]885   'He did not need to finish the sentence
[20145]6159    It sounded to Harry, too, as though Mr
[20146]898    Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death
[20147]7297    Still exceptionally pale, Ron stared at the back of his mother's letter as though it might speak words of comfort to him
[20148]13586    Fred pulled the parchment out of George's hands and read it for himself, then looked up at Harry, who felt his hand shaking on his Butterbeer bottle again and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling
[20149]6219   If Harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one, he could not remember it
[20150]1114    Sirius suggested once, without any real conviction, that they all go to bed, but the Weasleys' looks of disgust were answer enough
[20151]2769    They mostly sat in silence around the table, watching the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax, occasionally raising a bottle to their lips, speaking only to check the time, to wonder aloud what was happening, and to reassure each other that if there was bad news, they would know straightaway, for Mrs
[20152]1095    Weasley must long since have arrived at St
[20153]4785    Mungo's
[20154]1231   Fred fell into a doze, his head lolling sideways on to his shoulder
[20155]7709    Ginny was curled like a cat on her chair, but her eyes were open; Harry could see them reflecting the firelight
[20156]3191    Ron was sitting with his head in his hands, whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell
[20157]7220    Harry and Sirius looked at each other every so often, intruders upon the family grief, waiting 
[20158]0   
[20159]0   
[20160]84    waiting 
[20161]0   
[20162]0   
[20163]8323   At ten past five in the morning by Ron's watch, the kitchen door swung open and Mrs
[20164]798    Weasley entered the kitchen
[20165]9593    She was extremely pale, but when they all turned to look at her, Fred, Ron and Harry half rising from their chairs, she gave a wan smile
[20166]11440   He's going to be all right,' she said, her voice weak with tiredness
[20167]4765    He's sleeping
[20168]125    We can all go and see him later
[20169]10318    Bill's sitting with him now; he's going to take the morning off work
[20170]1379   'Fred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face
[20171]1667    George and Ginny got up, walked swiftly over to their mother and hugged her
[20172]2418    Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his Butterbeer in one
[20173]47   Breakfast
[20174]6133  ' said Sirius loudly and joyfully, jumping to his feet
[20175]5061    Where's that accursed house-elf
[20176]118   Kreacher
[20177]118   KREACHER
[20178]859  'But Kreacher did not answer the summons
[20179]1464   Oh, forget it, then,' muttered Sirius, counting the people in front of him
[20180]9913    So, it's breakfast for-let's see-seven 
[20181]0   
[20182]0   
[20183]6597    bacon and eggs, I think, and some tea, and toast-'Harry hurried over to the stove to help
[20184]1695    He did not want to intrude on the Weasleys' happiness and he dreaded the moment when Mrs
[20185]771    Weasley would ask him to recount his vision
[20186]1552    However, he had barely taken plates from the dresser when Mrs Weasley lifted them out of his hands and pulled him into a hug
[20187]17640   I don't know what would have happened if it hadn't been for you, Harry' she said in a muffled voice
[20188]13136    They might not have found Arthur for hours, and then it would have been too late, but thanks to you he's alive and Dumbledore's been able to think up a good cover story for Arthur being where he was, you've no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise, look at poor Sturgis 
[20189]0   
[20190]0   
[20191]7463   ' Harry could hardly bear her gratitude, but fortunately she soon released him to turn to Sirius and thank him for looking after her children through the night
[20192]6877    Sirius said he was very pleased to have been able to help, and hoped they would all stay with him as long as Mr
[20193]692    Weasley was in hospital
[20194]1464   Oh, Sirius, I'm so grateful 
[20195]0   
[20196]0   
[20197]1483    they think he'll be there a little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer 
[20198]0   
[20199]0   
[20200]514    of course, that might mean we're here for Christmas
[20201]1   'The more the merrier
[20202]6119  ' said Sirius with such obvious sincerity that Mrs
[20203]1038    Weasley beamed at him, threw on an apron and began to help with breakfast
[20204]6909   Sirius,' Harry muttered, unable to stand it a moment longer
[20205]120    Can I have a quick word
[20206]121   Er- now
[20207]1240  'He walked into the dark pantry and Sirius followed
[20208]6690    Without preamble, Harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had, including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked Mr
[20209]636    Weasley
[20210]7666   When he paused for breath, Sirius said, Did you tell Dumbledore this
[20211]14241  'Yes,' said Harry impatiently,' but he didn't tell me what it meant
[20212]2749    Well, he doesn't tell me anything any more
[20213]6786   'I m sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about,' said Sirius steadily
[20214]16429   But that's not all,' said Harry, in a voice only a little above a whisper
[20215]647    Sirius, I 
[20216]0   
[20217]0   
[20218]1579    I think I'm going mad

[20220]0

[20222]4340    for a couple of seconds there I thought I was a snake, I felt like one-my scar really hurt when I was looking at Dumbledore-Sirius, I wanted to attack him
[20223]6075  'He could only see a sliver of Sirius's face; the rest was in darkness
[20224]10511   It must have been the aftermath of the vision, that's all,' said Sirius
[20225]20719    You were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and-'It wasn't that,' said Harry, shaking his head, it was like something rose up inside me, like there's a snake inside me
[20226]6000   'You need to sleep,' said Sirius firmly
[20227]853    You're going to have breakfast, then go upstairs to bed, and after lunch you can go and see Arthur with the others
[20228]11353    You're in shock, Harry; you're blaming yourself for something you only witnessed, and it's lucky you did witness it or Arthur might have died
[20229]948    Just stop worrying
[20230]12406   'He clapped Harry on the shoulder and left the pantry, leaving Harry standing alone in the dark
[20231]5998   Everyone but Harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping
[20232]13213    He went up to the bedroom he and Ron had shared over the last few weeks of summer, but while Ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes, Harry sat fully clothed, hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead, keeping himself deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze, terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and wake to find that he had attacked Ron, or else slithered through the house after one of the others 
[20233]0   
[20234]0   
[20235]7768   When Ron woke up, Harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too
[20236]497    Their trunks arrived from Hogwarts while they were eating lunch, so they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St
[20237]4785    Mungo's
[20238]6026    Everybody except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts
[20239]2116    When Tonks and Mad-Eye turned up to escort them across London, they greeted them gleefully, laughing at the bowler hat Mad-Eye was wearing at an angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him, truthfully, that Tonks, whose hair was short and bright pink again, would attract far less attention on the Underground
[20240]11070   Tonks was very interested in Harry's vision of the attack on Mr
[20241]6406    Weasley, something Harry was not remotely interested in discussing
[20242]2586   There isn't any Seer blood in your family, is there
[20243]315  ' she enquired curiously, as they sat side by side on a train rattling towards the heart of the city
[20244]11915   No,' said Harry thinking of Professor Trelawney and feeling insulted
[20245]10535   No,' said Tonks musingly, no, I suppose it's not really prophecy you're doing, is it
[20246]370   I mean, you're not seeing the future, you're seeing the present 
[20247]0   
[20248]0   
[20249]7216    it's odd, isn't it
[20250]20   Useful, though 
[20251]0   
[20252]0   
[20253]11028   'Harry didn't answer; fortunately, they got out at the next stop, a station in the very heart of London, and in the bustle of leaving the train he was able to allow Fred and George to get between himself and Tonks, who was leading the way
[20254]1229    They all followed her up the escalator, Moody clunking along at the back of the group, his bowler tilted low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat, clutching his wand
[20255]6639    Harry thought he sensed the concealed eye staring hard at him
[20256]988    Trying to avoid any more questions about his dream, he asked Mad-Eye where St
[20257]4825    Mungo's was hidden
[20258]649   Not far from here,' grunted Moody as they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad store-lined street packed with Christmas shoppers
[20259]13242    He pushed Harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just behind; Harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat
[20260]2874    Wasn't easy to find a good location for a hospital
[20261]5928    Nowhere in Diagon Alley was big enough and we couldn't have it underground like the Ministry-wouldn't be healthy
[20262]346    In the end they managed to get hold of a building up here
[20263]1499    Theory was, sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd
[20264]10861   'He seized Harry's shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets
[20265]5576   Here we go,' said Moody a moment later
[20266]901   They had arrived outside a large, old-fashioned, red-brick department store called Purge & Dowse Ltd
[20267]889    The place had a shabby, miserable air; the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies with their wigs askew, standing at random and modelling fashions at least ten years out of date
[20268]599    Large signs on all the dusty doors read: Closed for Refurbishment'
[20269]11948    Harry distinctly heard a large woman laden with plastic shopping bags say to her friend as they passed, It's never open, that place 
[20270]0   
[20271]0   
[20272]6007   'Right,' said Tonks, beckoning them towards a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy
[20273]155    Its false eyelashes were hanging off and it was modelling a green nylon pinafore dress
[20274]124    Everybody ready
[20275]59  'They nodded, clustering around her
[20276]7412    Moody gave Harry another shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and Tonks leaned close to the glass, looking up at the very ugly dummy, her breath steaming up the glass
[20277]5791    Wotcher,' she said, we're here to see Arthur Weasley
[20278]6919   'Harry thought how absurd it was for Tonks to expect the dummy to hear her talking so quietly through a sheet of glass, with buses rumbling along behind her and all the racket of a street full of shoppers
[20279]2648    Then he reminded himself that dummies couldn't hear anyway
[20280]1772    Next second, his mouth opened in shock as the dummy gave a tiny nod and beckoned with its jointed finger, and Tonks had seized Ginny and Mrs
[20281]1413    Weasley by the elbows, stepped right through the glass and vanished
[20282]2870   Fred, George and Ron stepped after them
[20283]8159    Harry glanced around at the jostling crowd; not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays as ugly as those of Purge & Dowse Ltd; nor did any of them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in front of them
[20284]7473   C'mon,' growled Moody, giving Harry yet another poke in the back, and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet of cool water, emerging quite warm and dry on the other side
[20285]287   There was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had stood
[20286]1419    They were in what seemed to be a crowded reception area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden chairs, some looking perfectly normal and perusing out-of-date copies of Witch Weekly, others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests
[20287]4660    The room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside, for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises: a sweaty-faced witch in the centre of the front row, who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the Daily Prophet, kept letting off a high-pitched whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth; a grubby-looking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved and, with each clang, his head vibrated horribly so that he had to seize himself by the ears to hold it steady
[20288]6718   Witches and wizards in lime-green robes were walking up and down the rows, asking questions and making notes on clipboards like Umbridge's
[20289]6266    Harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests: a wand and bone, crossed
[20290]2   Are they doctors
[20291]2495  ' he asked Ron quietly
[20292]2   Doctors
[20293]7702  ' said Ron, looking startled
[20294]452    Those Muggle nutters that cut people up
[20295]15   Nah, they're Healers
[20296]0   'Over here
[20297]488  ' called Mrs
[20298]1138    Weasley, above the renewed clanging of the warlock in the corner, and they followed her to the queue in front of a plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked Enquiries
[20299]2049   The wall behind her was covered in notices and posters saying things like: A CLEAN CAULDRON KEEPS POTIONS FROM BECOMING POISONS and ANTIDOTES ARE ANTI-DON'TS UNLESS APPROVED BY A QUALIFIED HEALER
[20300]812    There was also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets which was labelled:Dilys DerwentSt
[20301]12656    Mungo's Healer 1722-1741Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry1741-1768Dilys was eyeing the Weasley party closely as though counting them; when Harry caught her eye she gave a tiny wink, walked sideways out of her portrait and vanished
[20302]856   Meanwhile, at the front of the queue, a young wizard was performing an odd on-the-spot jig and trying, in between yelps of pain, to explain his predicament to the witch behind the desk
[20303]8195   It's these- ouch-shoes my brother gave me-ow-they re eating my-OUCH-feet-look at them, there must be some kind of-AARGH-jinx on them and I can't- AAAAARGH-get them off
[20304]139   ' He hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot coals
[20305]3022   The shoes don't prevent you reading, do they
[20306]5993  ' said the blonde witch, irritably pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk
[20307]711    You want Spell Damage, fourth floor
[20308]1903    Just like it says on the floor guide
[20309]0    Next
[20310]7560  'As the wizard hobbled and pranced sideways out of the way, the Weasley party moved forward a few steps and Harry read the floor guide:ARTEFACT ACCIDENTS

[20517]425   A very old, stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet had shuffled to the front of the queue now
[20518]467    I'm here to see Broderick Bode
[20519]4  ' he wheezed
[20520]6247   Ward forty-nine, but I'm afraid you're wasting your time,' said the witch dismissively
[20521]10389    He's completely addled, you know-still thinks he's a teapot
[20522]0    Next
[20523]2413  'A harassed-looking wizard was holding his small daughter tightly by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely large, feathery wings that had sprouted right out through the back of her romper suit
[20524]7357   Fourth floor,' said the witch, in a bored voice, without asking, and the man disappeared through the double doors beside the desk, holding his daughter like an oddly shaped balloon
[20525]0    Next
[20526]369  'Mrs
[20527]910    Weasley moved forward to the desk
[20528]6508   Hello,' she said, my husband, Arthur Weasley, was supposed to be moved to a different ward this morning, could you tell us-
[20529]702  'Arthur Weasley
[20530]5641  ' said the witch, running her finger down a long list in front of her
[20531]1810    Yes, first floor, second door on the right, Dai Llewellyn Ward
[20532]5495   ' Thank you,' said Mrs
[20533]636    Weasley
[20534]527    Come on, you lot
[20535]2031   'They followed her through the double doors and along the narrow corridor beyond, which was lined with more portraits of famous Healers and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling, looking like giant soapsuds
[20536]1729    More witches and wizards in lime-green robes walked in and out of the doors they passed; a foul-smelling yellow gas wafted into the passageway as they passed one door, and every now and then they heard distant wailing
[20537]1779    They climbed a flight of stairs and entered the Creature-Induced Injuries corridor, where the second door on the right bore the words: Dangerous' Dai Llewellyn Ward: Serious Bites
[20538]74   Underneath this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten: Healer-in-Charge: Hippocrates Smethwyck
[20539]29    Trainee Healer: Augustus Pye
[20540]6003   We'll wait outside, Molly,' Tonks said
[20541]2860    Arthur won't want too many visitors at once 
[20542]0   
[20543]0   
[20544]946    it ought to be just the family first
[20545]1076   'Mad-Eye growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his back against the corridor wall, his magical eye spinning in all directions
[20546]16740    Harry drew back, too, but Mrs Weasley reached out a hand and pushed him through the door, saying, Don't be silly, Harry, Arthur wants to thank you
[20547]1282   'The ward was small and rather dingy, as the only window was narrow and set high in the wall facing the door
[20548]547    Most of the light came from more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling
[20549]1089    The walls were of panelled oak and there was a portrait of a rather vicious-looking wizard on the wall, captioned: Urquhart Rackharrow, 1612-1697, Inventor of the Entrail-expelling Curse
[20550]2    There were only three patients
[20551]372    Mr
[20552]1435    Weasley was occupying the bed at the far end oi the ward beside the tiny window
[20553]6234    Harry was pleased and relieved to see that he was propped up on several pillows and reading the Daily Prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling on to his bed
[20554]896    He looked up as they walked towards him and, seeing who it was, beamed
[20555]36   Hello
[20556]260  ' he called, throwing the Prophet aside
[20557]2027    Bill just left, Molly, had to get back to work, but he says he'll drop in on you later
[20558]66   'How are you, Arthur
[20559]725  ' asked Mrs
[20560]1830    Weasley, bending down to kiss his cheek and looking anxiously into his face
[20561]803    You're still looking a bit peaky
[20562]5680   'I feel absolutely fine,' said Mr
[20563]1557    Weasley brightly, holding out his good arm to give Ginny a hug
[20564]735    If they could only take the bandages off, I'd be fit to go home
[20565]2418   'Why can't they take them off, Dad
[20566]784  ' asked Fred
[20567]7016   Well, I start bleeding like mad every time they try,' said Mr
[20568]1428    Weasley cheerfully, reaching across for his wand, which lay on his bedside cabinet, and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bedside to seat them all
[20569]5206    It seems there was some rather unusual kind of poison in that snake's fangs that keeps wounds open
[20570]2998    They're sure they'll find an antidote, though; they say they've had much worse cases than mine, and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a Blood-Replenishing Potion every hour
[20571]7075    But that fellow over there,' he said, dropping his voice and nodding towards the bed opposite in which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling
[20572]53    Bitten by a werewolf, poor chap
[20573]6    No cure at all
[20574]15   'A werewolf
[20575]492  ' whispered Mrs
[20576]1259    Weasley, looking alarmed
[20577]69    Is he safe in a public ward
[20578]2791   Shouldn't he be in a private room
[20579]5204  'It's two weeks till full moon,' Mr
[20580]793    Weasley reminded her quietly
[20581]2789    They've been talking to him this morning, the Healers, you know, trying to persuade him he'll be able to lead an almost normal life
[20582]13872    I said to him-didn't mention names, of course- but I said I knew a werewolf personally, very nice man, who finds the condition quite easy to manage
[20583]937   'What did he say
[20584]734  ' asked George
[20585]13990   Said he'd give me another bite if I didn't shut up,' said Mr
[20586]651    Weasley sadly
[20587]4875    And that woman over there,' he indicated the only other occupied bed, which was right beside the door, won't tell the Healers what bit her, which makes us all think it must have been something she was handling illegally
[20588]362    Whatever it was took a real chunk out of her leg, very nasty smell when they take off the dressings
[20589]1074   'So, you going to tell us what happened, Dad
[20590]1187  ' asked Fred, pulling his chair closer to the bed
[20591]3712   Well, you already know, don't you
[20592]5458  ' said Mr
[20593]6473    Weasley, with a significant smile at Harry
[20594]6603    It's very simple-I'd had a very long day, dozed off, got sneaked up on and bitten
[20595]122   'Is it in the Prophet, you being attacked
[20596]1183  ' asked Fred, indicating the newspaper Mr
[20597]701    Weasley had cast aside
[20598]5675   No, of course not,' said Mr
[20599]5710    Weasley, with a slightly bitter smile, the Ministry wouldn't want everyone to know a dirty great serpent got-'Arthur
[20600]1031  ' Mrs Weasley warned him
[20601]1183   -got-er- me,' Mr
[20602]12227    Weasley said hastily, though Harry was quite sure that was not what he had meant to say
[20603]253   So where were you when it happened, Dad
[20604]734  ' asked George
[20605]10246   That's my business,' said Mr
[20606]883    Weasley, though with a small smile
[20607]11225    He snatched up the Daily Prophet, shook it open again and said, I was just reading about Willy Widdershins's arrest when you arrived
[20608]1183    You know Willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets back in the summer
[20609]2324   One of his jinxes backfired, the toilet exploded and they found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in-'When you say you were on duty",' Fred interrupted in a low voice, what were you doing
[20610]858  'You heard your father,' whispered Mrs
[20611]645    Weasley, we are not discussing this here
[20612]78   Go on about Willy Widdershins, Arthur
[20613]9292   'Well, don't ask me how, but he actually got off the toilet charge,' said Mr
[20614]665    Weasley grimly
[20615]2687    I can only suppose gold changed hands-'You were guarding it, weren't you
[20616]5601  ' said George quietly
[20617]34    The weapon
[20618]5706   The thing You-Know-Who's after
[20619]419  'George, be quiet
[20620]420  ' snapped Mrs
[20621]636    Weasley
[20622]17018   Anyway,' said Mr Weasley, in a raised voice, this time Willy's been caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles and I don't think he'll be able to worm his way out of it because, according to this article, two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St
[20623]4840    Mungo's for emergency bone re-growth and memory modification
[20624]1458    Just think of it, Muggles in St
[20625]4785    Mungo's
[20626]58   I wonder which ward they're in
[20627]752  'And he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost
[20628]14985   Didn't you say You-Know-Who's got a snake, Harry
[20629]1491  ' asked Fred, looking at his father for a reaction
[20630]26    A massive one
[20631]3284   You saw it the night he returned, didn't you
[20632]10205  'That's enough,' said Mrs
[20633]640    Weasley crossly
[20634]1309    Mad-Eye and Tonks are outside, Arthur, they want to come and see you
[20635]6141    And you lot can wait outside,' she added to her children and Harry
[20636]714    You can come and say goodbye afterwards
[20637]0    Go on
[20638]124   ' They trooped back into the corridor
[20639]1170    Mad-Eye and Tonks went in and closed the door of the ward behind them
[20640]595    Fred raised his eyebrows
[20641]5939   Fine,' he said coolly, rummaging in his pockets, be like that
[20642]3273    Don't tell us anything
[20643]605   'Looking for these
[20644]7005  ' said George, holding out what looked like a tangle of flesh-coloured string
[20645]5836   You read my mind,' said Fred, grinning
[20646]5110    Let's see if St
[20647]4955    Mungo's puts Imperturbable Charms on its ward doors, shall we
[20648]505  'He and George disentangled the string and separated five Extendable Ears from each other
[20649]843    Fred and George handed them around
[20650]5758    Harry hesitated to take one
[20651]5732   Go on, Harry, take it
[20652]4966   You saved Dad's life
[20653]10750    If anyone's got the right to eavesdrop on him, it's you
[20654]6316   'Grinning in spite of himself, Harry took the end of the string and inserted it into his ear as the twins had done
[20655]82   OK, go
[20656]551  ' Fred whispered
[20657]1627   The flesh-coloured strings wriggled like long skinny worms and snaked under the door
[20658]7139    At first, Harry could hear nothing, then he jumped as he heard Tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside him
[20659]0   
[20660]0   
[20661]0   
[20662]2513    they searched the whole area but couldn't find the snake anywhere
[20663]990    It just seems to have vanished after it attacked you, Arthur 
[20664]0   
[20665]0   
[20666]3183    but You-Know-Who can't have expected a snake to get in, can he
[20667]5206  'I reckon he sent it as a lookout,' growled Moody, ' cause he's not had any luck so far, has he
[20668]14141   No, I reckon he's trying to get a clearer picture of what he's facing and if Arthur hadn't been there the beast would've had a lot more time to look around
[20669]920    So, Potter says he saw it all happen
[20670]6383  'Yes,' said Mrs Weasley
[20671]65    She sounded rather uneasy
[20672]8138    You know, Dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for Harry to see something like this
[20673]11502   'Yeah, well,' said Moody, there's something funny about the Potter kid, we all know that
[20674]7890   'Dumbledore seemed worried about Harry when I spoke to him this morning,' whispered Mrs Weasley
[20675]5146   ' Course he's worried,' growled Moody
[20676]10844    The boy's seeing things from inside You-Know-Who's snake
[20677]15218    Obviously, Potter doesn't realise what that means, but if You-Know-Who's possessing him-'Harry pulled the Extendable Ear out of his own, his heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up his face
[20678]676    He looked around at the others
[20679]993    They were all staring at him, the strings still trailing from their ears, looking suddenly fearful

[20689]11890     Was this why Dumbledore would no longer meet Harry's eyes
[20690]1479   Did he expect to see Voldemort staring out of them, afraid, perhaps, that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet, with catlike slits for pupils
[20691]14196   Harry remembered how the snakelike face of Voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of Professor Quirrell's head and ran his hand over the back of his own, wondering what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his skull
[20692]1205   He felt dirty, contaminated, as though he were carrying some deadly germ, unworthy to sit on the Underground train back from the hospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of Voldemort 
[20693]0   
[20694]0   
[20695]635    he had not merely seen the snake, he had been the snake, he knew it now 
[20696]0   
[20697]0   
[20698]1447   A truly terrible thought then occurred to him, a memory bobbing to the surface of his mind, one that made his insides writhe and squirm like serpents
[20699]4792   What's he after, apart from followers
[20700]75  Stuff he can only get by stealth 
[20701]0   
[20702]0   
[20703]768    like a weapon
[20704]3264    Something he didn't have last time
[20705]7032   I'm the weapon, Harry thought, and it was as though poison were pumping through his veins, chilling him, bringing him out in a sweat as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel
[20706]34355    I'm the one Voldemort's trying to use, that's why they've got guards around me everywhere I go, it's not for my protection, it's for other people's, only it's not working, they can't have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts 
[20707]0   
[20708]0   
[20709]1104    I did attack Mr
[20710]826    Weasley last night, it was me
[20711]12565    Voldemort made me do it and he could be inside me, listening to my thought's right now-'Are you all right, Harry, dear
[20712]492  ' whispered Mrs
[20713]1447    Weasley, leaning across Ginny to speak to him as the train rattled along through its dark tunnel
[20714]3398    You don't look very well
[20715]204    Are you feeling sick
[20716]142  'They were all watching him
[20717]769    He shook his head violently and stared up at an advertisement for home insurance
[20718]6606   Harry, dear, are you sure you're all right
[20719]5455  ' said Mrs
[20720]1726    Weasley in a worried voice, as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place
[20721]507    You look ever so pale 
[20722]0   
[20723]0   
[20724]332    are you sure you slept this morning
[20725]1539   You go upstairs to bed right now and you can have a couple of hours of sleep before dinner, all right
[20726]8445  'He nodded; here was a ready-made excuse not to talk to any of the others, which was precisely what he wanted, so when she opened the front door he hurried straight past the trolls-leg umbrella stand, up the stairs and into his and Ron's bedroom
[20727]5294   Here, he began to pace up and down, past the two beds and Phineas Nigellus's empty picture frame, his brain teeming and seething with questions and ever more dreadful ideas
[20728]64   How had he become a snake
[20729]6   Perhaps he was an Animagus 
[20730]0   
[20731]0   
[20732]3208    no, he couldn't be, he would know 
[20733]0   
[20734]0   
[20735]239    perhaps Voldemort was an Animagus 
[20736]0   
[20737]0   
[20738]6792    yes, thought Harry, that would fit, he would turn into a snake of course 
[20739]0   
[20740]0   
[20741]4758    and when he's possessing me, then we both transform 
[20742]0   
[20743]0   
[20744]3475    that still doesn't explain how I got to London and back to my bed in the space of about five minutes 
[20745]0   
[20746]0   
[20747]11960    but then Voldemort's about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from Dumbledore, it's probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that
[20748]6865   And then, with a terrible stab of panic, he thought, but this is insane-if Voldemort's possessing me, I'm giving him a clear view into the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now
[20749]6887   He'll know who's in the Order and where Sirius is 
[20750]0   
[20751]0   
[20752]4550    and I've heard loads of stuff I shouldn't have, everything Sirius told me the first night I was here 
[20753]0   
[20754]0   
[20755]532   There was only one thing for it: he would have to leave Grimmauld Place straightaway
[20756]386    He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts without the others, which would keep them safe over the holidays at least 
[20757]0   
[20758]0   
[20759]2995    but no, that wouldn't do, there were still plenty of people at Hogwarts to maim and injure
[20760]1008    What if it was Seamus, Dean or Neville next time
[20761]5283   He stopped his pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigellus's empty frame
[20762]94    A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his stomach
[20763]780    He had no alternative: he was going to have to return to Privet Drive, cut himself off from other wizards entirely
[20764]517   Well, if he had to do it, he thought, there was no point hanging around
[20765]9365    Trying with all his might not to think how the Dursleys were going to react when they found him on their doorstep six months earlier than they had expected, he strode over to his trunk, slammed the lid shut and locked it, then glanced around automatically for Hedwig before remembering that she was still at Hogwarts-well, her cage would be one less thing to carry-he seized one end of his trunk and had dragged it halfway towards the door when a snide voice said, Running away, are we
[20766]676  'He looked around
[20767]6717    Phineas Nigellus had appeared on the canvas of his portrait and was leaning against the frame, watching Harry with an amused expression on his face
[20768]12028   Not running away, no,' said Harry shortly, dragging his trunk a few more feet across the room
[20769]6176   I thought,' said Phineas Nigellus, stroking his pointed beard, that to belong in Gryffindor house you were supposed to be brave
[20770]483   It looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own house
[20771]427    We Slytherins are brave, yes, but not stupid
[20772]166    For instance, given the choice, we will always choose to save our own necks
[20773]17320   'It's not my own neck I'm saving,' said Harry tersely, tugging the trunk over a patch of particularly uneven, moth-eaten carpet right in front of the door
[20774]5567   Oh, I see,' said Phineas Nigellus, still stroking his beard, this is no cowardly flight-you are being noble
[20775]5755   'Harry ignored him
[20776]6387    His hand was on the doorknob when Phineas Nigellus said lazily, I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore
[20777]5864   'Harry span round
[20778]0   What is it
[20779]71  '"Stay where you are
[20780]2516    'I haven't moved
[20781]11183  ' said Harry, his hand still upon the doorknob
[20782]4781    So what's the message
[20783]6050  'I have just given it to you, dolt,' said Phineas Nigellus smoothly
[20784]974    Dumbledore says, Stay where you are
[20785]0   'Why
[20786]11185  ' said Harry eagerly, dropping the end of his trunk
[20787]495    Why does he want me to stay
[20788]937   What else did he say
[20789]11158  'Nothing whatsoever,' said Phineas Nigellus, raising a thin black eyebrow as though he found Harry impertinent
[20790]11768   Harry's temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass
[20791]2113    He was exhausted, he was confused beyond measure, he had experienced terror, relief, then terror again in the last twelve hours, and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him
[20792]4750  So that's it, is it
[20793]5222  ' he said loudly
[20794]71    "Stay where you are
[20795]5913   That's all anyone could tell me after I got attacked by those dementors, too
[20796]6700   Just stay put while the grown-ups sort it out, Harry
[20797]3090   We won't bother telling you anything, though, because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it
[20798]11869  'You know,' said Phineas Nigellus, even more loudly than Harry, this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher
[20799]957   Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything
[20800]511    Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there might be an excellent reason why the Headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you
[20801]6105   Have you never paused, while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore's orders has never yet led you into harm
[20802]0   No
[20803]2721   No, like all young people, you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognise danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to realise what the Dark Lord may be planning-'He is planning something to do with me, then
[20804]10834  ' said Harry swiftly
[20805]937   Did I say that
[20806]5177  ' said Phineas Nigellus, idly examining his silk gloves
[20807]416    Now, if you will excuse me, I have better things to do than listen to adolescent agonising 
[20808]0   
[20809]0   
[20810]504    good-day to you
[20811]169   'And he strolled to the edge of his frame and out of sight
[20812]75   Fine, go then
[20813]5780  ' Harry bellowed at the empty frame
[20814]1189    And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing
[20815]98  'The empty canvas remained silent
[20816]7407    Fuming, Harry dragged his trunk back to the foot of his bed, then threw himself face down on the moth-eaten covers, his eyes shut, his body heavy and aching
[20817]313   He felt as though he had journeyed for miles and miles 
[20818]0   
[20819]0   
[20820]322    it seemed impossible that less than twenty-four hours ago Cho Chang had been approaching him under the mistletoe 
[20821]0   
[20822]0   
[20823]21    he was so tired 
[20824]0   
[20825]0   
[20826]71    he was scared to sleep 
[20827]0   
[20828]0   
[20829]1821    yet he did not know how long he could fight it 
[20830]0   
[20831]0   
[20832]1210    Dumbledore had told him to stay 
[20833]0   
[20834]0   
[20835]316    that must mean he was allowed to sleep 
[20836]0   
[20837]0   
[20838]32    but he was scared 
[20839]0   
[20840]0   
[20841]143    what if it happened again
[20842]38  He was sinking into shadows 
[20843]0   
[20844]0   
[20845]653   It was as though a film in his head had been waiting to start
[20846]2122    He was walking down a deserted corridor towards a plain black door, past rough stone walls, torches, and an open doorway on to a flight of stone steps leading downstairs on the left 
[20847]0   
[20848]0   
[20849]1113   He reached the black door but could not open it
[20850]0   
[20851]0   
[20852]236    he stood gazing at it, desperate for entry 
[20853]0   
[20854]0   
[20855]348    something he wanted with all his heart lay beyond 
[20856]0   
[20857]0   
[20858]36    a prize beyond his dreams 
[20859]0   
[20860]0   
[20861]232    if only his scar would stop prickling 
[20862]0   
[20863]0   
[20864]759    then he would be able to think more clearly 
[20865]0   
[20866]0   
[20867]20170   Harry,' said Ron's voice, from far, far away, Mum says dinners ready, but she'll save you something if you want to stay in bed
[20868]9104   'Harry opened his eyes, but Ron had already left the room
[20869]8872   He doesn't want to be on his own with me, Harry thought
[20870]641    Not after what he heard Moody say
[20871]903   He supposed none of them would want him there any more, now that they knew what was inside him
[20872]84   He would not go down to dinner; he would not inflict his company on them
[20873]445    He turned over on to his other side and, after a while, dropped back off to sleep
[20874]2547    He woke much later, in the early hours of the morning, his insides aching with hunger and Ron snoring in the next bed
[20875]8394    Squinting around the room, he saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to Harry that Dumbledore had probably sent Phineas Nigellus to watch over him, in case he attacked somebody else
[20876]174   The feeling of being unclean intensified
[20877]1019    He half-wished he had not obeyed Dumbledore 
[20878]0   
[20879]0   
[20880]1114    if this was how life was going to be for him in Grimmauld Place from now on, maybe he would be better off in Privet Drive after all
[20881]334   Everybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas decorations
[20882]7102    Harry could not remember Sirius ever being in such a good mood; he was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that he was to have company over Christmas
[20883]9113    Harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold drawing room where he was sitting alone, watching the sky growing whiter outside the windows, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him, as they were bound to be doing
[20884]640    When he heard Mrs
[20885]856    Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime, he retreated further upstairs and ignored her
[20886]653   Around six o'clock in the evening the doorbell rang and Mrs
[20887]373    Black started screaming again
[20888]12508    Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call, Harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak's room where he was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed dead rats to the hippogriff
[20889]1243    It came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later
[20890]12761   I know you're in there,' said Hermione's voice
[20891]436    Will you please come out
[20892]455   I want to talk to you
[20893]182   'What are you doing here
[20894]7308  ' Harry asked her, pulling open the door as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any fragments of rat he may have dropped
[20895]583    I thought you were skiing with your mum and dad
[20896]12303  ' Well, to tell the truth, skiing's not really my thing,' said Hermione
[20897]1195    So, I've come here for Christmas
[20898]869   ' There was snow in her hair and her face was pink with cold
[20899]5275    But don't tell Ron
[20900]5878    I told him skiing's really good because he kept laughing so much
[20901]1726    Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed, but I've told them that everyone who is serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study
[20902]990    They want me to do well, they'll understand
[20903]21923    Anyway,' she said briskly, let's go to your bedroom, Ron's mum has lit a fire in there and she's sent up sandwiches
[20904]6284   'Harry followed her back to the second floor
[20905]9640    When he entered the bedroom, he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them, sitting on Ron's bed
[20906]13405   I came on the Knight Bus,' said Hermione airily, pulling off her jacket before Harry had time to speak
[20907]1925    Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off
[20908]2896    Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose, even though Dumbledore told her Mr
[20909]676    Weasley was in St
[20910]5522    Mungo's and he'd given you all permission to visit
[20911]0    So 
[20912]0   
[20913]0   
[20914]8916   'She sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron all looked up at Harry
[20915]168   How're you feeling
[20916]1971  ' asked Hermione
[20917]10903   Fine,' said Harry stiffly
[20918]14188   Oh, don't lie, Harry,' she said impatiently
[20919]4065    Ron and Ginny say you've been hiding from everyone since you got back from St
[20920]4785    Mungo's
[20921]0   'They do, do they
[20922]13177  ' said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny
[20923]3447    Ron looked down at his feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed
[20924]0   Well, you have
[20925]5086  ' she said
[20926]2901    And you won't look at any of us
[20927]7742  'It's you lot who won't look at me
[20928]10901  ' said Harry angrily
[20929]2510   Maybe you're taking it in turns to look, and keep missing each other,' suggested Hermione, the corners of her mouth twitching
[20930]6268   Very funny,' snapped Harry, turning away
[20931]7424   Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood,' said Hermione sharply
[20932]1370    Look, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears-' Yeah
[20933]6321  ' growled Harry, his hands deep in his pockets as he watched the snow now falling thickly outside
[20934]144    All been talking about me, have you
[20935]624   Well, I'm getting used to it
[20936]27016   'We wanted to talk toyou, Harry,' said Ginny, but as you've been hiding ever since we got back-'I didn't want anyone to talk to me,' said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled
[20937]15394   Well, that was a bit stupid of you,' said Ginny angrily, seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels
[20938]6169   'Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him
[20939]141    Then he wheeled round
[20940]5107   I forgot,' he said
[20941]5472   Lucky you,' said Ginny coolly
[20942]11400   I'm sorry,' Harry said, and he meant it
[20943]0    So 
[20944]0   
[20945]0   
[20946]1011    so, do you think I'm being possessed, then
[20947]980  'Well, can you remember everything you've been doing
[20948]692  ' Ginny asked
[20949]4498    Are there big blank periods where you don't know what you've been up to
[20950]5752  'Harry racked his brains
[20951]5086   No,' he said
[20952]8608   Then You-Know-Who hasn't ever possessed you,' said Ginny simply
[20953]4617    When he did it to me, I couldn't remember what I'd been doing for hours at a time
[20954]2082    I'd find myself somewhere and not know how I got there
[20955]5991   'Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost in spite of himself
[20956]13389   That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though-'Harry, you've had these dreams before,' Hermione said
[20957]418    You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year
[20958]11447   'This was different,' said Harry, shaking his head
[20959]262    I was inside that snake
[20960]798    It was like I was the snake 
[20961]0   
[20962]0   
[20963]257    what if Voldemort somehow transported me to London-
[20964]10664  'One day,' said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated, you'll read Hogwarts: A History, and perhaps it will remind you that you can't Apparate or Disapparaie inside Hogwarts
[20965]9505    Even Voldemort couldn't just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry
[20966]10116   'You didn't leave your bed, mate,' said Ron
[20967]440    I saw you thrashing around in your sleep for at least a minute before we could wake you up
[20968]6389   'Harry started pacing up and down the room again, thinking
[20969]140    What they were all saying was not only comforting, it made sense 
[20970]0   
[20971]0   
[20972]993    without really thinking, he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth
[20973]6595   I'm not the weapon after all, thought Harry
[20974]8638    His heart swelled with happiness and relief, and he felt like joining in as they heard Sirius tramping past their door towards Buckbeak's room, singing God Rest Ye, Merry Hippogriffs' at the top of his voice
[20975]163   How could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas
[20976]11565   Sirius's delight at having the house full again, and especially at having Harry back, was infectious
[20977]2172    He was no longer their sullen host of the summer; now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much, if not more than they would have done at Hogwarts, and he worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating with their help, so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognisable
[20978]7193    The tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked Sirius's family tree from view, and even the stuffed elf-heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards
[20979]8294   Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own, rather larger, pile
[20980]6324   Good haul this year,' he informed Harry through a cloud of paper
[20981]24135    Thanks for the Broom Compass, it's excellent; beats Hermione's-she got me a homework planner-'Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermione's handwriting on it
[20982]7754    She had given him, too, a book that resembled a diary except that every time he opened a page it said aloud things like: Do it today or later you'll pay
[20983]7771  'Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had superb, moving colour illustrations of all the counter-jinxes and hexes it described
[20984]6388    Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the DA
[20985]6903    Hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably supposed to be an anti-theft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off
[20986]13982    Tonks's present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry watched fly around the room, wishing he still had his full-size version; Ron had given him an enormous box of Every-Flavour Beans, Mr
[20987]369    and Mrs
[20988]7190    Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies, and Dobby a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself
[20989]3558    He had just turned it upside-down to see whether it looked better that way when, with a loud crack, Fred and George Apparated at the foot of his bed
[20990]5537   Merry Christmas,' said George
[20991]3166    Don't go downstairs for a bit
[20992]0   'Why not
[20993]7088  ' said Ron
[20994]10416   Mum's crying again,' said Fred heavily
[20995]271    Percy sent back his Christmas jumper
[20996]528   'Without a note,' added George
[20997]2834    Hasn't asked how Dad is or visited him or anything
[20998]16914   'We tried to comfort her,' said Fred, moving around the bed to look at Harry's portrait
[20999]5246    Told her Percy's nothing more than a humungous pile of rat droppings
[21000]8335   'Didn't work,' said George, helping himself to a Chocolate Frog
[21001]376    So Lupin took over
[21002]514    Best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast, I reckon
[21003]4842   'What's that supposed to be, anyway
[21004]805  ' asked Fred, squinting at Dobbys painting
[21005]1541    Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes
[21006]10482   'It's Harry
[21007]5692  ' said George, pointing at the back of the picture, says so on the back
[21008]5901  'Good likeness,' said Fred, grinning
[21009]24448    Harry threw his new homework diary at him; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily: If you've dotted the i"s and crossed the t"s then you may do whatever you please
[21010]707  'They got up and dressed
[21011]513    They could hear the various inhabitants of the house calling Merry Christmas' to one another
[21012]2065    On their way downstairs they met Hermione
[21013]10972   Thanks for the book, Harry,' she said happily
[21014]892    I've been wanting that New Theory of Numerology for ages
[21015]7055   And that perfume's really unusual, Ron
[21016]7118   'No problem,' said Ron
[21017]4750    Who's that for, anyway
[21018]236  ' he added, nodding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying
[21019]6858   Kreacher,' said Hermione brightly
[21020]203   It had better not be clothes
[21021]2028  ' Ron warned her
[21022]9189    You know what Sirius said: Kreacher knows too much, we can't set him free
[21023]10367  'It isn't clothes,' said Hermione, although if I had my way I'd certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag
[21024]5188    No, it's a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bedroom
[21025]44   'What bedroom
[21026]16984  ' said Harry, dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Sirius's mother
[21027]12317   Well, Sirius says it's not so much a bedroom, more a kind of-den,' said Hermione
[21028]179    Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen
[21029]369   'Mrs
[21030]786    Weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there
[21031]1473    She was standing at the stove and sounded as though she had a bad head cold as she wished them Merry Christmas', and they all averted their eyes
[21032]4912   So, is this Kreacher's bedroom
[21033]7750  ' said Ron, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry
[21034]6160    Harry had never seen it open
[21035]7353   Yes,' said Hermione, now sounding a little nervous
[21036]121    Er 
[21037]0   
[21038]0   
[21039]1381    I think we'd better knock
[21040]2528   'Ron rapped on the door with his knuckles but there was no reply
[21041]6056   He must be sneaking around upstairs,' he said, and without further ado pulled open the door
[21042]4    Urgh
[21043]5948  'Harry peered inside
[21044]2162    Most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and old-fashioned boiler, but in the foot of space underneath the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest
[21045]1085    A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night
[21046]228    Here and there among the material were stale bread crusts and mouldy old bits of cheese
[21047]13988    In a far corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved, magpie-like, from Sirius's purge of the house, and he had also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer
[21048]7993    Their glass might be shattered, but still the little black-and-white people inside them peered up at him haughtily, including-he felt a little jolt in his stomach-the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dumbledore's Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange
[21049]5128    By the looks of it, hers was Kreacher's favourite photograph; he had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended the glass clumsily with Spellotape
[21050]9552   I think I'll just leave his present here,' said Hermione, laying the package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing the door quietly
[21051]1334    He'll find it later, that'll be fine
[21052]8022   'Come to think of it,' said Sirius, emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door, has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately
[21053]13851  'I haven't seen him since the night we came back here,' said Harry
[21054]93    You were ordering him out of the kitchen
[21055]277   'Yeah 
[21056]0   
[21057]0   
[21058]5774   ' said Sirius, frowning
[21059]6965    You know, I think that's the last time I saw him, too 
[21060]0   
[21061]0   
[21062]76    he must be hiding upstairs somewhere
[21063]2712   'He couldn't have left, could he
[21064]10818  ' said Harry
[21065]6036    I mean, when you said out", maybe he thought you meant get out of the house
[21066]2796  'No, no, house-elves can't leave unless they're given clothes
[21067]10783    They're tied to their family's house,' said Sirius
[21068]6690   They can leave the house if they really want to,' Harry contradicted him
[21069]6596    Dobby did, he left the Malfoy's' to give me warnings two years ago
[21070]72    He had to punish himself afterwards, but he still managed it
[21071]14188   'Sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment, then said, I'll look for him later, I expect I'll find him upstairs crying his eyes out over my mother's old bloomers or something
[21072]313    Of course, he might have crawled into the airing cupboard and died 
[21073]0   
[21074]0   
[21075]2323    but I mustn't get my hopes up
[21076]5155   'Fred, George and Ron laughed; Hermione, however, looked reproachful
[21077]7914   Once they had eaten their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys, Harry and Hermione were planning to pay Mr
[21078]1073    Weasley another visit, escorted by Mad-Eye and Lupin
[21079]2304    Mundungus turned up in time for Christmas pudding and trifle, having managed to borrow' a car for the occasion, as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day
[21080]6980    The car, which Harry doubted very much had been taken with the consent of its owner, had been enlarged with a spell like the Weasleys' old Ford Anglia had once been
[21081]863    Although normally proportioned outside, ten people with Mundungus driving were able to fit into it quite comfortably
[21082]369    Mrs
[21083]13206    Weasley hesitated before getting inside-Harry knew her disapproval of Mundungus was battling with her dislike of travelling without magic-but, finally, the cold outside and her children's pleading triumphed, and she settled herself into the back seat between Fred and Bill with good grace
[21084]5374   The journey to St Mungo's was quite quick as there was very little traffic on the roads
[21085]452    A small trickle of witches and wizards was creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital
[21086]6778    Harry and the others got out of the car, and Mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them
[21087]581    They strolled casually towards the window where the dummy in green nylon stood, then, one by one, stepped through the glass
[21088]764   The reception area looked pleasantly festive: the crystal orbs that illuminated St
[21089]5766    Mungo's had been coloured red and gold to become gigantic, glowing Christmas baubles; holly hung around every doorway; and shining white Christmas trees covered in magical snow and icicles glittered in every corner, each one topped with a gleaming gold star
[21090]7205    It was less crowded than the last time they had been there, although halfway across the room Harry found himself shunted aside by a witch with a satsuma jammed up her left nostril
[21091]113   Family argument, eh
[21092]241  ' smirked the blonde witch behind the desk
[21093]940    You're the third I've seen today

[21095]0   
[21096]376    Spell Damage, fourth floor
[21097]1878   'They found Mr Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his turkey dinner on a tray on his lap and a rather sheepish expression on his face
[21098]623   Everything all right, Arthur
[21099]725  ' asked Mrs
[21100]1022    Weasley, after they had all greeted Mr
[21101]682    Weasley and handed over their presents
[21102]5608   Fine, fine,' said Mr
[21103]936    Weasley, a little too heartily
[21104]2767    You-er-haven't seen Healer Smethwyck, have you
[21105]6102  'No,' said Mrs Weasley suspiciously, why
[21106]5458  'Nothing, nothing,' said Mr
[21107]715    Weasley airily, starting to unwrap his pile of gifts
[21108]504    Well, everyone had a good day
[21109]733   What did you all get for Christmas
[21110]6142   Oh, Harry- this is absolutely wonderful
[21111]11478  ' For he had just opened Harry's gift of fuse-wire and screwdrivers
[21112]369   Mrs
[21113]1707    Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr
[21114]5459    Weasley's answer
[21115]10915    As her husband leaned over to shake Harry's hand, she peered at the bandaging under his nightshirt
[21116]7173   Arthur,' she said, with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap, you've had your bandages changed
[21117]302    Why have you had your bandages changed a day early, Arthur
[21118]3149   They told me they wouldn't need doing until tomorrow
[21119]0   'What
[21120]7066  ' said Mr Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up his chest
[21121]9870    No, no-it's nothing-it's-I-'He seemed to deflate under Mrs
[21122]5410    Weasley's piercing gaze
[21123]3118   Well-now don't get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an idea 
[21124]0   
[21125]0

[21132]5    complementary medicine 
[21133]0   
[21134]0   
[21135]520    I mean, some of these old Muggle remedies 
[21136]0   
[21137]0   
[21138]739    well, they're called stitches, Molly, and they work very well on-on Muggle wounds-'Mrs
[21139]1054    Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl
[21140]1793    Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around Mr
[21141]1827    Weasley; Bill muttered something about getting himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him, grinning
[21142]6018   Do you mean to tell me,' said Mrs
[21143]1589    Weasley, her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover, that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies
[21144]5599  'Not messing about, Molly, dear,' said Mr
[21145]6564    Weasley imploringly, it was just-just something Pye and I thought we'd try-only, most unfortunately-well, with these particular kinds of wounds-it doesn't seem to work as well as we'd hoped-'Meaning
[21146]0  'Well 
[21147]0   
[21148]0   
[21149]4486    well, I don't know whether you know what-what stitches are
[21150]6445  ' It sounds as though you've been trying to sew your skin back together,' said Mrs
[21151]14419    Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter, but even you, Arthur, wouldn't be that stupid -'I fancy a cup of tea, too,' said Harry, jumping to his feet
[21152]4472   Hermione, Ron and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him
[21153]781    As it swung closed behind them, they heard Mrs
[21154]5751    Weasley shriek, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THAT'S THE GENERAL IDEA
[21155]6374  'Typical Dad,' said Ginny, shaking her head as they set off up the corridor
[21156]3    Stitches 
[21157]0   
[21158]0   
[21159]110    I ask you 
[21160]0   
[21161]0   
[21162]7706   'Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,' said Hermione fairly
[21163]4886    I suppose something in that snake's venom dissolves them or something
[21164]33    I wonder where the tearoom is
[21165]16091  'Fifth floor,' said Harry, remembering the sign over the welcomewitch's desk
[21166]1263   They walked along the corridor, through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of brutal-looking Healers
[21167]290    As they climbed it, the various Healers called out to them, diagnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies
[21168]2537    Ron was seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad case of spattergroit
[21169]4842   And what's that supposed to be
[21170]863  ' he asked angrily, as the Healer pursued him through six more portraits, shoving the occupants out of the way
[21171]361   ' Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin, young master, that will leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now-'Watch who you're calling gruesome
[21172]7357  ' said Ron, his ears turning red
[21173]1361   -the only remedy is to take the liver of a toad, bind it tight about your throat, stand naked at the full moon in a barrel of eels' eyes-'I have not got spattergroit
[21174]92  'But the unsightly blemishes upon your visage, young master-'They're freckles
[21175]7137  ' said Ron furiously
[21176]166    Now get back in your own picture and leave me alone
[21177]198  'He rounded on the others, who were all keeping determinedly straight faces
[21178]5020   What floor's this
[21179]12047  'I think it's the fifth,' said Hermione
[21180]16988   Nah, it's the fourth,' said Harry, one more-'But as he stepped on to the landing he came to an abrupt halt, staring at the small window set into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted SPELL DAMAGE
[21181]380    A man was peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass
[21182]1016    He had wavy blond hair, bright blue eyes and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth
[21183]17   Blimey
[21184]7386  ' said Ron, also staring at the man
[21185]7221   Oh, my goodness,' said Hermione suddenly, sounding breathless
[21186]955    Professor Lockhart
[21187]1432   'Their ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher pushed open the doors and moved towards them, wearing a long lilac dressing gown
[21188]36   Well, hello there
[21189]5086  ' he said
[21190]1415    I expect you'd like my autograph, would you
[21191]2390  ' Hasn't changed much, has he
[21192]6190  ' Harry muttered to Ginny, who grinned
[21193]872   Er-how are you, Professor
[21194]7314  ' said Ron, sounding slightly guilty
[21195]13022    It had been Ron's malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor Lockhart's memory so badly that he had landed in St
[21196]28748    Mungo's in the first place, though as Lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe Harry and Ron's memories at the time, Harry's sympathy was limited
[21197]481   I'm very well indeed, thank you
[21198]5425  ' said Lockhart exuberantly, palling a rather battered peacock-feather quill from his pocket
[21199]738    Now, how many autographs would you like
[21200]854   I can do joined-up writing now, you know
[21201]17761  'Er-we don't want any at the moment, thanks,' said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry, who asked, Professor, should you be wandering around the corridors
[21202]2356   Shouldn't you be in a ward
[21203]5713  'The smile faded slowly from Lockhart's face
[21204]13383    For a few moments he gazed intently at Harry, then he said, Haven't we met
[21205]121  'Er 
[21206]0   
[21207]0   
[21208]11095    yeah, we have,' said Harry
[21209]451    You used to teach us at Hogwarts, remember
[21210]36  'Teach
[21211]881  ' repeated Lockhart, looking faintly unsettled
[21212]0    Me
[21213]667   Did I
[21214]741  'And then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it was rather alarming
[21215]1510   Taught you everything you know, I expect, did I
[21216]4   Well, how about those autographs, then
[21217]1044   Shall we say a round dozen, you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left out
[21218]3128  'But just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice called, Gilderoy, you naughty boy, where have you wandered off to
[21219]7022  'A motherly-looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came bustling up the corridor, smiling warmly at Harry and the others
[21220]1802   Oh, Gilderoy, you've got visitors
[21221]242   How lovely, and on Christmas Day, too
[21222]10821   Do you know, he never gets visitors, poor lamb, and I can't think why, he's such a sweetie, aren't you
[21223]186  'We're doing autographs
[21224]509  ' Gilderoy told the Healer with another glittering smile
[21225]2881    They want loads of them, won't take no for an answer
[21226]2266   I just hope we've got enough photographs
[21227]10786  'Listen to him,' said the Healer, taking Lockhart's arm and beaming fondly at him as though he were a precocious two-year-old
[21228]1013    He was rather well known a few years ago; we very much hope that this liking for giving autographs is a sign that his memory might be starting to come back
[21229]393    Will you step this way
[21230]11207   He's in a closed ward, you know, he must have slipped out while I was bringing in the Christmas presents, the door's usually kept locked 
[21231]0   
[21232]0   
[21233]4797    not that he's dangerous
[21234]5579   But,' she lowered her voice to a whisper, he's a bit of a danger to himself, bless him 
[21235]0   
[21236]0   
[21237]5604    doesn't know who he is, you see, wanders off and can't remember how to get back 
[21238]0   
[21239]0   
[21240]492    it is nice of you to have come to see him
[21241]16245   'Er,' said Ron, gesturing uselessly at the floor above, actually, we were just-er-'But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and Ron's feeble mutter of going to have a cup of tea' trailed away into nothingness
[21242]1146    They looked at each other helplessly, then followed Lockhart and his Healer along the corridor
[21243]12719   Let's not stay long,' Ron said quietly
[21244]1152   The Healer pointed her wand at the door of the Janus Thickey Ward and muttered, Alohomora
[21245]6563   ' The door swung open and she led the way inside, keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoy's arm until she had settled him into an armchair beside his bed
[21246]10743   This is our long-term residents' ward,' she informed Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny in a low voice
[21247]861    For permanent spell damage, you know
[21248]558    Of course, with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck, we can produce some improvement
[21249]1593    Gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself; and we've seen a real improvement in Mr
[21250]2557    Bode, he seems to be regaining the power of speech very well, though he isn't speaking any language we recognise yet
[21251]865    Well, I must finish giving out the Christmas presents, I'll leave you all to chat
[21252]6408   'Harry looked around
[21253]161    The ward bore unmistakeable signs of being a permanent home to its residents
[21254]10988    They had many more personal effects around their beds than in Mr Weasley's ward; the wall around Gilderoy's headboard, for instance, was papered with pictures of himself, all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals
[21255]54    He had autographed many of them to himself in disjointed, childish writing
[21256]928    The moment he had been deposited in his chair by the Healer, Gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs towards him, seized a quill and started signing them all feverishly
[21257]5606   You can put them in envelopes,' he said to Ginny, throwing the signed pictures into her lap one by one as he finished them
[21258]1138    I am not forgotten, you know, no, I still receive a very great deal of fan mail

[21271]1521   'A sallow-skinned, mournful-looking wizard lay in the bed opposite staring at the ceiling; he was mumbling to himself and seemed quite unaware of anything around him
[21272]8518    Two beds along was a woman whose entire head was covered in fur; Harry remembered something similar happening to Hermione during their second year, although fortunately the damage, in her case, had not been permanent
[21273]471    At the far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds to give the occupants and their visitors some privacy
[21274]5523   Here you are, Agnes,' said the Healer brightly to the furry-faced woman, handing her a small pile of Christmas presents
[21275]41    See, not forgotten, are you
[21276]17253   And your son's sent an owl to say he's visiting tonight, so that's nice, isn't it
[21277]321  'Agnes gave several loud barks
[21278]4515   And look, Broderick, you've been sent a pot plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy hippogriff for each month; they'll brighten things up, won't they
[21279]6270  ' said the Healer, bustling along to the mumbling man, setting a rather ugly plant with long, swaying tentacles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her wand
[21280]731    And-oh, Mrs
[21281]103    Longbottom, are you leaving already
[21282]11104  'Harry's head span round
[21283]2998    The curtains had been drawn back from the two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking back down the aisle between the beds: a formidable-looking old witch wearing a long green dress, a moth-eaten fox fur and a pointed hat decorated with what was unmistakeably a stuffed vulture and, trailing behind her looking thoroughly depressed-Neville
[21284]6392   With a sudden rush of understanding, Harry realised who the people in the end beds must be
[21285]9672    He cast around wildly for some means of distracting the others so that Neville could leave the ward unnoticed and unquestioned, but Ron had also looked up at the sound of the name Longbottom', and before Harry could stop him had called out, Neville
[21286]399  'Neville jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly missed him
[21287]5056   It's us, Neville
[21288]7484  ' said Ron brightly, getting to his feet
[21289]183    Have you seen-
[21290]4954   Lockhart's here
[21291]696   Who've you been visiting
[21292]456  'Friends of yours, Neville, dear
[21293]10164  ' said Neville's grandmother graciously, bearing down upon them all
[21294]1040   Neville looked as though he would rather be anywhere in the world but here
[21295]907    A dull purple flush was creeping up his plump face and he was not making eye contact with any of them
[21296]12220   Ah, yes,' said his grandmother, looking closely at Harry and sticking out a shrivelled, clawlike hand for him to shake
[21297]1572    Yes, yes, I know who you are, of course
[21298]342    Neville speaks most highly of you
[21299]11250   'Er-thanks,' said Harry, shaking hands
[21300]2226    Neville did not look at him, but surveyed his own feet, the colour deepening in his face all the while
[21301]482   And you two are clearly Weasleys,' Mrs
[21302]2890    Longbottom continued, proffering her hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn
[21303]2114    Yes, I know your parents-not well, of course-but fine people, fine people 
[21304]0   
[21305]0   
[21306]1664    and you must be Hermione Granger
[21307]2669  ' Hermione looked rather startled that Mrs
[21308]555    Longbottom knew her name, but shook hands all the same
[21309]5670   Yes, Neville's told me all about you
[21310]2466    Helped him out of a few sticky spots, haven't you
[21311]19875   He's a good boy,' she said, casting a sternly appraising look down her rather bony nose at Neville, but be hasn't got his father's talent, I'm afraid to say
[21312]951   ' And she jerked her head in the direction of the two beds at the end of the ward, so that the stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly
[21313]0   What
[21314]7704  ' said Ron, looking amazed
[21315]13291    (Harry wanted to stamp on Ron's foot, but that sort of thing is much harder to bring off unnoticed when you're wearing jeans rather than robes
[21316]635   ) Is that your dad down the end, Neville
[21317]4750  'What's this
[21318]5455  ' said Mrs
[21319]91    Longbottom sharply
[21320]3186    Haven't you told your friends about your parents, Neville
[21321]1989  'Neville took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling and shook his head
[21322]7259    Harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone, but he could not think of any way of helping Neville out of the situation
[21323]4762   Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of
[21324]5455  ' said Mrs
[21325]119    Longbottom angrily
[21326]332    You should be proud, Neville, proud
[21327]3537  They didn't give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them, you know
[21328]12199  'I'm not ashamed,' said Neville, very faintly, still looking anywhere but at Harry and the others
[21329]2634    Ron was now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitants of the two beds
[21330]1824   Well, you've got a funny way of showing it
[21331]5455  ' said Mrs
[21332]36    Longbottom
[21333]20463    My son and his wife,' she said, turning haughtily to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny, were tortured into insanity by You-Know-Who's followers
[21334]2155   'Hermione and Ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths
[21335]8047    Ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of Neville's parents and looked mortified
[21336]1442   They were Aurors, you know, and very well respected within the wizarding community,' Mrs Longbottom went on
[21337]93    Highly gifted, the pair of them
[21338]388    I-yes, Alice dear, what is it
[21339]5615  'Neville's mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress
[21340]12448    She no longer had the plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in Moody's old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix
[21341]2285    Her face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge and her hair, which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking
[21342]1971    She did not seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made timid motions towards Neville, holding something in her outstretched hand
[21343]0   Again
[21344]5696  ' said Mrs Longbottom, sounding slightly weary
[21345]402    Very well, Alice dear, very well- Neville, take it, whatever it is
[21346]5716   'But Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his mother dropped an empty Drooble's Best Blowing Gum wrapper
[21347]11059   Very nice, dear,' said Neville's grandmother in a falsely cheery voice, patting his mother on the shoulder
[21348]5648   But Neville said quietly, Thanks, Mum
[21349]465   'His mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to herself
[21350]8832    Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he'd ever found anything less funny in his life
[21351]1205   Well, we'd better get back,' sighed Mrs
[21352]510    Longbottom, drawing on long green gloves
[21353]120    Very nice to have met you all
[21354]513    Neville, put that wrapper in the bin, she must have given you enough of them to paper your bedroom by now
[21355]6945   'But as they left, Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the sweet wrapper into his pocket
[21356]600   The door closed behind them
[21357]7658   I never knew,' said Hermione, who looked tearful
[21358]7765   Nor did I,' said Ron rather hoarsely
[21359]459   Nor me,' whispered Ginny
[21360]6408   They all looked at Harry
[21361]5762   I did,' he said glumly
[21362]3904    Dumbledore told me but I promised I wouldn't tell anyone 
[21363]0   
[21364]0   
[21365]10902    that's what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for, using the Cruciatus Curse on Neville's parents until they lost their minds
[21366]736   'Bellatrix Lestrange did that
[21367]1756  ' whispered Hermione, horrified
[21368]5624    That woman Kreacher's got a photo of in his den
[21369]6031  'There was a long silence, broken by Lockhart's angry voice

[21380]139     Kreacher, it transpired, had been lurking in the attic
[21381]6808    Sirius said he had found him up there, covered in dust, no doubt looking for more relics of the Black family to hide in his cupboard
[21382]6471    Though Sirius seemed satisfied with this story, it made Harry uneasy
[21383]14093    Kreacher seemed to be in a better mood on his reappearance, his bitter muttering had subsided somewhat and he submitted to orders more docilely than usual, though once or twice Harry caught the house-elf staring at him avidly, but always looking quickly away whenever he saw that Harry had noticed
[21384]7237   Harry did not mention his vague suspicions to Sirius, whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that Christmas was over
[21385]713    As the date of their departure back to Hogwarts drew nearer, he became more and more prone to what Mrs
[21386]6580    Weasley called fits of the sullens', in which he would become taciturn and grumpy, often withdrawing to Buckbeak's room for hours at a time
[21387]978    His gloom seeped through the house, oozing under doorways like some noxious gas, so that all of them became infected by it
[21388]11316   Harry didn't want to leave Sirius again with only Kreacher for company; in fact, for the first time in his life, he was not looking forward to returning to Hogwarts
[21389]3421    Going back to school would mean placing himself once again under the tyranny of Dolores Umbridge, who had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decrees in their absence; there was no Quidditch to look forward to now that he had been banned, there was every likelihood that their burden of homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer; and Dumbledore remained as remote as ever
[21390]10217    In fact, if it hadn't been for the DA, Harry thought he might have begged Sirius to let him leave Hogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place
[21391]6382   Then, on the very last day of the holidays, something happened that made Harry positively dread his return to school
[21392]11277   Harry, dear,' said Mrs
[21393]10776    Weasley poking her head into his and Ron's bedroom, where the pair of them were playing wizard chess watched by Hermione, Ginny and Crookshanks, could you come down to the kitchen
[21394]2044   Professor Snape would like a word with you
[21395]18319   'Harry did not immediately register what she had said; one of his castles was engaged in a violent tussle with a pawn of Ron's and he was egging it on enthusiastically
[21396]4774   Squash him- squash him, he's only a pawn, you idiot
[21397]464    Sorry, Mrs
[21398]1573    Weasley, what did you say
[21399]1321  'Professor Snape, dear
[21400]84    In the kitchen
[21401]1434    He'd like a word
[21402]11079   'Harry's mouth fell open in horror
[21403]4638    He looked around at Ron, Hermione and Ginny, all of whom were gaping back at him
[21404]2275    Crookshanks, whom Hermione had been restraining with difficulty for the past quarter of an hour, leapt gleefully on to the board and set the pieces running for cover, squealing at the top of their voices
[21405]480   Snape
[21406]10840  ' said Harry blankly
[21407]6776   Professor Snape, dear,' said Mrs
[21408]639    Weasley reprovingly
[21409]3409    Now come on, quickly, he says he can't stay long
[21410]5085   'What's he want with you
[21411]8066  ' said Ron, looking unnerved as Mrs
[21412]1093    Weasley withdrew from the room
[21413]2438    You haven't done anything, have you
[21414]0  'No
[21415]12323  ' said Harry indignantly, racking his brains to think what he could have done that would make Snape pursue him to Grimmauld Place
[21416]2420    Had his last piece of homework perhaps earned a T'
[21417]2901  A minute or two later, he pushed open the kitchen door to find Sirius and Snape both seated at the long kitchen table, glaring in opposite directions
[21418]139    The silence between them was heavy with mutual dislike
[21419]1265    A letter lay open on the table in front of Sirius
[21420]10957   Er,' said Harry, to announce his presence
[21421]2125   Snape looked around at him, his face framed between curtains of greasy black hair
[21422]504   Sit down, Potter
[21423]11379   'You know,' said Sirius loudly, leaning back on his rear chair legs and speaking to the ceiling, I think I'd prefer it if you didn't give orders here, Snape
[21424]4962    It's my house, you see
[21425]5803   'An ugly flush suffused Snape's pallid face
[21426]7339    Harry sat down in a chair beside Sirius, facing Snape across the table
[21427]12800   I was supposed to see you alone, Potter,' said Snape, the familiar sneer curling his mouth, but Black-'I'm his godfather,' said Sirius, louder than ever
[21428]5581   I am here on Dumbledore's orders
[21429]8231   ' said Snape, whose voice, by contrast, was becoming more and more quietly waspish, but by all means stay, Black, I know you like to feel 
[21430]0   
[21431]0   
[21432]6    involved
[21433]5073   'What's that supposed to mean
[21434]6081  ' said Sirius, letting his chair fall back on to all four legs with a loud bang
[21435]1291   Merely that I am sure you must feel-ah-frustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful,' Snape laid a delicate stress on the word, for the Order
[21436]5475   'It was Sirius's turn to flush
[21437]11347    Snape's lip curled in triumph as he turned to Harry
[21438]1076   The Headmaster has sent me to tell you, Potter, that it is his wish for you to study Occlumency this term
[21439]26   'Study what
[21440]10840  ' said Harry blankly
[21441]5246   Snape's sneer became more pronounced
[21442]497   Occlumency, Potter
[21443]328    The magical defence of the mind against external penetration
[21444]277    An obscure branch of magic, but a highly useful one
[21445]10777   'Harry's heart began to pump very fast indeed
[21446]73    Defence against external penetration
[21447]25   But he was not being possessed, they had all agreed on that 
[21448]0   
[21449]0   
[21450]212   Why do I have to study Occlu-thing
[21451]2  ' he blurted out
[21452]6144   Because the Headmaster thinks it a good idea,' said Snape smoothly
[21453]1280    You will receive private lessons once a week, but you will not tell anybody what you are doing, least of all Dolores Umbridge
[21454]88    You understand
[21455]11110  'Yes,' said Harry
[21456]5266    Who's going to be teaching me
[21457]605  'Snape raised an eyebrow
[21458]5086   I am,' he said
[21459]5825   Harry had the horrible sensation that his insides were melting
[21460]606   Extra lessons with Snape-what on earth had he done to deserve this
[21461]1625   He looked quickly round at Sirius for support
[21462]8893   Why can't Dumbledore teach Harry
[21463]1010  ' asked Sirius aggressively
[21464]0    Why you
[21465]10447  ' I suppose because it is a headmaster's privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks,' said Snape silkily
[21466]725    I assure you I did not beg for the job
[21467]934   ' He got to his feet
[21468]773    I will expect you at six o'clock on Monday evening, Potter
[21469]170    My office
[21470]219    If anybody asks, you are taking remedial Potions
[21471]399    Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them
[21472]793   'He turned to leave, his black travelling cloak billowing behind him
[21473]6316   Wait a moment,' said Sirius, sitting up straighter in his chair
[21474]1344   Snape turned back to face them, sneering
[21475]274   I am in rather a hurry, Black
[21476]573    Unlike you, I do not have unlimited leisure time
[21477]6534   'I'll get to the point, then,' said Sirius, standing up
[21478]12830    He was rather taller than Snape who, Harry noticed, balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what Harry was sure was the handle of his wand
[21479]7414    If I hear you're using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard time, you'll have me to answer to
[21480]502   'How touching,' Snape sneered
[21481]1393    But surely you have noticed that Potter is very like his father
[21482]6036  'Yes, I have,' said Sirius proudly
[21483]11711   Well then, you'll know he's so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him,' Snape said sleekly
[21484]2264   Sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table towards Snape, pulling out his wand as he went
[21485]493    Snape whipped out his own
[21486]8589    They were squaring up to each other, Sirius looking livid, Snape calculating, his eyes darting from Sirius's wand-tip to his face
[21487]647   Sirius
[21488]11882  ' said Harry loudly, but Sirius appeared not to hear him
[21489]21508   I've warned you, Snivelus,' said Sirius, his face barely a foot from Snape's, I don't care if Dumbledore thinks you've reformed, I know better-' Oh, but why don't you tell him so
[21490]603  ' whispered Snape
[21491]5535    Or are you afraid he might not take very seriously the advice of a man who has been hiding inside his mother's house for six months
[21492]902  'Tell me, how is Lucius Malfoy these days
[21493]12258   I expect he's delighted his lapdog's working at Hogwarts, isn't he
[21494]8590  'Speaking of dogs,' said Snape softly, did you know that Lucius Malfoy recognised you last time you risked a little jaunt outside
[21495]731   Clever idea, Black, getting yourself seen on a safe station platform 
[21496]0   
[21497]0   
[21498]3170    gave you a cast-iron excuse not to leave your hidey-hole in future, didn't it
[21499]1178  'Sirius raised his wand
[21500]0   NO
[21501]6251  ' Harry yelled, vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them
[21502]3588    Sirius, don't
[21503]24  'Are you calling me a coward
[21504]12758  ' roared Sirius, trying to push Harry out of the way, but Harry would not budge
[21505]5921   Why, yes, I suppose I am,' said Snape
[21506]5732   Harry-get- out-of-it
[21507]1156  ' snarled Sirius, pushing him aside with his free hand
[21508]4546   The kitchen door opened and the entire Weasley family, plus Hermione, came inside, all looking very happy, with Mr
[21509]872    Weasley walking proudly in their midst dressed in a pair of striped pyjamas covered by a mackintosh
[21510]6   Cured
[21511]345  ' he announced brightly to the kitchen at large
[21512]66    Completely cured
[21513]13771  ' He and all the other Weasleys froze on the threshold, gazing at the scene in front of them, which was also suspended in mid-action, both Sirius and Snape looking towards the door with their wands pointing into each other's faces and Harry immobile between them, a hand stretched out to each, trying to force them apart
[21514]10246   Merlin's beard,' said Mr
[21515]6509    Weasley, the smile sliding off his face, what's going on here
[21516]1202  'Both Sirius and Snape lowered their wands
[21517]6408    Harry looked from one to the other
[21518]219    Each wore an expression of utmost contempt, yet the unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought them to their senses
[21519]1447    Snape pocketed his wand, turned on his heel and swept back across the kitchen, passing the Weasleys without comment
[21520]1174    At the door he looked back
[21521]717   Six o'clock, Monday evening, Potter
[21522]129   'And he was gone
[21523]1084    Sirius glared after him, his wand at his side
[21524]5239   What's been going on
[21525]728  ' asked Mr
[21526]636    Weasley again
[21527]7135   Nothing, Arthur,' said Sirius, who was breathing heavily as though he had just run a long distance
[21528]1594    Just a friendly little chat between two old school friends
[21529]1516   ' With what looked like an enormous effort, he smiled
[21530]0    So 
[21531]0   
[21532]0   
[21533]6    you're cured
[21534]5606   That's great news, really great
[21535]2701   'Yes, isn't it
[21536]5455  ' said Mrs
[21537]844    Weasley, leading her husband forward to a chair
[21538]13544    Healer Smethwyck worked his magic in the end, found an antidote to whatever that snake's got in its fangs, and Arthur's learned his lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine, haven't you, dear
[21539]99  ' she added, rather menacingly
[21540]5882   Yes, Molly dear,' said Mr
[21541]637    Weasley meekly
[21542]5335   That night's meal should have been a cheerful one, with Mr
[21543]636    Weasley back amongst them
[21544]13798    Harry could tell Sirius was trying to make it so, yet when his godfather was not forcing himself to laugh loudly at Fred and George's jokes or offering everyone more food, his face fell back into a moody, brooding expression
[21545]6498    Harry was separated from him by Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who had dropped in to offer Mr
[21546]642    Weasley their congratulations
[21547]15397    He wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell him he shouldn't listen to a word Snape said, that Snape was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them didn't think Sirius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him and remaining in Grimmauld Place
[21548]12332    But he had no opportunity to do so, and, eyeing the ugly look on Sirius's face, Harry wondered occasionally whether he would have dared to mention it even if he had the chance
[21549]5227    Instead, he told Ron and Hermione under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons with Snape
[21550]8058   Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort,' said Hermione at once
[21551]2539    Well, you won't be sorry not to have them any more, will you
[21552]564  'Extra lessons with Snape
[21553]7134  ' said Ron, sounding aghast
[21554]626    I'd rather have the nightmares
[21555]10633  'They were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the following day, escorted once again by Tonks and Lupin, both of whom were eating breakfast in the kitchen when Harry, Ron and Hermione came down next morning
[21556]7964    The adults seemed to have been mid-way through a whispered conversation as Harry opened the door; all of them looked round hastily and fell silent
[21557]453   After a hurried breakfast, they all pulled on jackets and scarves against the chilly grey January morning
[21558]7754    Harry had an unpleasant constricted sensation in his chest; he did not want to say goodbye to Sirius
[21559]17284    He had a bad feeling about this parting; he didn't know when they would next see each other and he felt it was incumbent upon him to say something to Sirius to stop him doing anything stupid-Harry was worried that Snape's accusation of cowardice had stung Sirius so badly he might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond Grimmauld Place
[21560]1490    Before he could think of what to say, however, Sirius had beckoned him to his side
[21561]16400   I want you to take this,' he said quietly, thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into Harry's hands
[21562]0   What is it
[21563]6088  ' Harry asked
[21564]7170   A way of letting me know if Snape's giving you a hard time
[21565]3186    No, don't open it in here
[21566]6564  ' said Sirius, with a wary look at Mrs
[21567]1280    Weasley, who was trying to persuade the twins to wear hand-knitted mittens
[21568]1249    I doubt Molly would approve-but I want you to use it if you need me, all right
[21569]11889  'OK,' said Harry, stowing the package away in the inside pocket of his jacket, but he knew he would never use whatever it was
[21570]7216    It would not be he, Harry, who lured Sirius from his place of safety, no matter how foully Snape treated him in their forthcoming Occlumency classes
[21571]23453   Let's go, then,' said Sirius, clapping Harry on the shoulder and smiling grimly, and before Harry could say anything else, they were heading upstairs, stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front door, surrounded by Weasleys
[21572]11272   Goodbye, Harry, take care,' said Mrs
[21573]641    Weasley, hugging him
[21574]5894   See you, Harry, and keep an eye out for snakes for me
[21575]5458  ' said Mr
[21576]1091    Weasley genially, shaking his hand
[21577]26493   Right-yeah,' said Harry distractedly; it was his last chance to tell Sirius to be careful; he turned, looked into his godfather's face and opened his mouth to speak, but before he could do so Sirius was giving him a brief, one-armed hug, and saying gruffly, Look after yourself, Harry
[21578]6774   ' Next moment, Harry found himself being shunted out into the icy winter air, with Tonks (today heavily disguised as a tall, tweedy woman with iron-grey hair) chivvying him down the steps
[21579]702   The door of number twelve slammed shut behind them
[21580]355    They followed Lupin down the front steps
[21581]6674    As he reached the pavement, Harry looked round
[21582]287    Number twelve was shrinking rapidly as those on either side of it stretched sideways, squeezing it out of sight
[21583]258    One blink later, it had gone
[21584]12070   Come on, the quicker we get on the bus the better,' said Tonks, and Harry thought there was nervousness in the glance she threw around the square
[21585]858    Lupin flung out his right arm
[21586]26   BANG
[21587]832   A violently purple, triple-decker bus had appeared out of thin air in front of them, narrowly avoiding the nearest lamppost, which jumped backwards out of its way
[21588]11831   A thin, pimply, jug-eared youth in a purple uniform leapt down on to the pavement and said, Welcome to the-'Yes, yes, we know, thank you,' said Tonks swiftly
[21589]11886    On, on, get on-' And she shoved Harry forwards towards the steps, past the conductor, who goggled at Harry as he passed
[21590]4759   ' Ere-it's Arry-
[21591]2295  'If you shout his name I will curse you into oblivion,' muttered Tonks menacingly, now shunting Ginny and Hermione forwards
[21592]14543   I've always wanted to go on this thing,' said Ron happily, joining Harry on board and looking around
[21593]6428   It had been evening the last time Harry had travelled by Knight Bus and its three decks had been full of brass bedsteads
[21594]257    Now, in the early morning, it was crammed with an assortment of mismatched chairs grouped haphazardly around windows
[21595]6287    Some of these appeared to have fallen over when the bus stopped abruptly in Grimmauld Place; a few witches and wizards were still getting to their feet, grumbling, and somebody's shopping bag had slid the length of the bus: an unpleasant mixture of frogspawn, cockroaches and custard creams was scattered all over the floor
[21596]7231   Looks like we'll have to split up,' said Tonks briskly, looking a
[21597]151   round for empty chairs
[21598]1979    Fred, George and Ginny, if you just take those seats at the back 
[21599]0   
[21600]0   
[21601]81    Remus can stay with you
[21602]9412   'She, Harry, Ron and Hermione proceeded up to the very top deck, where there were two unoccupied chairs at the very front of the bus and two at the back
[21603]7915    Stan Shunpike, the conductor, followed Harry and Ron eagerly to the back
[21604]6749    Heads turned as Harry passed and, when he sat down, he saw all the faces flick back to the front again
[21605]7960   As Harry and Ron handed Stan eleven Sickles each, the bus set off again, swaying ominously
[21606]14572    It rumbled around Grimmauld Place, weaving on and off the pavement, then, with another tremendous BANG, they were all flung backwards; Ron's chair toppled right over and Pigwidgeon, who had been on his lap, burst out of his cage and flew twittering wildly up to the front of the bus where he fluttered down on to Hermione's shoulder instead
[21607]6757    Harry, who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket, looked out of the window: they were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway
[21608]18904   Just outside Birmingham,' said Stan happily, answering Harry's unasked question as Ron struggled up from the floor
[21609]12    You keepin' well, then, Arry
[21610]2732   I seen your name in the paper loads over the summer, but it weren't never nuffink very nice
[21611]14531    I said to Ern, I said, e didn't seem like a nutter when we met im, just goes to show, dunnit
[21612]5878  'He handed over their tickets and continued to gaze, enthralled, at Harry
[21613]933    Apparently, Stan did not care how nutty somebody was, if they were famous enough to be in the paper
[21614]310    The Knight Bus swayed alarmingly, overtaking a line of cars on the inside
[21615]9172    Looking towards the front of the bus, Harry saw Hermione cover her eyes with her hands, Pigwidgeon swaying happily on her shoulder
[21616]26   BANG
[21617]265   Chairs slid backwards again as the Knight Bus jumped from the Birmingham motorway to a quiet country lane full of hairpin bends
[21618]401    Hedgerows on either side of the road were leaping out of their way as they mounted the verges
[21619]1093    From here they moved to a main street in the middle of a busy town, then to a viaduct surrounded by tall hills, then to a windswept road between high-rise flats, each time with a loud BANG
[21620]4363   I've changed my mind,' muttered Ron, picking himself up from the floor for the sixth time, I never want to ride on this thing again
[21621]10102   'Listen, it's Ogwarts stop after this,' said Stan brightly, swaying towards them
[21622]5911    That bossy woman up front oo got on with you, she's given us a little tip to move you up the queue
[21623]6748    We're just gonna let Madam Marsh off first, though-there was a retching sound from downstairs, followed by a horrible spattering noise- she's not feeling er best
[21624]984   'A few minutes later, the Knight Bus screeched to a halt outside a small pub, which squeezed itself out of the way to avoid a collision
[21625]533    They could hear Stan ushering the unfortunate Madam Marsh out of the bus and the relieved murmurings of her fellow passengers on the second deck
[21626]152    The bus moved on again, gathering speed, until-BANG
[21627]52   They were rolling through a snowy Hogsmeade
[21628]16496    Harry caught a glimpse of the Hog's Head down its side street, the severed boar's head sign creaking in the wintry wind
[21629]529    Flecks of snow hit the large window at the front of the bus
[21630]437    At last they rolled to a halt outside the gates to Hogwarts
[21631]1288   Lupin and Tonks helped them off the bus with their luggage, then got off to say goodbye
[21632]6424    Harry glanced up at the three decks of the Knight Bus and saw all the passengers staring down at them, noses flat against the windows
[21633]6090   You'll be safe once you're in the grounds,' said Tonks, casting a careful eye around at the deserted road
[21634]464    Have a good term, OK
[21635]11846  'Look after yourselves,' said Lupin, shaking hands all round and reaching Harry last
[21636]75    And listen 
[21637]0   
[21638]0   
[21639]13362   ' he lowered his voice while the rest of them exchanged last-minute goodbyes with Tonks, Harry, I know you don't like Snape, but he is a superb Occlumens and we all-Sirius included-want you to learn to protect yourself, so work hard, all right
[21640]17759  'Yeah, all right,' said Harry heavily, looking up into Lupin's prematurely lined face
[21641]0    See you, then
[21642]206   'The six of them struggled up the slippery drive towards the castle, dragging their trunks
[21643]1895    Hermione was already talking about knitting a few elf hats before bedtime
[21644]6712    Harry glanced back when they reached the oaken front doors; the Knight Bus had already gone and he half-wished, given what was coming the following evening, that he was still on board
[21645]6021   Harry spent most of the next day dreading the evening
[21646]1426    His morning double-Potions lesson did nothing to dispel his trepidation, as Snape was as unpleasant as ever
[21647]536    His mood was further lowered by the DA members constantly approaching him in the corridors between classes, asking hopefully if there would be a meeting that night
[21648]16844   I'll let you know in the usual way when the next one is,' Harry said over and over again, but I can't do it tonight, I've got to go to-er-remedial Potions
[21649]65   'You take remedial Potions
[21650]6546  ' asked Zacharias Smith superciliously, having cornered Harry in the Entrance Hall after lunch
[21651]469    Good Lord, you must be terrible
[21652]3108    Snape doesn't usually give extra lessons, does he
[21653]2457  'As Smith strode away in an annoyingly buoyant fashion, Ron glared after him
[21654]24   Shall I jinx him
[21655]10551   I can still get him from here,' he said, raising his wand and taking aim between Smith's shoulder blades
[21656]10844   Forget it,' said Harry dismally
[21657]12960    It's what everyone's going to think, isn't it
[21658]12114   That I'm really stup-'Hi, Harry,' said a voice behind him
[21659]756    He turned round and found Cho standing there
[21660]11301   Oh,' said Harry as his stomach leapt uncomfortably
[21661]26    Hi
[21662]15259   'We'll be in the library, Harry,' said Hermione firmly as she seized Ron above the elbow and dragged him off towards the marble staircase
[21663]409   Had a good Christmas
[21664]506  ' asked Cho
[21665]11187   Yeah, not bad,' said Harry
[21666]5305   Mine was pretty quiet,' said Cho
[21667]655    For some reason, she was looking rather embarrassed
[21668]13    Erm 
[21669]0   
[21670]0   
[21671]5522    there's another Hogsmeade trip next month, did you see the notice
[21672]0  'What
[21673]3514   Oh, no, I haven't checked the noticeboard since I got back
[21674]5206   'Yes, it's on Valentines Day 
[21675]0   
[21676]0   
[21677]11506   'Right,' said Harry, wondering why she was telling him this
[21678]398    Well, I suppose you want to- 
[21679]5137  'Only if you do,' she said eagerly
[21680]5854   Harry stared
[21681]1543    He had been about to say, I suppose you want to know when the next DA meeting is
[21682]701  ' but her response did not seem to fit
[21683]5207   I-er-' he said
[21684]13828   Oh, it's OK if you don't,' she said, looking mortified
[21685]2986    Don't worry
[21686]567    I-I'll see you around
[21687]500   'She walked away
[21688]6166    Harry stood staring after her, his brain working frantically
[21689]184    Then something clunked into place
[21690]150   Cho
[21691]176   Hey-CHO
[21692]210  'He ran after her, catching her halfway up the marble staircase
[21693]6459   Er-d'you want to come into Hogsmeade with me on Valentine's Day
[21694]299  'Oooh, yes
[21695]5136  ' she said, blushing crimson and beaming at him
[21696]557   Right 
[21697]0   
[21698]0   
[21699]0    well 
[21700]0   
[21701]0   
[21702]20225    that's settled then,' said Harry, and feeling that the day was not going to be a complete loss after all, he virtually bounced off to the library to pick up Ron and Hermione before their afternoon lessons
[21703]12302   By six o'clock that evening, however, even the glow of having successfully asked out Cho Chang could not lighten the ominous feelings that intensified with every step Harry took towards Snape's office
[21704]1211   He paused outside the door when he reached it, wishing he were almost anywhere else, then, taking a deep breath, he knocked and entered
[21705]761   The shadowy room was lined with shelves bearing hundreds of glass jars in which slimy bits of animals and plants were suspended in variously coloured potions
[21706]6555    In one corner stood the cupboard full of ingredients that Snape had once accused Harry-not without reason-of robbing
[21707]10923    Harry's attention was drawn towards the desk, however, where a shallow stone basin engraved with runes and symbols lay in a pool of candlelight
[21708]11351    Harry recognised it at once-it was Dumbledore's Pensieve
[21709]6415    Wondering what on earth it was doing there, he jumped when Snape's cold voice came out of the shadows
[21710]1064   Shut the door behind you, Potter
[21711]6944   'Harry did as he was told, with the horrible feeling that he was imprisoning himself
[21712]1882    When he turned back into the room, Snape had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair opposite his desk
[21713]14176    Harry sat down and so did Snape, his cold black eyes fixed unblinkingly upon Harry, dislike etched in every line of his face
[21714]6318   Well, Potter, you know why you are here,' he said
[21715]483    The Headmaster has asked me to teach you Occlumency
[21716]135    I can only hope that you prove more adept at it than at Potions
[21717]11379   'Right,' said Harry tersely
[21718]7718   This may not be an ordinary class, Potter,' said Snape, his eyes narrowed malevolently, but I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me sir or Professor at all times
[21719]292   'Yes 
[21720]0   
[21721]0   
[21722]10961    sir,' said Harry
[21723]6454   Snape continued to survey him through narrowed eyes for a moment, then said, Now, Occlumency
[21724]5751    As I told you back in your dear godfather's kitchen, this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intrusion and influence
[21725]2545   'And why does Professor Dumbledore think I need it, sir
[21726]17751  ' said Harry looking directly into Snape's eyes and wondering whether Snape would answer
[21727]7030   Snape looked back at him for a moment and then said contemptuously, Surely even you could have worked that out by now, Potter
[21728]5187   The Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency -'What's that
[21729]143   Sir
[21730]5164  'It is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another person's mind-'He can read minds
[21731]11024  ' said Harry quickly, his worst fears confirmed
[21732]6843   You have no subtlety, Potter,' said Snape, his dark eyes glittering
[21733]164    You do not understand fine distinctions
[21734]94    It is one of the shortcomings that makes you such a lamentable potion-maker
[21735]6609   'Snape paused for a moment, apparently to savour the pleasure of insulting Harry, before continuing
[21736]374   Only Muggles talk of mind-reading"
[21737]405    The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure
[21738]1045    Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls, to be perused by any invader, the mind is a complex and many-layered thing, Potter- or at least, most minds are
[21739]12   ' He smirked
[21740]254    It is true, however, that those who have mastered Legilimency are able, under certain conditions, to delve into the minds of their victims and to interpret their findings correctly
[21741]607    The Dark Lord, for instance, almost always knows when somebody is lying to him
[21742]358    Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie, and so can utter falsehoods in his presence without detection
[21743]15842   'Whatever Snape said, Legilimency sounded like mind-reading to Harry, and he didn't like the sound of it at all
[21744]1416   So he could know what we're thinking right now
[21745]143   Sir
[21746]6499  'The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them,' said Snape
[21747]1335    Time and space matter in magic, Potter
[21748]187    Eye contact is often essential to Legilimency
[21749]61   'Well then, why do I have to learn Occlumency
[21750]7462  'Snape eyed Harry, tracing his mouth with one long, thin finger as he did so
[21751]578   The usual rules do not seem to apply with you, Potter
[21752]630    The curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and the Dark Lord
[21753]5462    The evidence suggests that at times, when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable -when you are asleep, for instance-you are sharing the Dark Lord's thoughts and emotions
[21754]127    The Headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue
[21755]692    He wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark Lord
[21756]10662   'Harry's heart was pumping fast again
[21757]94    None of this added up
[21758]2125   But why does Professor Dumbledore want to stop it
[21759]379  ' he asked abruptly
[21760]10808    I don't like it much, but it's been useful, hasn't it
[21761]231   I mean 
[21762]0   
[21763]0   
[21764]8027    I saw that snake attack Mr Weasley and if I hadn't, Professor Dumbledore wouldn't have been able to save him, would he
[21765]143   Sir
[21766]6573  'Snape stared at Harry for a few moments, still tracing his mouth with his finger
[21767]282    When he spoke again, it was slowly and deliberately, as though he weighed every word
[21768]434   It appears that the Dark Lord has been unaware of the connection between you and himself until very recently
[21769]57    Up till now it seems that you have been experiencing his emotions, and sharing his thoughts, without his being any the wiser
[21770]556    However, the vision you had shortly before Christmas-'The one with the snake and Mr
[21771]636    Weasley
[21772]6620  'Do not interrupt me, Potter,' said Snape in a dangerous voice
[21773]11249    As I was saying, the vision you had shortly before Christmas represented such a powerful incursion upon the Dark Lord's thoughts-'I saw inside the snake's head, not his
[21774]1986  'I thought I just told you not to interrupt me, Potter
[21775]7531  'But Harry did not care if Snape was angry; at last he seemed to be getting to the bottom of this business; he had moved forwards in his chair so that, without realising it, he was perched on the very edge, tense as though poised for flight
[21776]16258   How come I saw through the snake's eyes if it's Voldemort's thoughts I'm sharing
[21777]5417  'Do not say the Dark Lord's name
[21778]491  ' spat Snape
[21779]113   There was a nasty silence
[21780]54    They glared at each other across the Pensieve
[21781]1654   Professor Dumbledore says his name
[21782]10955   ' said Harry quietly
[21783]1604   Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,' Snape muttered

[21790]6761   ' He rubbed his left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the spot where Harry knew the Dark Mark was burned into his skin
[21791]14314   I just wanted to know,' Harry began again, forcing his voice back to politeness, why-'You seem to have visited the snake's mind because that was where the Dark Lord was at that particular moment,' snarled Snape
[21792]840    He was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it, too
[21793]55   'And Vol-he- realised I was there
[21794]5592  'It seems so,' said Snape coolly
[21795]771   How do you know
[21796]10841  ' said Harry urgently
[21797]2380    Is this just Professor Dumbledore guessing, or- 
[21798]6638  'I told you,' said Snape, rigid in his chair, his eyes slits, to call me sir"
[21799]12069   Yes, sir,' said Harry impatiently, but how do you know-'
[21800]6340  It is enough that we know,' said Snape repressively
[21801]610    The important point is that the Dark Lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his thoughts and feelings
[21802]1112    He has also deduced that the process is likely to work in reverse; that is to say, he has realised that he might be able to access your thoughts and feelings in return-'And he might try and make me do things
[21803]6088  ' asked Harry
[21804]143    Sir
[21805]102  ' he added hurriedly
[21806]5716   He might,' said Snape, sounding cold and unconcerned
[21807]38    Which brings us back to Occlumency
[21808]8620   'Snape pulled out his wand from an inside pocket of his robes and Harry tensed in his chair, but Snape merely raised the wand to his temple and placed its tip into the greasy roots of his hair
[21809]3045    When he withdrew it, some silvery substance came away, stretching from temple to wand like a thick gossamer strand, which broke as he pulled the wand away from it and fell gracefully into the Pensieve, where it swirled silvery-white, neither gas nor liquid
[21810]8586    Twice more, Snape raised the wand to his temple and deposited the silvery substance into the stone basin, then, without offering any explanation of his behaviour, he picked up the Pensieve carefully, removed it to a shelf out of their way and returned to face Harry with his wand held at the ready
[21811]937   Stand up and take out your wand, Potter
[21812]6865   'Harry got to his feet, feeling nervous
[21813]170    They faced each other with the desk between them
[21814]7050   You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me, or defend yourself in any other way you can think of,' said Snape
[21815]489   And what are you going to do
[21816]11752  ' Harry asked, eyeing Snape's wand apprehensively
[21817]5841   I am about to attempt to break into your mind,' said Snape softly
[21818]496    We are going to see how well you resist
[21819]393    I have been told that you have already shown aptitude at resisting the Imperius Curse

[21826]1646    The office swam in front of his eyes and vanished; image after image was racing through his mind like a flickering film so vivid it blinded him to his surroundings

[21845]22495   No, said a voice inside Harry's head, as the memory of Cho drew nearer, you're not watching that, you're not watching it, it's private-He felt a sharp pain in his knee
[21846]11684    Snape's office had come back into view and he realised that he had fallen to the floor; one of his knees had collided painfully with the leg of Snape's desk
[21847]1622    He looked up at Snape, who had lowered his wand and was rubbing his wrist
[21848]820    There was an angry weal there, like a scorch mark
[21849]917   Did you mean to produce a Stinging Hex
[21850]862  ' asked Snape coolly
[21851]11218   No,' said Harry bitterly, getting up from the floor

[21859]6429  ' My Aunt Marge,' Harry muttered, hating Snape
[21860]6076   Well, for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been,' said Snape, raising his wand once more
[21861]798    You managed to stop me eventually, though you wasted time and energy shouting
[21862]31    You must remain focused
[21863]647    Repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand
[21864]11668   'I'm trying,' said Harry angrily, but you're not telling me how
[21865]6040  'Manners, Potter,' said Snape dangerously
[21866]913    Now, I want you to close your eyes
[21867]6781   'Harry threw him a filthy look before doing as he was told
[21868]3227    He did not like the idea of standing there with his eyes shut while Snape faced him, carrying a wand
[21869]11635   Clear your mind, Potter,' said Snape's cold voice

[21969]1586    Weasley on the twelfth of August as they hurried to the courtrooms in the Ministry; it was the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries and Mr
[21970]5931    Weasley had been there the night that he had been attacked by Voldemort's snake

[21985]805   There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, few of which you would understand and none of which concern you

[22007]6403   Harry felt shivery; his scar was still aching, he felt almost feverish

[22048]5336   Well, I don't know,' Hermione admitted
[22049]251    That is a bit odd 
[22050]0   
[22051]0   
[22052]4862   'So what's in the Department of Mysteries
[22053]8090  ' Harry asked Ron
[22054]125    Has your dad ever mentioned anything about it
[22055]8316  'I know they call the people who work in there Unspeakables",' said Ron, frowning
[22056]1291    Because no one really seems to know what they do-weird place to have a weapon
[22057]11541   'It's not weird at all, it makes perfect sense,' said Hermione
[22058]317    It will be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing, I expect 
[22059]0   
[22060]0   
[22061]6516    Harry, are you sure you're all right
[22062]7247  'For Harry had just run both his hands hard over his forehead as though trying to iron it
[22063]277   Yeah 
[22064]0   
[22065]0   
[22066]75    fine 
[22067]0   
[22068]0   
[22069]5309   ' he said, lowering his hands, which were trembling
[22070]1128    I just feel a bit 
[22071]0   
[22072]0   
[22073]3711    I don't like Occlumency much
[22074]7720   'I expect anyone would feel snaky if they'd had their mind attacked over and over again,' said Hermione sympathetically
[22075]6840    Look, let's get back to the common room, we'll be a bit more comfortable there
[22076]1732   'But the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter and excitement; Fred and George were demonstrating their latest bit of joke shop merchandise
[22077]92   Headless Hats
[22078]1516  ' shouted George, as Fred waved a pointed hat decorated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students
[22079]531    Two Galleons each, watch Fred, now
[22080]1106  'Fred swept the hat on to his head, beaming
[22081]1605    For a second he merely looked rather stupid; then both hat and head vanished
[22082]139   Several girls screamed, but everyone else was roaring with laughter
[22083]0   And off again
[22084]7285  ' shouted George, and Fred's hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder; then his head reappeared as he swept the pink-feathered hat from it
[22085]135   How do those hats work, then
[22086]7783  ' said Hermione, distracted from her homework and watching Fred and George closely
[22087]10066    I mean, obviously it's some kind of Invisibility Spell, but it's rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object 
[22088]0   
[22089]0   
[22090]3549    I'd imagine the charm wouldn't have a very long life though
[22091]6658   'Harry did not answer; he was feeling ill
[22092]2337   I'm going to have to do this tomorrow,' he muttered, pushing the books he had just taken out of his bag back inside it
[22093]109   Well, write it in your homework planner then
[22094]6708  ' said Hermione encouragingly
[22095]2965    So you don't forget
[22096]8254  'Harry and Ron exchanged looks as he reached into his bag, withdrew the planner and opened it tentatively
[22097]3427   Don't leave it till later, you big second-rater
[22098]11207  ' chided the book as Harry scribbled down Umbridge's homework
[22099]1634    Hermione beamed at it
[22100]13175   I think I'll go to bed,' said Harry, stuffing the homework planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he got
[22101]1764   He walked across the common room, dodging George, who tried to put a Headless Hat on him, and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boys' dormitories
[22102]3064    He was feeling sick again, just as he had the night he had had the vision of the snake, but thought that if he could just lie down for a while he would be all right
[22103]1920   He opened the door of his dormitory and was one step inside it when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must have sliced into the top of his head
[22104]3108    He did not know where be was, whether he was standing or lying down, he did not even know his own name
[22105]158   Maniacal laughter was ringing in his ears 
[22106]0   
[22107]0   
[22108]919    he was happier than he had been in a very long time 
[22109]0   
[22110]0   
[22111]18    jubilant, ecstatic, triumphant 
[22112]0   
[22113]0   
[22114]382    a wonderful, wonderful thing had happened 
[22115]0   
[22116]0   
[22117]5732   Harry
[22118]5732   HARRY
[22119]617  'Someone had hit him around the face
[22120]139    The insane laughter was punctuated with a cry of pain
[22121]165    The happiness was draining out of him, but the laughter continued 
[22122]0   
[22123]0   
[22124]1705   He opened his eyes and, as he did so, he became aware that the wild laughter was coming out of his own mouth
[22125]7238    The moment he realised this, it died away; Harry lay panting on the floor, staring up at the ceiling, the scar on his forehead throbbing horribly
[22126]2668    Ron was bending over him, looking very worried
[22127]143   What happened
[22128]5086  ' he said
[22129]0   I 
[22130]0   
[22131]0   
[22132]44    dunno 
[22133]0   
[22134]0   
[22135]5897   ' Harry gasped, sitting up again
[22136]5092    He's really happy 
[22137]0   
[22138]0   
[22139]342    really happy 
[22140]0   
[22141]0   
[22142]771   'You-Know-Who is
[22143]10991  'Something good's happened,' mumbled Harry
[22144]676    He was shaking as badly as he had done after seeing the snake attack Mr
[22145]952    Weasley and felt very sick
[22146]4774    Something he's been hoping for
[22147]12842   'The words came, just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing room, as though a stranger was speaking them through Harry's mouth, yet he knew they were true
[22148]2310    He took deep breaths, willing himself not to vomit all over Ron
[22149]810    He was very glad that Dean and Seamus were not here to watch this time
[22150]16117   Hermione told me to come and check on you,' said Ron in a low voice, helping Harry to his feet
[22151]5824    She says your defences will be low at the moment, after Snape's been fiddling around with your mind 
[22152]0   
[22153]0   
[22154]3642    still, I suppose it'll help in the long run, won't it
[22155]6606  ' He looked doubtfully at Harry as he helped him towards his bed
[22156]6430    Harry nodded without any conviction and slumped back on his pillows, aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening, his scar still prickling painfully
[22157]6579    He could not help feeling that his first foray into Occlumency had weakened his mind's resistance rather than strengthening it, and he wondered, with a feeling of great trepidation, what had happened to make Lord Voldemort the happiest he had been in fourteen years

[22183]10651     Harry's question was answered the very next morning
[22184]7166    When Hermione's Daily Prophet arrived she smoothed it out, gazed for a moment at the front page and gave a yelp that caused everyone in the vicinity to stare at her
[22185]0   What
[22186]12820  ' said Harry and Ron together
[22187]5835   For answer she spread the newspaper on the table in front of them and pointed at ten black-and-white photographs that filled the whole of the front page, nine showing wizards' faces and the tenth, a witch's
[22188]1059    Some of the people in the photographs were silently jeering; others were tapping their fingers on the frame of their pictures, looking insolent
[22189]262    Each picture was captioned with a name and the crime for which the person had been sent to Azkaban
[22190]7052   Antonin Dolohov, read the legend beneath a wizard with a long, pale, twisted face who was sneering up at Harry, convicted of the brutal murders of Gideon and Fabian Prewett
[22191]6716   Algernon Rookwood, said the caption beneath a pockmarked man with greasy hair who was leaning against the edge of his picture, looking bored, convicted of leaking Ministry of Magic secrets to He Who Must Not Be Named
[22192]11104   But Harry's eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch
[22193]1063    Her face had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page
[22194]1777    She had long, dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture, though he had seen it sleek, thick and shining
[22195]889    She glared up at him through heavily lidded eyes, an arrogant, disdainful smile playing around her thin mouth
[22196]2206    Like Sirius, she retained vestiges of great good looks, but something-perhaps Azkaban-had taken most of her beauty
[22197]132   Bellatrix Lestrange, convicted of the torture and permanent incapacitation of Frank and Alice Longbottom
[22198]13385   Hermione nudged Harry and pointed at the headline over the pictures, which Harry, concentrating on Bellatrix, had not yet read
[22199]719   MASS BREAKOUT FROM AZKABANMINISTRY FEARS BLACK IS RALLYING POINT'FOR OLD DEATH EATERSBlack
[22200]10954  ' said Harry loudly
[22201]0    Not-
[22202]2  'Shhh
[22203]1771  ' whispered Hermione desperately
[22204]1024    Not so loud-just read it
[22205]750  'The Ministry of Magic announced late last night that there has been a mass breakout from Azkaban
[22206]1320   Speaking to reporters in his private office, Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic, confirmed that ten high-security prisoners escaped in the early hours of yesterday evening and that he has already informed the Muggle Prime Minister of the dangerous nature of these individuals
[22207]6859   We find ourselves, most unfortunately, in the same position we were two and a half years ago when the murderer Sirius Black escaped,'said Fudge last night
[22208]565   'Nor do we think the two breakouts are unrelated
[22209]1078    An escape of this magnitude suggests outside help, and we must remember that Black, as the first person ever to break out of Azkaban, would be ideally placed to help others follow in his footsteps
[22210]5915    We think it likely that these individuals, who include Black's cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, have rallied around Black as their leader
[22211]466    We are, however, doing all we can to round up the criminals, and we beg the magical community to remain alert and cautious
[22212]38    On no account should any of these individuals be approached
[22213]13432   'There you are, Harry,' said Ron, looking awestruck
[22214]4994    That's why he was happy last night
[22215]9667   'I don't believe this,' snarled Harry, Fudge is blaming the breakout on Sirius
[22216]90  'What other options does he have
[22217]6718  ' said Hermione bitterly
[22218]8915    He can hardly say, Sorry, everyone, Dumbledore warned me this might happen, the Azkaban guards have joined Lord Voldemort"-stop whimpering,Ron-"and now Voldemort's worst supporters have broken out, too
[22219]8688    I mean, he's spent a good six months telling everyone you and Dumbledore are liars, hasn't he
[22220]9242  'Hermione ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report inside while Harry looked around the Great Hall
[22221]3829    He could not understand why his fellow students were not looking scared or at least discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page, but very few of them took the newspaper every day like Hermione
[22222]6108    There they all were, talking about homework and Quidditch and who knew what other rubbish, when outside these walls ten more Death Eaters had swollen Voldemort's ranks
[22223]304   He glanced up at the staff table
[22224]2677    It was a different story there: Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall were deep in conversation, both looking extremely grave
[22225]1104    Professor Sprout had the Prophet propped against a bottle of ketchup and was reading the front page with such concentration that she was not noticing the gentle drip of egg yolk falling into her lap from her stationary spoon
[22226]1920    Meanwhile, at the far end of the table, Professor Umbridge was tucking into a bowl of porridge
[22227]6492    For once her pouchy toad's eyes were not sweeping the Great Hall looking for misbehaving students
[22228]1560    She scowled as she gulped down her food and every now and then she shot a malevolent glance up the table to where Dumbledore and McGonagall were talking so intently
[22229]7265   Oh my-' said Hermione wonderingly, still staring at the newspaper
[22230]0   What now
[22231]11144  ' said Harry quickly; he was feeling jumpy
[22232]4750   It's 
[22233]0   
[22234]0   
[22235]7367    horrible,' said Hermione, looking shaken
[22236]7853    She folded back page ten of the newspaper and handed it to Harry and Ron
[22237]440   TRAGIC DEMISE OF MINISTRY OF MAGIC WORKERSt
[22238]5820    Mungo's Hospital promised a full inquiry last night after Ministry of Magic worker Broderich Bode, 49, was discovered dead in his bed, strangled by a pot plant
[22239]558    Healers called to the scene were unable to revive Mr
[22240]261    Bode, who had been injured in a workplace accident some weeks prior to his death
[22241]412   Healer Miriam Strout, who was in charge of Mr
[22242]10605    Bode's ward at the time of the incident, has been suspended on full pay and was unavailable for comment yesterday, but a spokeswizard for the hospital said in a statement:St
[22243]5355    Mungo's deeply regrets the death of Mr
[22244]71    Bode, whose health was improving steadily prior to this tragic accident
[22245]550   We have strict guidelines on the decorations permitted on our wards but it appears that Healer Strout, busy over the Christmas period, overlooked the dangers of the plant on Mr
[22246]4997    Bode's bedside table
[22247]428    As his speech and mobility improved, Healer Strout encouraged Mr
[22248]5692    Bode to look after the plant himself, unaware that it was not an innocent Flitterbloom, but a cutting of Devil's Snare which, when touched by the convalescent Mr
[22249]35    Bode, throttled him instantly
[22250]40   St
[22251]5659    Mungo's is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come forward
[22252]24   'Bode 
[22253]0   
[22254]0   
[22255]7088   ' said Ron
[22256]24    Bode
[22257]63   It rings a bell 
[22258]0   
[22259]0   
[22260]2064   'We saw him,' Hermione whispered
[22261]40    In St
[22262]4890    Mungo's, remember
[22263]6322   He was in the bed opposite Lockhart's, just lying there, staring at the ceiling
[22264]5098    And we saw the Devil's Snare arrive
[22265]5208    She-the Healer-said it was a Christmas present
[22266]6471   'Harry looked back at the story
[22267]996    A feeling of horror was rising like bile in his throat
[22268]7916   How come we didn't recognise Devil's Snare
[22269]876   We've seen it before 
[22270]0   
[22271]0   
[22272]847    we could've stopped this from happening
[22273]4924   'Who expects Devil's Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a pot plant
[22274]7143  ' said Ron sharply
[22275]4885    It's not our fault, whoever sent it to the bloke is to blame
[22276]2811   They must be a real prat, why didn't they check what they were buying
[22277]2800  'Oh, come on, Ron
[22278]6709  ' said Hermione shakily
[22279]8390    I don't think anyone could put Devil's Snare in a pot and not realise it tries to kill whoever touches it
[22280]9   This-this was murder 
[22281]0   
[22282]0   
[22283]29    a clever murder, as well 
[22284]0   
[22285]0   
[22286]6001    if the plant was sent anonymously, how's anyone ever going to find out who did it
[22287]10584  'Harry was not thinking about Devil's Snare
[22288]1552    He was remembering taking the lift down to the ninth level of the Ministry on the day of his hearing and the sallow-faced man who had got in on the Atrium level
[22289]5300   I met Bode,' he said slowly
[22290]656    I saw him at the Ministry with your dad
[22291]7323   ' Ron's mouth fell open
[22292]1272   I've heard Dad talk about him at home
[22293]141   He was an Unspeakable-he worked in the Department of Mysteries
[22294]3735  'They looked at each other for a moment, then Hermione pulled the newspaper back towards her, closed it, glared for a moment at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters on the front, then leapt to her feet
[22295]489   Where are you going
[22296]7097  ' said Ron, startled
[22297]7018   To send a letter,' said Hermione, swinging her bag on to her shoulder
[22298]0    It 
[22299]0   
[22300]0   
[22301]3712    well, I don't know whether 
[22302]0   
[22303]0   
[22304]5009    but it's worth trying 
[22305]0   
[22306]0   
[22307]441    and I'm the only one who can
[22308]9548   'I hate it when she does that,' grumbled Ron, as he and Harry got up from the table and made their own, slower way out of the Great Hall
[22309]5166    Would it kill her to tell us what she's up to for once
[22310]1371   It'd take her about ten more seconds-hey, Hagrid
[22311]1381  'Hagrid was standing beside the doors into the Entrance Hall, waiting for a crowd of Ravenclaws to pass
[22312]1540    He was still as heavily bruised as he had been on the day he had come back from his mission to the giants and there was a new cut right across the bridge of his nose
[22313]25   All righ', you two
[22314]5523  ' he said, trying to muster a smile but managing only a kind of pained grimace
[22315]734   Are you OK, Hagrid
[22316]6139  ' asked Harry, following him as he lumbered after the Ravenclaws
[22317]7747   Fine, fine,' said Hagrid with a feeble assumption of airiness; he waved a hand and narrowly missed concussing a frightened-looking Professor Vector, who was passing
[22318]2675    Jus' busy, yeh know, usual stuff-lessons ter prepare- couple o' salamanders got scale rot-an' I'm on probation,' he mumbled
[22319]10   You're on probation
[22320]8092  ' said Ron very loudly, so that many of the passing students looked around curiously
[22321]336    Sorry-I mean-you're on probation
[22322]123  ' he whispered
[22323]6015   Yeah,' said Hagrid
[22324]5348    ' S'no more'n I expected, ter tell yer the truth
[22325]2177    Yeh migh' not've picked up on it, bu' that inspection didn' go too well, yeh know 
[22326]0   
[22327]0   
[22328]60    anyway,' he sighed deeply
[22329]843    Bes' go an' rub a bit more chilli powder on them salamanders or their tails'll be hangin' off em next
[22330]5862    See yeh, Harry 
[22331]0   
[22332]0   
[22333]2002    Ron 
[22334]0   
[22335]0   
[22336]701   'He trudged away, out of the front doors and down the stone steps into the damp grounds
[22337]6072    Harry watched him go, wondering how much more bad news he could stand
[22338]12666   The fact that Hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge within the school over the next few days, but to Harry's indignation, hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it; indeed, some people, Draco Malfoy prominent among them, seemed positively gleeful
[22339]325    As for the freakish death of an obscure Department of Mysteries employee in St
[22340]14736    Mungo's, Harry, Ron and Hermione seemed to be the only people who knew or cared
[22341]1149    There was only one topic of conversation in the corridors now: the ten escaped Death Eaters, whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few people who read the newspapers
[22342]2729    Rumours were flying that some of the convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade, that they were supposed to be hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to break into Hogwarts, just as Sirius Black had once done
[22343]5772   Those who came from wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear as Voldemorts; the crimes they had committed during the days of Voldemort's reign of terror were legendary
[22344]13577    There were relatives of their victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, whose uncle, aunt and cousins had all died at the hands of one of the ten, said miserably during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be Harry
[22345]13894   And I don't know how you stand it-it's horrible,' she said bluntly, dumping far too much dragon manure on her tray of Screechsnap seedlings, causing them to wriggle and squeak in discomfort
[22346]6601   It was true that Harry was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors these days, yet he thought he detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperers' voices
[22347]5636    They sounded curious rather than hostile now, and once or twice he was sure he overheard snatches of conversation that, suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the Prophet's version of how and why ten Death Eaters had managed to break out of the Azkaban fortress
[22348]6890    In their confusion and fear, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them: the one that Harry and Dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year
[22349]206   It was not only the students' mood that had changed
[22350]1710    It was now quite common to come across two or three teachers conversing in low, urgent whispers in the corridors, breaking off their conversations the moment they saw students approaching
[22351]18852   They obviously can't talk freely in the staff room any more,' said Hermione in a low voice, as she, Harry and Ron passed Professors McGonagall, Flitwick and Sprout huddled together outside the Charms classroom one day
[22352]571    Not with Umbridge there
[22353]962   'Reckon they know anything new
[22354]7315  ' said Ron, gazing back over his shoulder at the three teachers
[22355]678   If they do, we're not going to hear about it, are we
[22356]10901  ' said Harry angrily
[22357]26    Not after Decree 
[22358]0   
[22359]0   
[22360]72    what number are we on now
[22361]1550  ' For new notices had appeared on the house noticeboards the morning after news of the Azkaban breakout:BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS Teachers are hereby banned from giving students any informationthat is not strictly related to the subjects they are paid to teach
[22362]22    The above is in accordance with Educational DecreeNumber Twenty-six
[22363]1313    Signed: Dolores Jane Umbridge, High InquisitorThis latest Decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes among the students
[22364]2257    Lee Jordan had pointed out to Umbridge that by the terms of the new rule she was not allowed to tell Fred and George off for playing Exploding Snap in the back of the class
[22365]6663   Exploding Snap's got nothing to do with Defence Against the Dark Arts, Professor
[22366]4835   That's not information relating to your subject
[22367]6505  'When Harry next saw Lee, the back of his hand was bleeding rather badly
[22368]5748    Harry recommended essence of Murtlap
[22369]7934   Harry had thought the breakout from Azkaban might have humbled Umbridge a little, that she might have been abashed at the catastrophe that had occurred right under the nose of her beloved Fudge
[22370]432    It seemed, however, to have only intensified her furious desire to bring every aspect of life at Hogwarts under her personal control
[22371]2129    She seemed determined at the very least to achieve a sacking before long, and the only question was whether it would be Professor Trelawney or Hagrid who went first
[22372]983   Every single Divination and Care of Magical Creatures lesson was now conducted in the presence of Umbridge and her clipboard
[22373]6811    She lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room, interrupting Professor Trelawney's increasingly hysterical talks with difficult questions about ornithomancy and heptomology, insisting that she predicted students' answers before they gave them and demanding that she demonstrate her skill at the crystal ball, the tea leaves and the rune stones in turn
[22374]7067    Harry thought Professor Trelawney might soon crack under the strain
[22375]1321    Several times he passed her in the corridors-in itself a very unusual occurrence as she generally remained in her tower room-muttering wildly to herself, wringing her hands and shooting terrified glances over her shoulder, and all the while giving off a powerful smell of cooking sherry
[22376]6900    If he had not been so worried about Hagrid, he would have felt sorry for her-but if one of them was to be ousted from their job, there could be only one choice for Harry as to who should remain
[22377]6707   Unfortunately, Harry could not see that Hagrid was putting up a better show than Trelawney
[22378]6637    Though he seemed to be following Hermione's advice and had shown them nothing more frightening than a Crup-a creature indistinguishable from a Jack Russell terrier except for its forked tail-since before Christmas, he too seemed to have lost his nerve
[22379]1610    He was oddly distracted and jumpy during lessons, losing the thread of what he was saying to the class, answering questions wrongly, and all the time glancing anxiously at Umbridge
[22380]9742    He was also more distant with Harry, Ron and Hermione than he had ever been before, and had expressly forbidden them to visit him after dark
[22381]1200   If she catches yeh, it'll be all of our necks on the line,' he told them flatly, and with no desire to do anything that might jeopardise his job further they abstained from walking down to his hut in the evenings
[22382]13153   It seemed to Harry that Umbridge was steadily depriving him of everything that made his life at Hogwarts worth living: visits to Hagrid's house, letters from Sirius, his Firebolt and Quidditch
[22383]610    He took his revenge the only way he could-by redoubling his efforts for the DA
[22384]6608   Harry was pleased to see that all of them, even Zacharias Smith, had been spurred on to work harder than ever by the news that ten more Death Eaters were now on the loose, but in nobody was this improvement more pronounced than in Neville
[22385]377    The news of his parents' attackers' escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in him
[22386]9602    He had not once mentioned his meeting with Harry, Ron and Hermione on the closed ward in St
[22387]5087    Mungo's and, taking their lead from him, they had kept quiet about it too
[22388]5245    Nor had he said anything on the subject of Bellatrix and her fellow torturers' escape
[22389]7736    In fact, Neville barely spoke during the DA meetings any more, but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and counter-curse Harry taught them, his plump face screwed up in concentration, apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents and working harder than anyone else in the room
[22390]8143    He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught them, the Shield Charm-a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that they rebounded upon the attacker-only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville
[22391]6743   Harry would have given a great deal to be making as much progress at Occlumency as Neville was making during the DA meetings
[22392]11122    Harry's sessions with Snape, which had started badly enough, were not improving
[22393]6258    On the contrary, Harry felt he was getting worse with every lesson
[22394]5616   Before he had started studying Occlumency, his scar had prickled occasionally, usually during the night, or else following one of those strange flashes of Voldemort's thoughts or mood that he experienced every now and then
[22395]1306    Nowadays, however, his scar hardly ever stopped prickling, and he often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what was happening to him at the time, which were always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar
[22396]6353    He had the horrible impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in Voldemort's mood, and he was sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first Occlumency lesson with Snape
[22397]1502    What was more, he was now dreaming about walking down the corridor towards the entrance to the Department of Mysteries almost every night, dreams which always culminated in him standing longingly in front of the plain black door
[22398]20808   Maybe it's a bit like an illness,' said Hermione, looking concerned when Harry confided in her and Ron
[22399]2    A fever or something
[22400]260    It has to get worse before it gets better
[22401]13159   'The lessons with Snape are making it worse,' said Harry flatly I'm getting sick of my scar hurting and I'm getting bored with walking down that corridor every night
[22402]133   ' He rubbed his forehead angrily
[22403]13962    I just wish the door would open, I'm sick of standing staring at it-'That's not funny,' said Hermione sharply
[22404]7052    Dumbledore doesn't want you to have dreams about that corridor at all, or he wouldn't have asked Snape to teach you Occlumency
[22405]1679    You're just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons
[22406]34   'I am working
[22407]10820  ' said Harry, nettled
[22408]7568    You try it some time-Snape: trying to get inside your head-it's not a bundle of laughs, you know
[22409]73  'Maybe 
[22410]0   
[22411]0   
[22412]7214   ' said Ron slowly
[22413]73   Maybe what
[22414]6703  ' said Hermione, rather snappishly
[22415]25001   Maybe it's not Harry's fault he can't close his mind,' said Ron darkly
[22416]231   What do you mean
[22417]6701  ' said Hermione
[22418]9360   Well, maybe Snape isn't really trying to help Harry 
[22419]0   
[22420]0   
[22421]7469   'Harry and Hermione stared at him
[22422]2704    Ron looked darkly and meaningfully from one to the other
[22423]21835   Maybe,' he said again, in a lower voice, he's actually trying to open Harry's mind a bit wider 
[22424]0   
[22425]0   
[22426]9882    make it easier for You-Know-Shut up, Ron,' said Hermione angrily
[22427]1116    How many times have you suspected Snape, and when have you ever been right
[22428]1047   Dumbledore trusts him, he works for the Order, that ought to be enough
[22429]7375   'He used to be a Death Eater,' said Ron stubbornly
[22430]1195    And we've never seen proof that he really swapped sides
[22431]2488   'Dumbledore trusts him,' Hermione repeated
[22432]5463    And if we can't trust Dumbledore, we can't trust anyone
[22433]1362   'With so much to worry about and so much to do- startling amounts of homework that frequently kept the fifth-years working until past midnight, secret DA sessions and regular classes with Snape- January seemed to be passing alarmingly fast
[22434]6516    Before Harry knew it, February had arrived, bringing with it wetter and warmer weather and the prospect of the second Hogsmeade visit of the year
[22435]11927    Harry had had very little time to spare for conversations with Cho since they had agreed to visit the village together, but suddenly found himself facing a Valentine's Day spent entirely in her company
[22436]216   On the morning of the fourteenth he dressed particularly carefully
[22437]11432    He and Ron arrived at breakfast just in time for the arrival of the post owls, Hedwig was not there- not that Harry had expected her-but Hermione was tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown owl as they sat down
[22438]556   And about time
[22439]2908   If it hadn't come today 
[22440]0   
[22441]0   
[22442]5797   ' she said, eagerly tearing open the envelope and pulling out a small piece of parchment
[22443]2193    Her eyes sped from left to right as she read through the message and a grimly pleased expression spread across her face
[22444]11836   Listen, Harry,' she said, looking up at him, this is really important
[22445]638    Do you think you could meet me in the Three Broomsticks around midday
[22446]0  'Well 
[22447]0   
[22448]0   
[22449]10879    I dunno,' said Harry uncertainly
[22450]348    Cho might be expecting me to spend the whole day with her
[22451]5575    We never said what we were going to do
[22452]6757   'Well, bring her along if you must,' said Hermione urgently
[22453]436    But will you come
[22454]0  'Well 
[22455]0   
[22456]0   
[22457]557    all right, but why
[22458]5627  'I haven't got time to tell you now, I've got to answer this quickly
[22459]1045   'And she hurried out of the Great Hall, the letter clutched in one hand and a piece of toast in the other
[22460]106   Are you coming
[22461]9254  ' Harry asked Ron, but he shook his head, looking glum
[22462]7830   I can't come into Hogsmeade at all; Angelina wants a full day's training
[22463]7122    Like it's going to help; we're the worst team I've ever seen
[22464]70    You should see Sloper and Kirke, they're pathetic, even worse than I am
[22465]285   ' He heaved a great sigh
[22466]3708    I dunno why Angelina won't just let me resign
[22467]20712   'It's because you're good when you're on form, that's why,' said Harry irritably
[22468]7129   He found it very hard to be sympathetic to Ron's plight, when he himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against Hufflepuff
[22469]18987    Ron seemed to have noticed Harry's tone, because he did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast, and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said goodbye to each other shortly afterwards
[22470]9666    Ron departed for the Quidditch pitch and Harry, after attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his reflection in the back of a teaspoon, proceeded alone to the Entrance Hall to meet Cho, feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were going to talk about
[22471]1683   She was waiting for him a little to the side of the oak front doors, looking very pretty with her hair tied back in a long pony-tail
[22472]11805    Harry's feet seemed to be too big for his body as he walked towards her and he was suddenly horribly aware of his arms and how stupid they must look swinging at his sides
[22473]5443   Hi,' said Cho slightly breathlessly
[22474]10844   Hi,' said Harry
[22475]11326   They stared at each other for a moment, then Harry said, Well-er-shall we go, then
[22476]654  'Oh-yes 
[22477]0   
[22478]0   
[22479]5620   'They joined the queue of people being signed out by Filch, occasionally catching each other's eye and grinning shiftily, but not talking to each other
[22480]7726    Harry was relieved when they reached the fresh air, finding it easier to walk along in silence than just stand about looking awkward
[22481]8977    It was a fresh, breezy sort of a day and as they passed the Quidditch stadium Harry glimpsed Ron and Ginny skimming along over the stands and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them
[22482]3294   You really miss it, don't you
[22483]5236  ' said Cho
[22484]1269   He looked round and saw her watching him
[22485]6041   Yeah,' sighed Harry
[22486]0    I do
[22487]849   'Remember the first time we played against each other, in the third year
[22488]356  ' she asked him
[22489]11138   Yeah,' said Harry, grinning
[22490]119    You kept blocking me
[22491]5760   'And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to,' said Cho, smiling reminiscently
[22492]1608    I heard he got taken on by Pride of Portree, is that right
[22493]610  'Nah, it was Puddlemere United; I saw him at the World Cup last year
[22494]793   'Oh, I saw you there, too, remember
[22495]1   We were on the same campsite
[22496]3080    It was really good, wasn't it
[22497]714  'The subject of the Quidditch World Cup carried them all the way down the drive and out through the gates
[22498]11503    Harry could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to her-no more difficult, in fact, than talking to Ron and Hermione-and he was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed them, including Pansy Parkinson
[22499]476   Potter and Chang
[22500]47  ' screeched Pansy, to a chorus of snide giggles
[22501]3531    Urgh, Chang, I don't think much of your taste 
[22502]0   
[22503]0   
[22504]961    at least Diggory was good-looking
[22505]6387  ' The girls sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho, leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake
[22506]7420    Harry could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch, and Cho, slightly flushed, was watching her feet
[22507]0   So 
[22508]0   
[22509]0   
[22510]956    where d'you want to go
[22511]6192  ' Harry asked as they entered Hogsmeade
[22512]435    The High Street was full of students ambling up and down, peering into the shop windows and messing about together on the pavements
[22513]362   Oh 
[22514]0   
[22515]0   
[22516]8343    I don't mind,' said Cho, shrugging
[22517]9    Um 
[22518]0   
[22519]0   
[22520]1268    shall we just have a look in the shops or something
[22521]10  'They wandered towards Dervish and Banges
[22522]1034    A large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at it
[22523]12230    They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry found himself staring once more at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters
[22524]947    The poster, By Order of the Ministry of Magic', offered a thousand-Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with information leading to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured
[22525]15134   It's funny, isn't it,' said Cho in a low voice, gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters, remember when that Sirius Black escaped, and there were dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him
[22526]347   And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there are no dementors anywhere 
[22527]0   
[22528]0   
[22529]17453   'Yeah,' said Harry, tearing his eyes away from Bellatrix Lestrange's face to glance up and down the High Street
[22530]292    Yeah, that is weird
[22531]3483   'He wasn't sorry that there were no dementors nearby, but now he came to think of it, their absence was highly significant
[22532]3421    They had not only let the Death Eaters escape, they weren't bothering to look for them 
[22533]0   
[22534]0   
[22535]1345    it looked as though they really were outside Ministry control now
[22536]914   The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window he and Cho passed
[22537]16422    It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshaft's; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry's face and the back of his neck
[22538]9   Um 
[22539]0   
[22540]0   
[22541]963    d'you want to get a coffee
[22542]5478  ' said Cho tentatively, as the rain began to fall more heavily
[22543]12257   Yeah, all right,' said Harry, looking around
[22544]0    Where
[22545]13736  'Oh, there's a really nice place just up here; haven't you ever been to Madam Puddifoot's
[22546]11133  ' she said brightly, leading him up a side road and into a small teashop that Harry had never noticed before
[22547]493    It was a cramped, steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frills or bows
[22548]11249    Harry was reminded unpleasantly of Umbridge's office
[22549]2411   Cute, isn't it
[22550]5276  ' said Cho happily
[22551]121   Er 
[22552]0   
[22553]0   
[22554]11096    yeah,' said Harry untruthfully
[22555]10136   Look, she's decorated it for Valentine's Day
[22556]5707  ' said Cho, indicating a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small, circular tables, occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants
[22557]1   Aaah 
[22558]0   
[22559]0   
[22560]520   'They sat down at the last remaining table, which was over by the steamy window
[22561]1029    Roger Davies, the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl
[22562]264    They were holding hands
[22563]7210    The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable, particularly when, looking around the teashop, he saw that it was full of nothing but couples, all of them holding hands
[22564]613    Perhaps Cho would expect him to hold her hand
[22565]442   What can I get you, m'dears
[22566]10768  ' said Madam Puddifoot, a very stout woman with a shiny black bun, squeezing between their table and Roger Davies's with great difficulty
[22567]5238   Two coffees, please,' said Cho
[22568]967   In the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies and his girlfriend had started kissing over their sugar bowl
[22569]8792    Harry wished they wouldn't; he felt that Davies was setting a standard with which Cho would soon expect him to compete
[22570]3956    He felt his face growing hot and tried staring out of the window, but it was so steamed up he couldn't see the street outside
[22571]1667    To postpone the moment when he would have to look at Cho, he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub
[22572]864   After a few more painful minutes, Cho mentioned Umbridge
[22573]7229    Harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing her, but the subject had already been so thoroughly canvassed during DA meetings it did not last very long
[22574]226    Silence fell again
[22575]6895    Harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from the table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say
[22576]121   Er 
[22577]0   
[22578]0   
[22579]1493    listen, d'you want to come with me to the Three Broomsticks at lunchtime
[22580]2173   I'm meeting Hermione Granger there
[22581]317   'Cho raised her eyebrows
[22582]1732   You're meeting Hermione Granger
[22583]64   Today
[22584]277  'Yeah
[22585]744    Well, she asked me to, so I thought I would
[22586]1392    D'you want to come with me
[22587]8260   She said it wouldn't matter if you did
[22588]362   'Oh 
[22589]0   
[22590]0   
[22591]0    well 
[22592]0   
[22593]0   
[22594]56    that was nice of her
[22595]1362   'But Cho did not sound as though she thought it was nice at all
[22596]851    On the contrary, her tone was cold and all of a sudden she looked rather forbidding
[22597]6461   A few more minutes passed in total silence, Harry drinking his coffee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup
[22598]50    Beside them, Roger Davies and his girlfriend seemed glued together at the tips
[22599]11520   Cho's hand was lying on the table beside her coffee and Harry was feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it
[22600]2293    Just do it, he told himself, as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his chest, just reach out and grab it
[22601]671    Amazing, how much more difficult it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than it was to snatch a speeding Snitch from midair 
[22602]0   
[22603]0   
[22604]1876   But just as he moved his hand forwards, Cho took hers off the table
[22605]289    She was now watching Roger Davies kissing his girlfriend with a mildly interested expression
[22606]6793   He asked me out, you know,' she said in a quiet voice
[22607]172    A couple of weeks ago
[22608]11    Roger
[22609]332    I turned him down, though
[22610]6732   'Harry, who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table, could not think why she was telling him this
[22611]851    If she wished she were sitting at the next table being heartily kissed by Roger Davies, why had she agreed to come: out with him
[22612]5086  He said nothing
[22613]5993    Their cherub threw another handful of confetti over them; some of it landed in the last cold dregs of coffee Harry had been about to drink
[22614]5678   I came in here with Cedric last year,' said Cho
[22615]15963   In the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said, Harry's insides had become glacial
[22616]542    He could not believe she wanted to talk about Cedric now, while kissing couples surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads
[22617]5526   Cho's voice was rather higher when she spoke again
[22618]835   I've been meaning to ask you for ages 
[22619]0   
[22620]0   
[22621]2352    did Cedric-did he-m-m-mention me at all before he died
[22622]6148  'This was the very last subject on earth Harry wanted to discuss, and least of all with Cho
[22623]5223   Well-no-' he said quietly
[22624]3275    There-there wasn't time for him to say anything
[22625]13    Erm 
[22626]0   
[22627]0   
[22628]0    so 
[22629]0   
[22630]0   
[22631]621    d'you 
[22632]0   
[22633]0   
[22634]894    d'you get to see a lot of Quidditch in the holidays
[22635]585   You support the Tornados, right
[22636]654  'His voice sounded falsely bright and cheery
[22637]1859    To his horror, he saw that her eyes were swimming with tears again, just as they had been after the last DA meeting before Christmas
[22638]11393   Look,' he said desperately, leaning in so that nobody else could overhear, let's not talk about Cedric right now 
[22639]0   
[22640]0   
[22641]5190    let's talk about something else 
[22642]0   
[22643]0   
[22644]780   ' But this, apparently, was quite the wrong thing to say
[22645]6835   I thought,' she said, tears spattering down on to the table, I thought you'd u- u-understand
[22646]303   I need to talk about it
[22647]2657   Surely you n-need to talk about it t-too
[22648]3933   I mean, you saw it happen, d-didn't you
[22649]6110  'Everything was going nightmarishly wrong; Roger Davies's girlfriend had even unglued herself to look round at Cho crying
[22650]17198   Well-I have talked about it,' Harry said in a whisper, to Ron and Hermione, but-'Oh, you'll talk to Hermione Granger
[22651]5693  ' she said shrilly, her face now shining with tears
[22652]111    Several more kissing couples broke apart to stare
[22653]2564    But you won't talk to me
[22654]920   P -perhaps it would be best if we just 
[22655]0   
[22656]0   
[22657]3887    just p-paid and you went and met up with Hermione G-Granger, like you obviously want to
[22658]6499  ' Harry stared at her, utterly bewildered, as she seized a frilly napkin and dabbed at her shining face with it
[22659]150   Cho
[22660]5534  ' he said weakly, wishing Roger would seize his girlfriend and start kissing her again to stop her goggling at him and Cho
[22661]122   Go on, leave
[22662]5114  ' she said, now crying into the napkin
[22663]5592    I don't know why you asked me out in the first place if you're going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me 
[22664]0   
[22665]0   
[22666]1683    how many are you meeting after Hermione
[22667]5484  'It's not like that
[22668]11275  ' said Harry, and he was so relieved at finally understanding what she was annoyed about that he laughed, which he realised a split second too late was also a mistake
[22669]409   Cho sprang to her feet
[22670]230    The whole tearoom was quiet and everybody was watching them now
[22671]12468   I'll see you around, Harry,' she said dramatically, and hiccoughing slightly she dashed to the door, wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain
[22672]150   Cho
[22673]6496  ' Harry called after her, but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful tinkle
[22674]93   There was total silence within the teashop
[22675]5886    Every eye was on Harry
[22676]1336    He threw a Galleon down on to the table, shook pink confetti out of his hair, and followed Cho out of the door
[22677]1819   It was raining hard now and she was nowhere to be seen, he simply did not understand what had happened; half an hour ago they had been getting along fine
[22678]3   Women
[22679]463  ' he muttered angrily, sloshing down the rain-washed street with his hands in his pockets
[22680]1164    What did she want to talk about Cedric for, anyway
[22681]1300   Why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe
[22682]1253  'He turned right and broke into a splashy run, and within minutes he was turning into the doorway of the Three Broomsticks
[22683]2968    He knew he was too early to meet Hermione, but he thought it likely there would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening time
[22684]1401    He shook his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around
[22685]1479    Hagrid was sitting alone in a corner, looking morose
[22686]678   Hi, Hagrid
[22687]5428  ' he said, when he had squeezed through the crammed tables and pulled up a chair beside him
[22688]7195   Hagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though he barely recognised him
[22689]6759    Harry saw that he had two fresh cuts on his face and several new bruises
[22690]16712   Oh, it's yeh, Harry,' said Hagrid
[22691]155    Yeh all righ
[22692]11090  'Yeah, I'm fine,' lied Harry; but, next to this battered and mournful-looking Hagrid, he felt he didn't really have much to complain about
[22693]203    Er-are you OK
[22694]0  'Me
[22695]5738  ' said Hagrid
[22696]6816    Oh yeah, I'm grand, Harry, grand
[22697]324   'He gazed into the depths of his pewter tankard, which was the size of a large bucket, and sighed
[22698]9481    Harry didn't know what to say to him
[22699]480    They sat side by side in silence for a moment
[22700]5953    Then Hagrid said abruptly, In the same boat, yeh an' me, aren' we, Arry
[22701]10939  'Er-' said Harry
[22702]277   Yeah 
[22703]0   
[22704]0   
[22705]5779    I've said it before 
[22706]0   
[22707]0   
[22708]6499    both outsiders, like,' said Hagrid, nodding wisely
[22709]3    An' both orphans
[22710]277    Yeah 
[22711]0   
[22712]0   
[22713]3    both orphans
[22714]478   'He took a great swig from his tankard
[22715]5212   Makes a diff'rence, havin' a decent family,' he said
[22716]128    Me dad was decent
[22717]207    An' your mum an' dad were decent
[22718]789    If they'd lived, life woulda bin diff'rent, eh
[22719]277  'Yeah 
[22720]0   
[22721]0   
[22722]15591    I s'pose,' said Harry cautiously
[22723]712    Hagrid seemed to be in a very strange mood
[22724]5825   Family,' said Hagrid gloomily
[22725]5298    Whatever yeh say, blood's important 
[22726]0   
[22727]0   
[22728]170   ' And he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye
[22729]11761   Hagrid,' said Harry, unable to stop himself, where are you getting all these injuries
[22730]28  'Eh
[22731]6352  ' said Hagrid, looking startled
[22732]22    Wha' injuries
[22733]0  'All those
[22734]16839  ' said Harry, pointing at Hagrid's face
[22735]362   Oh 
[22736]0   
[22737]0   
[22738]17069    tha's jus' normal bumps an' bruises, Harry,' said Hagrid dismissively I got a rough job
[22739]1283   'He drained his tankard, set it back on the table and got to his feet
[22740]6431   I'll be seein' yeh, Harry 
[22741]0   
[22742]0   
[22743]77    take care now
[22744]703   'And he lumbered out of the pub looking wretched, and disappeared into the torrential rain
[22745]6006    Harry watched him go, feeling miserable
[22746]876    Hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something, but he seemed determined not to accept help
[22747]489    What was going on
[22748]7125   But before Harry could think about it any further, he heard a voice calling his name
[22749]5732   Harry
[22750]5732   Harry, over here
[22751]2089  'Hermione was waving at him from the other side of the room
[22752]1069    He got up and made his way towards her through the crowded pub
[22753]2043    He was still a few tables away when he realised that Hermione was not alone
[22754]7493    She was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he could ever have imagined: Luna Lovegood and none other than Rita Skeeter, ex-journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of Hermione's least favourite people in the world
[22755]41   You're early
[22756]7285  ' said Hermione, moving along to give him room to sit down
[22757]3087    I thought you were with Cho, I wasn't expecting you for another hour at least
[22758]150  ' Cho
[22759]11069  ' said Rita at once, twisting round in her seat to stare avidly at Harry
[22760]62    A girl
[22761]61  'She snatched up her crocodile-skin handbag and groped within it
[22762]12553   Its none of your business if Harry's been with a hundred girls,' Hermione told Rita coolly
[22763]901    So you can put that away right now
[22764]348   'Rita had been on the point of withdrawing an acid-green quill from her bag
[22765]889    Looking as though she had been forced to swallow Stinksap, she snapped her bag shut again
[22766]0   What are you up to
[22767]8182  ' Harry asked, sitting down and staring from Rita to Luna to Hermione
[22768]1575   Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived
[22769]5488   ' said Rita, taking a large slurp of her drink
[22770]670    I suppose I'm allowed to talk to him, am I
[22771]1663  ' she shot at Hermione
[22772]7088   Yes, I suppose you are,' said Hermione coldly
[22773]716   Unemployment did not suit Rita
[22774]869    The hair that had once been set in elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around her face
[22775]231    The scarlet paint on her two-inch talons was chipped and there were a couple of false jewels missing from her winged glasses
[22776]11694    She took another great gulp of her drink and said out of the corner of her mouth, Pretty girl, is she, Harry
[22777]26946  'One more word about Harry's love life and the deal's off and that's a promise,' said Hermione irritably
[22778]41   What deal
[22779]5674  ' said Rita, wiping her mouth on the back of her hand
[22780]3760    You haven't mentioned a deal yet, Miss Prissy you just told me to turn up
[22781]438    Oh, one of these days 
[22782]0   
[22783]0   
[22784]388   ' She took a deep shuddering breath
[22785]13765   Yes, yes, one of these days you'll write more horrible stories about Harry and me,' said Hermione indifferently
[22786]2950    Find someone who cares, why don't you
[22787]18554  ' They've run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year without my help,' said Rita, shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper, How has that made you feel, Harry
[22788]3   Betrayed
[22789]2   Distraught
[22790]5   Misunderstood
[22791]7765  'He feels angry, of course,' said Hermione in a hard, clear voice
[22792]10316    Because he's told the Minister for Magic the truth and the Minister's too much of an idiot to believe him
[22793]86   'So you actually stick to it, do you, that He Who Must Not Be Named is back
[22794]11095  ' said Rita, lowering her glass and subjecting Harry to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag
[22795]6570    You stand by all this garbage Dumbledore's been telling everybody about You-Know-Who returning and you being the sole witness
[22796]8234  'I wasn't the sole witness,' snarled Harry
[22797]333    There were a dozen-odd Death Eaters there as well
[22798]361    Want their names
[22799]1209  'I'd love them,' breathed Rita, now fumbling in her bag once more and gazing at him as though he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen
[22800]729    A great bold headline: Potter Accuses 
[22801]0   
[22802]0   
[22803]6504    A sub-heading, Harry Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us
[22804]12361    And then, beneath a nice big photograph of you, Disturbed teenage survivor of You-Know-Who's attack, Harry Potter, 15, caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the wizarding community of being Death Eaters 
[22805]0   
[22806]0   
[22807]1394    'The Quick-Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression on her face died
[22808]10787   But of course,' she said, lowering the quill and looking daggers at Hermione, Little Miss Perfect wouldn't want that story out there, would she
[22809]12527  ' As a matter of fact,' said Hermione sweetly, that's exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want
[22810]155   'Rita stared at her
[22811]6399    So did Harry
[22812]1326    Luna, on the other hand, sang Weasley is our King' dreamily under her breath and stirred her drink with a cocktail onion on a stick
[22813]466   You want me to report what he says about He Who Must Not Be Named
[22814]2557  ' Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice
[22815]6993   Yes, I do,' said Hermione
[22816]115    The true story
[22817]10    All the facts
[22818]5836    Exactly as Harry reports them
[22819]10248    He'll give you all the details, he'll tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, he'll tell you what Voldemort looks like now-oh, get a grip on yourself,' she added contemptuously, throwing a napkin across the table, for, at the sound of Voldemort's name, Rita had jumped so badly she had slopped half her glass of Firewhisky down herself
[22820]1832   Rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat, still staring at Hermione
[22821]7577    Then she said baldly, The Prophet wouldn't print it
[22822]2651    In case you haven't noticed, nobody believes his cock-and-bull story
[22823]4803    Everyone thinks he's delusional
[22824]14159    Now, if you let me write the story from that angle-'We don't need another story about how Harry's lost his marbles
[22825]6784  ' said Hermione angrily
[22826]753    We've had plenty of those already, thank you
[22827]799   I want him given the opportunity to tell the truth
[22828]10703  'There's no market for a story like that,' said Rita coldly
[22829]12428   You mean the Prophet won't print it because Fudge won't let them,' said Hermione irritably
[22830]2858   Rita gave Hermione a long, hard look
[22831]6461    Then, leaning forwards across the table towards her, she said in a businesslike tone, All right, Fudge is leaning on the Prophet, but it comes to the same thing
[22832]8732    They won't print a story that shows Harry in a good light
[22833]166    Nobody wants to read it
[22834]4792    It's against the public mood
[22835]1297    This last Azkaban breakout has got people quite worried enough
[22836]10018    People just don't want to believe You-Know-Who's back
[22837]1376   'So the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear, does it
[22838]6706  ' said Hermione scathingly
[22839]5809   Rita sat up straight again, her eyebrows raised, and drained her glass of Firewhisky,The Prophet exists to sell itself, you silly girl,' she said coldly
[22840]10238   My dad thinks it's an awful paper,' said Luna, chipping into the conversation unexpectedly
[22841]528    Sucking on her cocktail onion, she gazed at Rita with her enormous, protuberant, slightly mad eye
[22842]911    He publishes important stories he thinks the public needs to know
[22843]2611    He doesn't care about making money
[22844]855   'Rita looked disparagingly at Luna
[22845]916   I'm guessing your father runs some stupid little village newsletter
[22846]5086  ' she said
[22847]209    Probably, Twenty-five Ways to Mingle With Muggles and the dates of the next Bring and Fly Sale
[22848]10020  'No,' said Luna, dipping her onion back into her Gillywater, he's the editor of The Quibbler
[22849]1533   'Rita snorted so loudly that people at a nearby table looked round in alarm
[22850]938   "Important stories he thinks the public needs to know", eh
[22851]5088  ' she said witheringly
[22852]34    I could manure my garden with the contends of that rag
[22853]2699   ' Well, this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit, isn't it
[22854]6714  ' said Hermione pleasantly
[22855]15813    Luna says her father's quite happy to take Harry's interview
[22856]5319    That's who'll be publishing it
[22857]1055   'Rita stared at them both for a moment, then let out a great whoop of laughter
[22858]29   The Quibbler
[22859]5090  ' she said, cackling
[22860]5689    You think people will take him seriously if he's published in The Quibbler
[22861]10030  'Some people won't,' said Hermione in a level voice
[22862]4946    But the Daily Prophet's version of the Azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it
[22863]9576    I think a lot of people will be wondering whether there isn't a better explanation of what happened, and if there's an alternative story available, even if it is published in a-' she glanced sideways at Luna, in a-well, an unusual magazine-I think they might be rather keen to read it
[22864]5426   'Rita didn't say anything for a while, but eyed Hermione shrewdly, her head a little to one side
[22865]11838   All right, let's say for a moment I'll do it,' she said abruptly
[22866]577    What kind of fee am I going to get
[22867]9215  'I don't think Daddy exactly pays people to write for the magazine,' said Luna dreamily
[22868]5000    They do it because it's an honour and, of course, to see their names in print
[22869]2560   'Rita Skeeter looked as though the taste of Stinksap was strong in her mouth again as she rounded on Hermione
[22870]593   I'm supposed to do this for free
[22871]7181  'Well, yes,' said Hermione calmly, taking a sip of her drink
[22872]782    Otherwise, as you very well know, I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Animagus
[22873]5268    Of course, the Prophet might give you rather a lot for an insider's account of life in Azkaban
[22874]7531   'Rita looked as though she would have liked nothing better than to seize the paper umbrella sticking out of Hermione's drink and thrust it up her nose
[22875]4410   I don't suppose I've got any choice, have I
[22876]5918  ' said Rita, her voice shaking slightly
[22877]649    She opened her crocodile bag once more, withdrew a piece of parchment, and raised her Quick-Quotes Quill
[22878]5332   Daddy will be pleased,' said Luna brightly
[22879]4806    A muscle twitched in Rita's jaw
[22880]5814   OK, Harry
[22881]6789  ' said Hermione, turning to him
[22882]463    Ready to tell the public the truth
[22883]11366  'I suppose,' said Harry, watching Rita balancing the Quick-Quotes Quill at the ready on the parchment between them
[22884]7188   Fire away, then, Rita,' said Hermione serenely, fishing a cherry out from the bottom of her glass

[22913]34598     Luna said vaguely that she did not know how soon Rita's interview with Harry would appear in The Quibbler, that her father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, -and of course, that'll be a very important story, so Harry's might have to wait for the following issue,' said Luna
[22914]6366   Harry had not found it an easy experience to talk about the night when Voldemort had returned
[22915]1057    Rita had pressed him for every little detail and he had given her everything he could remember, knowing that this was his one big opportunity to tell the world the truth
[22916]424    He wondered how people would react to the story
[22917]656    He guessed that it would confirm a lot of people in the view that he was completely insane, not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish about Crumple-Horned Snorkacks
[22918]6231    But the breakout of Bellatrix Lestrange and her fellow Death Eaters had given Harry a burning desire to do something, whether or not it worked

[22922]11210    Seamus was shovelling down large amounts of chicken and ham pie on Dean's other side, but Harry knew he was listening
[22923]16791   It's the right thing to do, Harry,' said Neville, who was sitting opposite him
[22924]874    He was rather pale, but went on in a low voice, It must have been 
[22925]0   
[22926]0   
[22927]6    tough 
[22928]0   
[22929]0   
[22930]144    talking about it 
[22931]0   
[22932]0   
[22933]0    was it
[22934]15230  'Yeah,' mumbled Harry, but people have got to know what Voldemort's capable of, haven't they
[22935]10974  'That's right,' said Neville, nodding, and his Death Eaters, too 
[22936]0   
[22937]0   
[22938]1083    people should know 
[22939]0   
[22940]0   
[22941]708   'Neville left his sentence hanging and returned to his baked potato
[22942]12350    Seamus looked up, but when he caught Harry's eye he looked quickly back at his plate again
[22943]10959    After a while, Dean, Seamus and Neville departed for the common room, leaving Harry and Hermione at the table waiting for Ron, who had not yet had dinner because of Quidditch practice
[22944]620   Cho Chang walked into the Hall with her friend Marietta
[22945]12448    Harry's stomach gave an unpleasant lurch, but she did not look over at the Gryffindor table, and sat down with her back to him
[22946]7816   Oh, I forgot to ask you,' said Hermione brightly, glancing over at the Ravenclaw table, what happened on your date with Cho
[22947]477   How come you were back so early
[22948]121  'Er 
[22949]0   
[22950]0   
[22951]0    well, it was 
[22952]0   
[22953]0   
[22954]11058   ' said Harry, pulling a dish of rhubarb crumble towards him and helping himself to seconds, a complete fiasco, now you mention it
[22955]5321   'And he told her what had happened in Madam Puddifoot's teashop
[22956]0   
[22957]0   
[22958]0   
[22959]7699    so then,' he finished several minutes later, as the final bit of crumble disappeared, she jumps up, right, and says, I'll see you around, Harry, and runs out of the place
[22960]2295  ' He put down his spoon and looked at Hermione
[22961]231    I mean, what was all that about
[22962]489   What was going on
[22963]7096  'Hermione glanced over at the back of Cho's head and sighed
[22964]11195   Oh, Harry,' she said sadly
[22965]733    Well, I'm sorry but you were a bit tactless
[22966]3   ' Me, tactless
[22967]10827  ' said Harry, outraged
[22968]1146    One minute we were getting on fine, next minute she was telling me that Roger Davies asked her out and how she used to go and snog Cedric in that stupid teashop-how was I supposed to feel about that
[22969]9827  'Well, you see,' said Hermione, with the patient air of someone explaining that one plus one equals two to an over-emotional toddler, you shouldn't have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date
[22970]6329   'But, but,' spluttered Harry, but-you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along, how was I supposed to do that without telling her
[22971]7188  'You should have told her differently,' said Hermione, still with that maddeningly patient air
[22972]13117    You should have said it was really annoying, but I'd made you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks, and you really didn't want to go, you'd much rather spend the whole day with her, but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please, please come along with you and hopefully you'd be able to get away more quickly
[22973]2802    And it might have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think I am, too,' Hermione added as an afterthought
[22974]14365   But I don't think you're ugly,' said Harry, bemused
[22975]1667   Hermione laughed
[22976]7790   Harry, you're worse than Ron 
[22977]0   
[22978]0   
[22979]3087    well, no, you're not,' she sighed, as Ron himself came stumping into the Hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy
[22980]6591    Look-you upset Cho when you said you were going to meet me, so she tried to make you jealous
[22981]617    It was her way of trying to find out how much you liked her
[22982]182   ' Is that what she was doing
[22983]13176  ' said Harry, as Ron dropped onto the bench opposite them and pulled every dish within reach towards him
[22984]4434    Well, wouldn't it have been easier if she'd just asked me whether I liked her better than you
[22985]10565  ' Girls don't often ask questions like that,' said Hermione
[22986]0   Well, they should
[22987]10832  ' said Harry forcefully
[22988]4339    Then I could've just told her I fancy her, and she wouldn't have had to get herself all worked up again about Cedric dying
[22989]11728  'I'm not saying what she did was sensible,' said Hermione, as Ginny joined them, just as muddy as Ron and looking equally disgruntled
[22990]2410    I'm just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the time
[22991]4468   'You should write a book,' Ron told Hermione as he cut up his potatoes, translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them
[22992]11942   'Yeah,' said Harry fervently, looking over at the Ravenclaw table
[22993]2986    Cho had just got up, and, still not looking at him, she left the Great Hall
[22994]3184    Feeling rather depressed, he looked back at Ron and Ginny
[22995]186    So, how was Quidditch practice
[22996]7638  'It was a nightmare,' said Ron in a surly voice
[22997]17271   Oh come on,' said Hermione, looking at Ginny, I'm sure it wasn't that-' Yes, it was,' said Ginny
[22998]2    It was appalling
[22999]469    Angelina was nearly in tears by the end of it
[23000]10972   'Ron and Ginny went off for baths after dinner; Harry and Hermione returned to the busy Gryffindor common room and their usual pile of homework
[23001]7321    Harry had been struggling with a new star-chart for Astronomy for half an hour when Fred and George turned up
[23002]2338   Ron and Ginny not here
[23003]13389  ' asked Fred, looking around as he pulled up a chair, and when Harry shook his head, he said, Good
[23004]182    We were watching their practice
[23005]491    They're going to be slaughtered
[23006]50    They're complete rubbish without us
[23007]11639   'Come on, Ginny's not bad,' said George fairly, sitting down next to Fred
[23008]1517    Actually, I dunno how she got so good, seeing how we never let her play with us
[23009]14909   'She's been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you weren't looking,' said Hermione from behind her tottering pile of Ancient Rune books
[23010]6454   Oh,' said George, looking mildly impressed
[23011]659    Well-that'd explain it
[23012]2047   ' Has Ron saved a goal yet
[23013]2102  ' asked Hermione, peering over the top of Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms
[23014]13886   Well, he can do it if he doesn't think anyone's watching him,' said Fred, rolling his eyes
[23015]1235    So all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn their backs and talk among themselves every time the Quaffle goes up his end on Saturday
[23016]1477   ' He got up again and moved restlessly to the window, staring out across the dark grounds
[23017]1329   You know, Quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth staying for
[23018]2103   'Hermione cast him a stern look
[23019]1517   You've got exams coming
[23020]5847  'Told you already, we're not fussed about NEWTs,' said Fred
[23021]1079    The Snackboxes are ready to roll, we found out how to get rid of those boils, just a couple of drops of Murtlap essence sorts them, Lee put us on to it
[23022]1322   'George yawned widely and looked out disconsolately at the cloudy night sky
[23023]506   I dunno if I even want to watch this match
[23024]132    If Zacharias Smith beats us I might have to kill myself
[23025]6377   'Kill him, more like,' said Fred firmly
[23026]12018   That's the trouble with Quidditch,' said Hermione absent-mindedly, once again bent over her Runes translation, it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the houses
[23027]12338   'She looked up to find her copy of Spellman's Syllabary, and caught Fred, George and Harry all staring at her with expressions of mingled disgust and incredulity on their faces
[23028]89   Well, it does
[23029]5131  ' she said impatiently
[23030]7174    It's only a game, isn't it
[23031]17435  'Hermione,' said Harry, shaking his head, you're good on feelings and stuff, but you just don't understand about Quidditch
[23032]14387   'Maybe not,' she said darkly, returning to her translation, but at least my happiness doesn't depend on Ron's goalkeeping ability
[23033]6956   'And though Harry would rather have jumped off the Astronomy Tower than admit it to her, by the time he had watched the game the following Saturday he would have given any number of Galleons not to care about Quidditch either
[23034]978   The very best thing you could say about the match was that it was short; the Gryffindor spectators had to endure only twenty-two minutes of agony
[23035]14451    It was hard to say what the worst thing was: Harry thought it was a close-run contest between Ron's fourteenth failed save, Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his bat, and Kirke shrieking and falling backwards off his broom when Zacharias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle
[23036]6283    The miracle was that Gryffindor only lost by ten points: Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch from right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby's nose, so that the final score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty
[23037]7379   Good catch,' Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where the atmosphere resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral
[23038]41   I was lucky,' she shrugged
[23039]9149    It wasn't a very fast Snitch and Summerby's got a cold, he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment
[23040]1823    Anyway, once you're back on the team-'Ginny, I've got a lifelong ban
[23041]1501   'You're banned as long as Umbridge is in the school,' Ginny corrected him
[23042]4763    There's a difference
[23043]1219    Anyway, once you're back, I think I'll, try out for Chaser
[23044]9545    Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year and I prefer goal-scoring to Seeking anyway'Harry looked over at Ron, who was hunched in a corner, staring at his knees, a bottle of Butlerbeer clutched in his hand
[23045]18966   Angelina still won't let him resign,' Ginny said, as though reading Harry's mind
[23046]5591    She says she knows he's got it in him
[23047]9653   'Harry liked Angelina for the faith she was showing in Ron, but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the team
[23048]3516    Ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of Weasley is our King' sung with great gusto by the Slytherins, who were now favourites to win the Quidditch Cup
[23049]814   Fred and George wandered over
[23050]16134   I haven't even got the heart to take the mickey out of him,' said Fred, looking over at Ron's crumpled figure
[23051]151    Mind you 
[23052]0   
[23053]0   
[23054]326    when he missed the fourteenth-'He made wild motions with his arms as though doing an upright doggy-paddle
[23055]639   -well, I'll save it for parties, eh
[23056]2232  'Ron dragged himself up to bed shortly after this
[23057]8552    Out of respect for his feelings, Harry waited a while before going up to the dormitory himself, so that Ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to
[23058]8985    Sure enough, when Harry finally entered the room Ron was snoring a little too loudly to be entirely plausible
[23059]6733   Harry got into bed, thinking about the match
[23060]157    It had been immensely frustrating watching from the sidelines
[23061]5770    He was quite impressed by Ginny's performance but he knew if he had been playing he could have caught the Snitch sooner 
[23062]0   
[23063]0   
[23064]8182    there had been a moment when it had been fluttering near Kirke's ankle; if Ginny hadn't hesitated, she might have been able to scrape a win for Gryffindor
[23065]8055   Umbridge had been sitting a few rows below Harry and Hermione
[23066]6426    Once or twice she had turned squatly in her seat to look at him, her wide toad's mouth stretched in what he thought had been a gloating smile
[23067]641    The memory of it made him feel hot with anger as he lay there in the dark
[23068]1330    After a few minutes, however, he remembered that he was supposed to be emptying his mind of all emotion before he slept, as Snape kept instructing him at the end of every Occlumency lesson
[23069]2078   He tried for a moment or two, but the thought of Snape on top of memories of Umbridge merely increased his sense of grumbling resentment and he found himself focusing instead on how much he loathed the pair of them
[23070]7532    Slowly, Ron's snores died away to be replaced by the sound of deep, slow breathing
[23071]7403    It took Harry much longer to get to sleep; his body was tired, but it took his brain a long time to close down
[23072]2589   He dreamed that Neville and Professor Sprout were waltzing around the Room of Requirement while Professor McGonagall played the bagpipes
[23073]236    He watched them happily for a while, then decided to go and find the other members of the DA
[23074]1060   But when he left the room he found himself facing, not the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy, but a torch burning in its bracket on a stone wall
[23075]1223    He turned his head slowly to the left
[23076]1129    There, at the far end of the windowless passage, was a plain, black door
[23077]223   He walked towards it with a sense of mounting excitement
[23078]1841    He had the strangest feeling that this time he was going to get lucky at last, and find the way to open it 
[23079]0   
[23080]0   
[23081]1749    he was feet from it, and saw with a leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light down the right-hand side 
[23082]0   
[23083]0   
[23084]504    the door was ajar 
[23085]0   
[23086]0   
[23087]10675    he stretched out his hand to push it wide and-Ron gave a loud, rasping, genuine snore and Harry awoke abruptly with his right hand stretched in front of him in the darkness, to open a door that was hundreds of miles away
[23088]540    He let it fall with a feeling of mingled disappointment and guilt
[23089]4131    He knew he should not have seen the door, but at the same time felt so consumed with curiosity about what was behind it that he could not help feeling annoyed with Ron 
[23090]0   
[23091]0   
[23092]877    if only he could have saved his snore for just another minute
[23093]1149   They entered the Great Hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment as the post owls on Monday morning
[23094]2448    Hermione was not the only person eagerly awaiting her Daily Prophet: nearly everyone was eager for more news about the escaped Death Eaters, who, despite many reported sightings, had still not been caught
[23095]6882    She gave the delivery owl a Knut and unfolded the newspaper eagerly while Harry helped himself to orange juice; as he had only received one note during the entire year, he was sure, when the first owl landed with a thud in front of him, that it had made a mistake
[23096]0   Who're you after
[23097]11440  ' he asked it, languidly removing his orange juice from underneath its beak and leaning forwards to see the recipient's name and address:Harry PotterGreat HallHogwarts SchoolFrowning, he made to take the letter from the owl, but before he could do so, three, four, five more owls had fluttered down beside it and were jockeying for position, treading in the butter and knocking over the salt as each one attempted to give him their letter first
[23098]5239   What's going on
[23099]3169  ' Ron asked in amazement, as the whole of Gryffindor table leaned forwards to watch and another seven owls landed amongst the first ones, screeching, hooting and flapping their wings
[23100]5732   Harry
[23101]7484  ' said Hermione breathlessly, plunging her hands into the feathery mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long, cylindrical package
[23102]1623    I think I know what this means-open this one first
[23103]5786  'Harry ripped off the brown packaging
[23104]142    Out rolled a tightly furled copy of the March edition of The Quibbler
[23105]607   He unrolled it to see his own face grinning sheepishly at him from the front cover
[23106]14755    In large red letters across this picture were the words:HARRY POTTER SPEAKS OUT AT LAST:THE TRUTH ABOUT HE WHO MUST NOT BE NAMEDAND THE NIGHT I SAW HIM RETURNIt's good, isn't it
[23107]8113  ' said Luna, who had drifted over to the Gryffindor table and now squeezed herself on to the bench between Fred and Ron
[23108]806    It came out yesterday, I asked Dad to send you a free copy
[23109]6488    I expect all these,' she waved a hand at the assembled owls still scrabbling around on the table in front of Harry, are letters from readers
[23110]11890   'That's what I thought,' said Hermione eagerly
[23111]6504    Harry, d'you mind if we-
[23112]11301  'Help yourself,' said Harry, feeling slightly bemused
[23113]3993   Ron and Hermione both started ripping open envelopes
[23114]12018   This one's from a bloke who thinks you're off your rocker,' said Ron, glancing down his letter
[23115]51    Ah well 
[23116]0   
[23117]0   
[23118]832   'This woman recommends you try a good course of Shock Spells at St
[23119]12269    Mungo's,' said Hermione, looking disappointed and crumpling up a second
[23120]11647   This one looks OK, though,' said Harry slowly scanning a long letter from a witch in Paisley
[23121]117    Hey she says she believes me
[23122]10422  'This one's in two minds,' said Fred, who had joined in the letter-opening with enthusiasm
[23123]16041    Says you don't come across as a mad person, but he really doesn't want to believe You-Know-Who's back so he doesn't know what to think now
[23124]148    Blimey, what a waste of parchment
[23125]11198   'Here's another one you've convinced, Harry
[23126]6728  ' said Hermione excitedly
[23127]458    Having read your side of the story, I am forced to the conclusion that the Daily Prophet has treated you very unfairly 
[23128]0   
[23129]0   
[23130]1448    little though I want to think that He Who Must Not Be Named has returned, I am forced to accept that you are telling the truth 
[23131]0   
[23132]0   
[23133]389   Oh, this is wonderful
[23134]7394  'Another one who thinks you're barking,' said Ron, throwing a crumpled letter over his shoulder 
[23135]0   
[23136]0   
[23137]6366    but this one says you've got her converted and she now thinks you're a real hero-she's put in a photograph, too-wow
[23138]489  'What is going on here
[23139]5652  ' said a falsely sweet, girlish voice
[23140]6592   Harry looked up with his hands full of envelopes
[23141]13359    Professor Umbridge was standing behind Fred and Luna, her bulging toad's eyes scanning the mess of owls and letters on the table in front of Harry
[23142]621    Behind her he saw many of the students watching them avidly
[23143]1099   Why have you got all these letters, Mr
[23144]461    Potter
[23145]482  ' she asked slowly
[23146]5   Is that a crime now
[23147]5650  ' said Fred loudly
[23148]123    Getting mail
[23149]6739  'Be careful, Mr Weasley or I shall have to put you in detention,' said Umbridge
[23150]833    Well, Mr Potter
[23151]12777  'Harry hesitated, but he did not see how he could keep what he had done quiet; it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of The Quibbler came to Umbridge's attention
[23152]11411   People have written to me because I gave an interview,' said Harry
[23153]152    About what happened to me last June
[23154]5433   'For some reason he glanced up at the staff table as he said this
[23155]8577    Harry had the strangest feeling that Dumbledore had been watching him a second before, but when he looked towards the Headmaster he seemed to be absorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick
[23156]14   An interview
[23157]1187  ' repeated Umbridge, her voice thinner and higher than ever
[23158]231    What do you mean
[23159]11465  'I mean a reporter asked me questions and I answered them,' said Harry
[23160]123    Here-'And he threw the copy of The Quibbler to her
[23161]258    She caught it and stared down at the cover
[23162]952    Her pale, doughy face turned an ugly, patchy violet
[23163]667   When did you do this
[23164]1098  ' she asked, her voice trembling slightly
[23165]10862   Last Hogsmeade weekend,' said Harry
[23166]906   She looked up at him, incandescent with rage, the magazine shaking in her stubby fingers
[23167]399   There will be no more Hogsmeade trips for you, Mr
[23168]584    Potter,' she whispered
[23169]23    How you dare 
[23170]0   
[23171]0   
[23172]0    how you could 
[23173]0   
[23174]0   
[23175]378   ' She took a deep breath
[23176]516    I have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lies
[23177]93    The message, apparently, has still not sunk in
[23178]5127    Fifty points from Gryffindor and another week's worth of detentions
[23179]1146   'She stalked away, clutching The Quibbler to her chest, the eyes of many students following her
[23180]1490   By mid-morning enormous signs had been put up all over the school, not just on house noticeboards, but in the corridors and classrooms too
[23181]608   BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS Any student found in possession of the magazineThe Quibblerwill be expelled
[23182]164    The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty-seven
[23183]3235    Signed: Dolores Jane Umbridge, High InquisitorFor some reason, every time Hermione caught sight of one of these signs she beamed with pleasure
[23184]155   What exactly are you so happy about
[23185]6088  ' Harry asked her
[23186]9035   Oh, Harry, don't you see
[23187]1637  ' Hermione breathed
[23188]1124    If she could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview, it was banning it
[23189]2360  'And it seemed that Hermione was quite right
[23190]6843    By the end of the day, though Harry had not seen so much as a corner of The Quibbler anywhere in the school, the whole place seemed to be quoting the interview to each other
[23191]8139    Harry heard them whispering about it as they queued up outside classes, discussing it over lunch and in the back of lessons, while Hermione even reported that every occupant of the cubicles in the girls' toilets had been talking about it when she nipped in there before Ancient Runes
[23192]16519   Then they spotted me, and obviously they know I know you, so they bombarded me with questions,' Hermione told Harry, her eyes shining, and Harry, I think they believe you, I really do
[23193]2027    I think you've finally got them convinced
[23194]8811  'Meanwhile, Professor Umbridge was stalking the school, stopping students at random and demanding that they turn out their books and pockets: Harry knew she was looking for copies of The Quibbler, but the students were several steps ahead of her
[23195]10938    The pages carrying Harry's interview had been bewitched to resemble extracts from textbooks if anyone but themselves read it, or else wiped magically blank until they wanted to peruse it again
[23196]543    Soon it seemed that every single person in the school had read it
[23197]474   The teachers were of course forbidden from mentioning the interview by Educational Decree Number Twenty-six, but they found ways to express their feelings about it all the same
[23198]13139    Professor Sprout awarded Gryffindor twenty points when Harry passed her a watering can; a beaming Professor Flitwick pressed a box of squeaking sugar mice on him at the end of Charms, said, Shh
[23199]9057  ' and hurried away; and Professor Trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during Divination and announced to the startled class, and a very disapproving Umbridge, that Harry was not going to suffer an early death after all, but would live to a ripe old age, become Minister for Magic and have twelve children
[23200]6125   But what made Harry happiest was Cho catching up with him as he was hurrying along to Transfiguration the next day
[23201]1983    Before he knew what had happened, her hand was in his and she was breathing in his ear, I'm really, really sorry
[23202]33    That interview was so brave 
[23203]0   
[23204]0   
[23205]0    it made me cry
[23206]791   'He was sorry to hear she had shed even more tears over it, but very glad they were on speaking terms again, and even more pleased when she gave him a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off again
[23207]2202    And unbelievably, no sooner had he arrived outside Transfiguration than something just as good happened: Seamus stepped out of the queue to face him
[23208]12155   I just wanted to say,' he mumbled, squinting at Harry's left knee, I believe you
[23209]822    And I've sent a copy of that magazine to me mam
[23210]11847   'If anything more was needed to complete Harry's happiness, it was the reaction he got from Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle
[23211]3185    He saw them with their heads together later that afternoon in the library; they were with a weedy-looking boy Hermione whispered was called Theodore Nott
[23212]6673    They looked round at Harry as he browsed the shelves for the book he needed on Partial Vanishment
[23213]760    Goyle cracked his knuckles threateningly and Malfoy whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to Crabbe
[23214]7070    Harry knew perfectly well why they were acting like this: he had named all of their fathers as Death Eaters
[23215]7805   And the best bit,' whispered Hermione gleefully, as they left the library, is they can't contradict you, because they can't admit they've read the article
[23216]580  'To cap it all, Luna told him over dinner that no issue of The Quibbler had ever sold out faster
[23217]4861   Dad's reprinting
[23218]6578  ' she told Harry, her eyes popping excitedly
[23219]2849    He can't believe it, he says people seem even more interested in this than the Crumple-Horned Snorkacks
[23220]6673  'Harry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night
[23221]14521    Daringly, Fred and George had put an Enlargement Charm on the front cover of The Quibbler and hung it on the wall, so that Harry's giant head gazed down upon the proceedings, occasionally saying things like THE MINISTRY ARE MORONS' and EAT DUNG, UMBRIDGE' in a booming voice
[23222]8122    Hermione did not find this very amusing; she said it interfered with her concentration, and she ended up going to bed early out of irritation
[23223]8609    Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had started to wear off, so that it merely shouted disconnected words like DUNG' and UMBRIDGE' at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice
[23224]1127    In fact, it started to make his head ache and his scar began prickling uncomfortably again
[23225]1333    To disappointed moans from the many people who were sitting around him, asking him to relive his interview for the umpteenth time, he announced that he too needed an early night
[23226]183   The dormitory was empty when he reached it
[23227]1157    He rested his forehead for a moment against the cool glass of the window beside his bed; it felt soothing against his scar
[23228]1230    Then he undressed and got into bed, wishing his headache would go away
[23229]480    He also felt slightly sick
[23230]786    He rolled over on to his side, closed his eyes, and fell asleep almost at once 
[23231]0   
[23232]0   
[23233]1014   He was standing in a dark, curtained room lit by a single branch of candles
[23234]310    His hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of him
[23235]2986    They were long-fingered and white as though they had not seen sunlight for years and looked like large, pale spiders agairst the dark velvet of the chair
[23236]1101   Beyond the chair, in a pool of light cast upon the floor by the candles, knelt a man in black robes
[23237]11657   I have been badly advised, it seems,' said Harry, in a high, cold voice that pulsed with anger
[23238]466   Master, I crave your pardon,' croaked the man kneeling on the floor
[23239]504    The back of his head glimmered in the candlelight
[23240]39    He seemed to be trembling
[23241]11500   I do not blame you, Rookwood,' said Harry in that cold, cruel voice
[23242]1825   He relinquished his grip on the chair and walked around it, closer to the man cowering on the floor, until he stood directly over him in the darkness, looking down from a far greater height than usual
[23243]254   You are sure of your facts, Rookwood
[23244]6088  ' asked Harry
[23245]671   Yes, My Lord, yes 
[23246]0   
[23247]0   
[23248]242    I used to work in the Department aftet-after all 
[23249]0   
[23250]0   
[23251]494   'Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it
[23252]145   'Bode could never have taken it, Master 
[23253]0   
[23254]0   
[23255]66    Bode would have known he could not 
[23256]0   
[23257]0   
[23258]5440    undoubtedly, that is why he fought so hard against Malfoy's Imperius Curse 
[23259]0   
[23260]0   
[23261]5939   'Stand up, Rookwood,' whispered Harry
[23262]280   The kneeling man almost fell over in his haste to obey
[23263]603    His face was pockmarked; the scars were thrown into relief by the candlelight
[23264]11685    He remained a little stooped when standing, as though halfway through a bow, and he darted terrified looks up at Harry's face
[23265]11150   You have done well to tell me this,' said Harry
[23266]0    Very well 
[23267]0   
[23268]0   
[23269]57    I have wasted months on fruitless schemes, it seems 
[23270]0   
[23271]0   
[23272]86    but no matter 
[23273]0   
[23274]0   
[23275]10    we begin again, from now
[23276]5091    You have Lord Voldemort's gratitude, Rookwood 
[23277]0   
[23278]0   
[23279]87   'My Lord 
[23280]0   
[23281]0   
[23282]1016    yes, My Lord,' gasped Rookwood, his voice hoarse with relief
[23283]328   I shall need your help
[23284]219    I shall need all the information you can give me
[23285]521   ' Of course, My Lord, of course 
[23286]0   
[23287]0   
[23288]0    anything 
[23289]0   
[23290]0   
[23291]0   'Very well

[23293]0   
[23294]0    you may go
[23295]25    Send Avery to me
[23296]611   'Rookwood scurried backwards, bowing, and disappeared through a door
[23297]7231   Left alone in the dark room, Harry turned towards the wall
[23298]284    A cracked, age-spotted mirror hung on the wall in the shadows
[23299]5810    Harry moved towards it
[23300]109    His reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness 
[23301]0   
[23302]0   
[23303]533    a face whiter than a skull 
[23304]0   
[23305]0   
[23306]583    red eyes with slits for pupils 
[23307]0   
[23308]0   
[23309]1   NOOOOOOOOO
[23310]0  'What
[23311]641  ' yelled a voice nearby
[23312]6078   Harry Hailed around madly, became entangled in the hangings and fell out of his bed
[23313]10080    For a few seconds he did not know where he was; he was convinced he was about to see the white, skull-like lace looming at him out of the dark again, then very near to him Ron's voice spoke
[23314]886   Will you stop acting like a maniac so I can get you out of here
[23315]8120  'Ron wrenched the hangings apart and Harry stared up at him in the moonlight, flat on his back, his scar searing with pain
[23316]4116    Ron looked as though he had just been getting ready for bed; one arm was out of his robes
[23317]58   Has someone been attacked again
[23318]8416  ' asked Ron, pulling Harry roughly to his feet
[23319]110    Is it Dad
[23320]64   Is it that snake
[23321]10919  'No-everyone's fine-' gasped Harry, whose forehead felt as though it were on fire
[23322]0    Well 
[23323]0   
[23324]0   
[23325]2415    Avery isn't 
[23326]0   
[23327]0   
[23328]4818    he's in trouble 
[23329]0   
[23330]0   
[23331]342    he gave him the wrong information 
[23332]0   
[23333]0   
[23334]5337    Voldemort's really angry 
[23335]0   
[23336]0   
[23337]6170   'Harry groaned and sank, shaking, on to his bed, rubbing his scar
[23338]5401   But Rookwood's going to help him now 
[23339]0   
[23340]0   
[23341]5314    he's on the right track again 
[23342]0   
[23343]0   
[23344]144   ' What are you talking about
[23345]7160  ' said Ron, sounding scared
[23346]852    D'you mean 
[23347]0   
[23348]0   
[23349]2246    did you just see You-Know-Who
[23350]12962  'I was You-Know-Who,' said Harry, and he stretched out his hands in the darkness and held them up to his face, to check that they were no longer deathly white and long-fingered
[23351]5201    He was with Rookwood, he's one of the Death Eaters who escaped from Azkaban, remember
[23352]8358   Rookwood's just told him Bode couldn't have done it
[23353]0   'Done what
[23354]16  'Remove something 
[23355]0   
[23356]0   
[23357]7589    he said Bode would have known he couldn't have done it 
[23358]0   
[23359]0   
[23360]76    Bode was under the Imperius Curse 
[23361]0   
[23362]0   
[23363]10948    I think he said Malfoy's dad put it on him
[23364]52   'Bode was bewitched to remove something
[23365]7088  ' Ron said
[23366]17022    But-Harry, that's got to be-'The weapon,' Harry finished the sentence for him
[23367]771    I know
[23368]1087   'The dormitory door opened; Dean and Seamus came in
[23369]6031    Harry swung his legs back into bed
[23370]9344    He did not want to look as though anything odd had just happened, seeing as Seamus had only just stopped thinking Harry was a nutter
[23371]15130   Did you say,' murmured Ron, putting his head close to Harry's on the pretence of helping himself to water from the jug on his bedside table, that you were You-Know-Who
[23372]11232  'Yeah,' said Harry quietly
[23373]8620   Ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water; Harry saw it spill over his chin on to his chest
[23374]27368   Harry,' he said, as Dean and Seamus clattered around noisily, pulling off their robes and talking, you've got to tell-'I haven't got to tell anyone,' said Harry shortly
[23375]2640    I wouldn't have seen it at all if I could do Occlumency
[23376]730    I'm supposed to have learned to shut this stuff out
[23377]5085    That's what they want
[23378]863   'By they' he meant Dumbledore
[23379]10010    He got back into bed and rolled over on to his side with his back to Ron and after a while he heard Ron's mattress creak as he, too, lay back down
[23380]11386    Harry's scar began to burn; he bit hard on his pillow to stop himself making a noise
[23381]291    Somewhere, he knew, Avery was being punished
[23382]10533   Harry and Ron waited until break next morning to tell Hermione exactly what had happened; they wanted to be absolutely sure they could not be overheard
[23383]6603    Standing in their usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard, Harry told her every detail of the dream he could remember
[23384]6434    When he had finished, she said nothing at all for a few moments, but stared with a kind of painful intensity at Fred and George, who were both headless and selling their magical hats from under their cloaks on the other side of the yard
[23385]10836   So that's why they killed him,' she said quietly, withdrawing her gaze from Fred and George at last
[23386]391    When Bode tried to steal this weapon, something funny happened to him
[23387]1091    I think there must be defensive spells on it, or around it, to stop people touching it
[23388]4790    That's why he was in St
[23389]2791    Mungos, his brain had gone all funny and he couldn't talk
[23390]449    But remember what the Healer told us
[23391]4   He was recovering
[23392]2754    And they couldn't risk him getting better, could they
[23393]616   I mean, the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift
[23394]5733    Once he'd got his voice back, he'd explain what he'd been doing, wouldn't he
[23395]784   They would have known he'd been sent to steal the weapon
[23396]778    Of course, it would have been easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him
[23397]220    Never out of the Ministry, is he
[23398]11086  'He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,' said Harry
[23399]18    In the-hang on 
[23400]0   
[23401]0   
[23402]5212   ' he said slowly
[23403]394    He was in the Department of Mysteries corridor that day
[23404]5736   Your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing, but what if-'Sturgis
[23405]2265  ' gasped Hermione, looking thunderstruck
[23406]95   Sorry
[23407]7703  ' said Ron, looking bewildered
[23408]7489   Sturgis Podmore -' said Hermione breathlessly, arrested for trying to get through a door
[23409]1184   Lucius Malfoy must have got him too
[23410]6927   I bet he did it the day you saw him there, Harry
[23411]5552    Sturgis had Moody's Invisibility Cloak, right
[23412]3660   So, what if he was standing guard by the door, invisible, and Malfoy heard him move-or guessed someone was there-or just did the Imperius Curse on the off-chance there'd be a guard there
[23413]3647   So, when Sturgis next had an opportunity-probably when it was his turn on guard duty again-he tried to get into the Department to steal the weapon for Voldemort-Ron, be quiet-but he got caught and sent to Azkaban 
[23414]0   
[23415]0   
[23416]5758   'She gazed at Harry
[23417]5356   And now Rookwood's told Voldemort how to get the weapon
[23418]19285  'I didn't hear all the conversation, but that's what it sounded like,' said Harry
[23419]190    Rookwood used to work there 
[23420]0   
[23421]0   
[23422]909    maybe Voldemort'll send Rookwood to do it
[23423]2182  'Hermione nodded, apparently still lost in thought
[23424]13540    Then, quite abruptly, she said, But you shouldn't have seen this at all, Harry
[23425]0   'What
[23426]5175  ' he said, taken aback
[23427]7420   You're supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort of thing,' said Hermione, suddenly stern
[23428]11589   I know I am,' said Harry
[23429]8552    But-'Well, I think we should just try and forget what you saw,' said Hermione firmly
[23430]312    And you ought to put in a bit more effort on your Occlumency from now on
[23431]6952   'Harry was so angry with her he did not talk to her for the rest of the day, which proved to be another bad one
[23432]6791    When people were not discussing the escaped Death Eaters in the corridors, they were laughing at Gryffindor's abysmal performance in their match against Hufflepuff; the Slytherins were singing Weasley is our King' so loudly and frequently that by sundown Filch had banned it from the corridors out of sheer irritation
[23433]730   The week did not improve as it progressed
[23434]20459    Harry received two more Ds in Potions; he was still on tenterhooks that Hagrid might get the sack; and he couldn't stop himself dwelling on the dream in which he had been Voldemort-though he didn't bring it up with Ron and Hermione again; he didn't want another telling-off from Hermione
[23435]1114    He wished very much that he could have talked to Sirius about it, but that was out of the question, so he tried to push the matter to the back of his mind
[23436]418   Unfortunately, the back of his mind was no longer the secure place it had once been
[23437]461   Get up, Potter
[23438]12364   'A couple of weeks after his dream of Rookwood, Harry was to be found, yet again, kneeling on the floor of Snape's office, trying to clear his head
[23439]1370    He had just been forced, yet again, to relive a stream of very early memories he had not even realised he still had, most of them concerning humiliations Dudley and his gang had inflicted upon him in primary school
[23440]5608   That last memory,' said Snape
[23441]0    What was it
[23442]14899  'I don't know,' said Harry, getting wearily to his feet
[23443]840    He was finding it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memories from the rush of images and sound that Snape kept calling forth
[23444]679    You mean the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet
[23445]5612  'No,' said Snape softly
[23446]875    I mean the one with a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened room 
[23447]0   
[23448]0   
[23449]4750   'It's 
[23450]0   
[23451]0   
[23452]10818    nothing,' said Harry
[23453]16521   Snape's dark eyes bored into Harry's
[23454]12533    Remembering what Snape had said about eye contact being crucial to Legilimency, Harry blinked and looked away
[23455]2151   How do that man and that room come to be inside your head, Potter
[23456]5566  ' said Snape
[23457]12767   It-' said Harry, looking everywhere but at Snape, it was-just a dream I had
[23458]56   'A dream
[23459]533  ' repeated Snape
[23460]6306   There was a pause during which Harry stared fixedly at a large dead frog suspended in a jar of purple liquid
[23461]4173   You do know why we are here, don't you, Potter
[23462]6239  ' said Snape, in a low, dangerous voice
[23463]893    You do know why I am giving up my evenings to this tedious job
[23464]11120  'Yes,' said Harry stiffly
[23465]473   Remind me why we are here, Potter
[23466]10992   'So I can learn Occlumency, said Harry, now glaring at a dead eel
[23467]477   Correct, Potter
[23468]7419    And dim though you may be-' Harry looked back at Snape, hating him -I would have thought that after over two months of lessons you might have made some progress
[23469]430    How many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had
[23470]6553  'Just that one,' lied Harry
[23471]7288   Perhaps,' said Snape, his dark, cold eyes narrowing slightly, perhaps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams, Potter
[23472]476    Maybe they make you feel special- important
[23473]14461  'No, they don't,' said Harry, his jaw set and his fingers clenched tightly around the handle of his wand
[23474]7692   That is just as well, Potter,' said Snape coldly, because you are neither special nor important, and it is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters
[23475]7205   'No-that's your job, isn't it
[23476]5780  ' Harry shot at him
[23477]421   He had not meant to say it; it had burst out of him in temper
[23478]6764    For a long moment they stared at each other, Harry convinced he had gone too far
[23479]5870    But there was a curious, almost satisfied expression on Snape's face when he answered
[23480]6325   Yes, Potter,' he said, his eyes glinting
[23481]46    That is my job
[23482]155    Now, if you are ready, we will start again
[23483]537   'He raised his wand: One-two-three-Legilimens

[23496]12267    yet he could also see Snape standing in front of him, his eyes fixed on Harry's face, muttering under his breath 
[23497]0   
[23498]0   
[23499]658    and somehow, Snape was growing clearer, and the dementors were growing fainter 
[23500]0   
[23501]0   
[23502]6263   Harry raised his own wand
[23503]4   Protego
[23504]18793  'Snape staggered- his wand flew upwards, away from Harry-and suddenly Harry's mind was teeming with memories that were not his: a hook-nosed man was shouting at a cowering woman, while a small dark-haired boy cried in a corner 
[23505]0   
[23506]0   
[23507]1124    a greasy-haired teenager sat alone in a dark bedroom, pointing his wand at the ceiling, shooting down flies 
[23508]0   
[23509]0   
[23510]412    a girl was laughing as a scrawny boy tried to mount a bucking broomstick-ENOUGH
[23511]12154  'Harry felt as though he had been pushed hard in the chest; he staggered several steps backwards, hit some of the shelves covering Snape's walls and heard something crack
[23512]1342    Snape was shaking slightly, and was very white in the face
[23513]10653   The back of Harry's robes was damp
[23514]460    One of the jars behind him had broken when he fell against it; the pickled slimy thing within was swirling in its draining potion
[23515]538   Reparo,' hissed Snape, and the jar sealed itself at once
[23516]461    Well, Potter 
[23517]0   
[23518]0   
[23519]45    that was certainly an improvement 
[23520]0   
[23521]0   
[23522]867   ' Panting slightly, Snape straightened the Pensieve in which he had again stored some of his thoughts before starting the lesson, almost as though he was checking they were still there
[23523]3305    I don't remember telling you to use a Shield Charm 
[23524]0   
[23525]0   
[23526]30    but there is no doubt that it was effective 
[23527]0   
[23528]0   
[23529]7072   'Harry did not speak; he felt that to say anything might be dangerous
[23530]12543    He was sure he had just broken into Snape's memories, that he had just seen scenes from Snape's childhood
[23531]1874    It was unnerving to think that the little boy who had been crying as he watched his parents shouting was actually standing in front of him with such loathing in his eyes
[23532]5156   Let's try again, shall we
[23533]5566  ' said Snape
[23534]7226   Harry felt a thrill of dread; he was about to pay for what had just happened, he was sure of it
[23535]7362    They moved back into position with the desk between them, Harry feeling he was going to find it much harder to empty his mind this time
[23536]6024   On the count of three, then,' said Snape, raising his wand once more
[23537]7744    One-two-'Harry did not have time to gather himself together and attempt to clear his mind before Snape cried, Legilimens
[23538]3420  'He was hurtling along the corridor towards the Department of Masteries, past the blank stone walls, past the torches-the plain black door was growing ever larger; he was moving so fast he was going to collide with it, he was feet from it and again he could see that chink of faint blue light-The door had flown open
[23539]1958   He was through it at last, inside a black-walled, black-floored circular room lit with blue-flamed candles, and there were more doors all around him-he needed to go on-but which door ought he to take-
[23540]23  P OTTER
[23541]6382  'Harry opened his eyes
[23542]3007    He was flat on his back again with no memory of having got there; he was also panting as though his really had run the length of the Department of Mysteries corridor, really had sprinted through the black door and found the circular room
[23543]38   Explain yourself
[23544]6347  ' said Snape, who was standing over him, looking furious
[23545]0   I 
[23546]0   
[23547]0   
[23548]11159    dunno what happened,' said Harry truthfully, standing up
[23549]991    There was a lump on the back of his head from where he had hit the ground and he felt feverish
[23550]876    I've never seen that before
[23551]1760    I mean, I told you, I've dreamed about the door 
[23552]0   
[23553]0   
[23554]4920    but it's never opened before 
[23555]0   
[23556]0   
[23557]206   'You are not working hard enough
[23558]11391  'For some reason, Snape seemed even angrier than he had done two minutes before, when Harry had seen into his teacher's memories
[23559]1513   You are lazy and sloppy, Potter, it is small wonder that the Dark Lord-' Can you tell me something, sir
[23560]10821  ' said Harry, firing up again
[23561]630    Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord
[23562]1215   I've only ever heard Death Eaters call him that
[23563]1505   ' Snape opened his mouth in a snarl-and a woman screamed from somewhere outside the room
[23564]5886   Snape's head jerked upwards; he was gazing at the ceiling
[23565]0   What the-
[23566]107  ' he muttered
[23567]6713   Harry could hear a muffled commotion coming from what he thought might be the Entrance Hall
[23568]1322    Snape looked round at him, frowning
[23569]1496   Did you see anything unusual on your way down here, Potter
[23570]6288  'Harry shook his head
[23571]97    Somewhere above them, the woman screamed again
[23572]1889    Snape strode to his office door, his wand still held at the ready, and swept out of sight
[23573]6144    Harry hesitated for a moment, then followed
[23574]6462   The screams were indeed coming from the Entrance Hall; they grew louder as Harry ran towards the stone steps leading up from the dungeons
[23575]2139    When he reached the top he found the Entrance Hall packed; students had come flooding out of the Great Hall, where dinner was still in progress, to see what was going on; others had crammed themselves on to the marble staircase
[23576]7190    Harry pushed forwards through a knot of tall Slytherins and saw that the onlookers had formed a great ring, some of them looking shocked, others even frightened
[23577]8018    Professor McGonagall was directly opposite Harry en the other side of the Hall; she looked as though what she was watching made her feel faintly sick
[23578]2827   Professor Trelawney was standing in the middle of the Entrance Hall with her wand in one hand and an empty sherry bottle in the other, looking utterly mad
[23579]866    Her hair was sticking up on end, her glasses were lopsided so that one eye was magnified more than the other; her innumerable shawls and scarves were trailing haphazardly from her shoulders, giving the impression that she was falling apart at the seams
[23580]1392    Two large trunks lay on the floor beside her, one of them upside-down; it looked very much as though it had been thrown down the stairs after her
[23581]7129    Professor Trelawney was staring, apparently terrified, at something Harry could not see but which seemed to be standing at the foot of the stairs
[23582]0   No
[23583]29  ' she shrieked
[23584]0    NO
[23585]34   This cannot be happening 
[23586]0   
[23587]0   
[23588]0    it cannot 
[23589]0   
[23590]0   
[23591]9    I retuse to accept it
[23592]2837  'You didn't realise this was coming
[23593]18851  ' said a high girlish voice, sounding callously amused, and Harry, moving slightly to his right, saw that Trelawney's terrifying vision was nothing other than Professor Umbridge
[23594]344    Incapable though you are of predicting even tomorrows weather, you must surely have realised that your pitiful performance during my inspections, and lack of any improvement, would make it inevitable that you would be sacked
[23595]2345  'You c-can't
[23596]3832  ' howled Professor Trelawney, tears streaming down her face from behind her enormous lenses, you c-can't sack me
[23597]893   I've b-been here sixteen years
[23598]767   H- Hogwarts is m-my h-home
[23599]14344  'It was your home,' said Professor Umbridge, and Harry was revolted to see the enjoyment stretching her toadlike face as she watched Professor Trelawney sink, sobbing uncontrollably, on to one of her trunks, until an hour ago, when the Minister for Magic countersigned your Order of Dismissal
[23600]234    Now kindly remove yourself from this Hall
[23601]1    You are embarrassing us
[23602]1365   'But she stood and watched, with an expression of gloating enjoyment, as Professor Trelawney shuddered and moaned, rocking backwards and forwards on her trunk in paroxysms of grief
[23603]6977    Harry heard a muffled sob to his left and looked around
[23604]442    Lavender and Parvati were both crying quietly, their arms round each other
[23605]318    Then he heard footsteps
[23606]2787    Professor McGonagall had broken away from the spectators, marched straight up to Professor Trelawney and was patting her firmly on the back while withdrawing a large handkerchief from within her robes
[23607]11   There, there, Sybill 
[23608]0   
[23609]0   
[23610]31    calm down

[23614]0   
[23615]0   
[23616]5404    it's not as bad as you think, now 
[23617]0   
[23618]0   
[23619]851    you are not going to have to leave Hogwarts 
[23620]0   
[23621]0   
[23622]1656   ' Oh really, Professor McGonagall
[23623]6459  ' said Umbridge in a deadly voice, taking a few steps forward
[23624]20    And your authority for that statement is 
[23625]0   
[23626]0   
[23627]0    
[23628]5703  'That would be mine,' said a deep voice
[23629]384   The oaken front doors had swung open
[23630]1490    Students beside them scuttled out of the way as Dumbledore appeared in the entrance
[23631]6363    What he had been doing out in the grounds Harry could not imagine, but there was something impressive about the sight of him framed in the doorway against an oddly misty night
[23632]2582    Leaving the doors wide open behind him he strode forwards through the circle of onlookers towards Professor Trelawney, tear-stained and trembling, on her trunk, Professor McGonagall alongside her
[23633]1568   Yours, Professor Dumbledore
[23634]6017  ' said Umbridge, with a singularly unpleasant little laugh
[23635]594    I'm afraid you do not understand the position
[23636]912    I have here-' she pulled a parchment scroll from within her robes -an Order of Dismissal signed by myself and the Minister for Magic
[23637]1674    Under the terms of Educational Decree Number Twenty-three, the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts has the power to inspect, place upon probation and sack any teacher she-that is to say, I-feel is not performing to the standards required by the Ministry of Magic
[23638]879    I have decided that Professor Trelawney is not up to scratch
[23639]2    I have dismissed her
[23640]11784   'To Harry's very great surprise, Dumbledore continued to smile
[23641]8970    He looked down at Professor Trelawney, who was still sobbing and choking on her trunk, and said, You are quite right, of course, Professor Umbridge
[23642]753    As High Inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my teachers
[23643]490    You do not, however, have the authority to send them away from the castle
[23644]1824    I am afraid,' he went on, with a courteous little bow, that the power to do that still resides with the Headmaster, and it is my wish that Professor Trelawney continue to live at Hogwarts
[23645]1525   'At this, Professor Trelawney gave a wild little laugh in which a hiccough was barely hidden
[23646]1392   No-no, I'll g -go, Dumbledore
[23647]11079   I sh-shall-leave Hogwarts and s-seek my fortune elsewhere-'No,' said Dumbledore sharply
[23648]83    It is my wish that you remain, Sybill
[23649]1338   'He turned to Professor McGonagall
[23650]1175   Might I ask you to escort Sybill back upstairs, Professor McGonagall
[23651]5558  'Of course,' said McGonagall
[23652]11    Up you get, Sybill 
[23653]0   
[23654]0   
[23655]6926   'Professor Sprout came hurrying forwards out of the crowd and grabbed Professor Trelawney's other arm
[23656]831    Together, they guided her past Umbridge and up the marble stairs
[23657]1493    Professor Flitwick went scurrying after them, his wand held out before him; he squeaked Locomotor trunks
[23658]6675  ' and Professor Trelawney's luggage rose into the air and proceeded up the staircase after her, Professor Flitwick bringing up the rear
[23659]2658   Professor Umbridge was standing stock still, staring at Dumbledore, who continued to smile benignly
[23660]6092   And what,' she said, in a whisper that carried all around the Eintrance Hall, are you going to do with her once I appoint a new Divination teacher who needs her lodgings
[23661]8752  'Oh, that won't be a problem,' said Dumbledore pleasantly
[23662]633    You see, I have already found us a new Divination teacher, and he will prefer lodgings on the ground floor
[23663]693   'You've found- 
[23664]5667  ' said Umbridge shrilly
[23665]693    You've found
[23666]7720   Might I remind you, Dumbledore, that under Educational Decree Number Twenty-two-'The Ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate if-and only if-the Headmaster is unable to find one,' said Dumbledore
[23667]340    And I am happy to say that on this occasion I have succeeded
[23668]6    May I introduce you
[23669]1406  'He turned to face the open front doors, through which night mist was now drifting
[23670]6009    Harry heard hooves
[23671]642    There was a shocked murmur around the Hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved even further backwards, some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for the newcomer
[23672]8898   Through the mist came a face Harry had seen once before on a dark, dangerous night in the Forbidden Forest: white-blond hair and astonishingly blue eyes; the head and torso of a man joined to the palomino body of a horse
[23673]6565   This is Firenze,' said Dumbledore happily to a thunderstruck Umbridge
[23674]1134    I think you'll find him suitable

[23687]7727     I'll bet you wish you hadn't given up Divination now, don't you, Hermione
[23688]426  ' asked Parvati, smirking
[23689]2023   It was breakfast time, two days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon
[23690]212    They were to have their first lesson with Firenze that morning
[23691]7163   Not really,' said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet
[23692]1030   I've never really liked horses
[23693]407   'She turned a page of the newspaper and scanned its columns
[23694]9564   He's not a horse, he's a centaur
[23695]5183  ' said Lavender, sounding shocked
[23696]39   A gorgeous centaur 
[23697]0   
[23698]0   
[23699]79   ' sighed Parvati
[23700]12605   Either way, he's still got four legs,' said Hermione coolly
[23701]621    Anyway, I thought you two were all upset that Trelawney had gone
[23702]0  'We are
[23703]39  ' Lavender assured her
[23704]6176    We went up to her office to see her; we took her some daffodils -not the honking ones that Sprout's got, nice ones
[23705]0   ' How is she
[23706]6088  ' asked Harry
[23707]5680   Not very good, poor thing,' said Lavender sympathetically
[23708]7660    She was crying and saying she'd rather leave the castle for ever than stay here where Umbridge is, and I don't blame her, Umbridge was horrible to her, wasn't she
[23709]9826  'I've got a feeling Umbridge has only just started being horrible,' said Hermione darkly
[23710]7379   Impossible,' said Ron, who was tucking into a large plate of eggs and bacon
[23711]7114    She can't get any worse than she's been already
[23712]13481   'You mark my words, she's going to want revenge on Dumbledore for appointing a new teacher without consulting her,' said Hermione, closing the newspaper
[23713]47    Especially another part-human
[23714]1676    You saw the look on her face when she saw Firenze
[23715]10083   'After breakfast Hermione departed for her Arithmancy class as Harry and Ron followed Parvati and Lavender into the Entrance Hall, heading for Divination
[23716]2899   Aren't we going up to North Tower
[23717]3106  ' asked Ron, looking puzzled, as Parvati bypassed the marble staircase
[23718]840   Parvati looked at him scornfully over her shoulder
[23719]730   How d'you expect Firenze to climb that ladder
[23720]67   We're in classroom eleven now, it was on the noticeboard yesterday
[23721]1357   'Classroom eleven was on the ground floor along the corridor leading off the Entrance Hall from the opposite side to the Great Hall
[23722]6456    Harry knew it was one of those classrooms that were never used regularly, and therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or storeroom
[23723]2862    When he entered it right behind Ron, and found himself in the middle of a forest clearing, he was therefore momentarily stunned
[23724]0   What the-
[23725]1295  'The classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were growing out of it; their leafy branches fanned across the ceiling and windows, so that the room was full of slanting shafts of soft, dappled, green light
[23726]1535    The students who had already arrived were sitting on the earthy floor with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders, arms wrapped around their knees or folded tightly across their chests, and all looking rather nervous
[23727]362    In the middle of the clearing, where there were no trees, stood Firenze
[23728]17534   Harry Potter,' he said, holding out a hand when Harry entered
[23729]12597   Er-hi,' said Harry, shaking hands with the centaur, who surveyed him unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did not smile
[23730]6176    Er-good to see you,'And you,' said the centaur, inclining his white-blond head
[23731]54    It was foretold that we would meet again
[23732]10702   'Harry noticed there was the shadow of a hoof-shaped bruise on Firenze's chest
[23733]1862    As he turned to join the rest of the class on the ground, he saw they were all looking at him in awe, apparently deeply impressed that he was on speaking terms with Firenze
[23734]1    whom they seemed to find intimidating
[23735]1329   When the door was closed and the last student had sat down on a tree stump beside the wastepaper basket, Firenze gestured around the room
[23736]6803   Professor Dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us,' said Firenze, when everyone had settled down, in imitation of my natural habitat
[23737]270    I would have preferred to teach you in the Forbidden Forest, which was-until Monday-my home 
[23738]0   
[23739]0   
[23740]90    but that is no longer possible
[23741]5801   'Please-er- sir-' said Parvati breathlessly, raising her hand,-why not
[23742]1372   We've been in there with Hagrid, we're not frightened
[23743]5212  'It is not a question of your bravery,' said Firenze, but of my position
[23744]165    I cannot return to the Forest
[23745]13    My herd has banished me
[23746]8   'Herd
[23747]11778  ' said Lavender in a confused voice, and Harry knew she was thinking of cows
[23748]362    What- oh
[23749]534  'Comprehension dawned on her face
[23750]0    There are more of you
[23751]5106  ' she said, stunned
[23752]2084   Did Hagrid breed you, like the Thestrals
[23753]475  ' asked Dean eagerly
[23754]6696   Firenze turned his head very slowly to face Dean, who seemed to realise at once that he had said something very offensive
[23755]3472   I didn't-I meant-sorry,' he finished in a hushed voice
[23756]5327   Centaurs are not the servants or playthings of humans,' said Firenze quietly
[23757]552    There was a pause, then Parvati raised her hand again
[23758]143   Please, sir 
[23759]0   
[23760]0   
[23761]45    why have the other centaurs banished you
[23762]6820  'Because I have agreed to work for Professor Dumbledore,' said Firenze
[23763]88    They see this as a betrayal of our kind
[23764]12345   'Harry remembered how, nearly four years ago, the centaur Bane had shouted at Firenze for allowing Harry to ride to safety on his back; he had called him a common mule'
[23765]184    He wondered whether it had been Bane who had kicked Firenze in the chest
[23766]5462   Let us begin,' said Firenze
[23767]2752    He swished his long palomino tail, raised his hand towards the leafy canopy overhead, then lowered it slowly, and as he did so, the light in the room dimmed, so that they now seemed to be sitting in a forest clearing by twilight, and stars appeared on the ceiling
[23768]7111    There were oohs and gasps and Ron said audibly, Blimey
[23769]6002  'Lie back on the floor,' said Firenze in his calm voice, and observe the heavens
[23770]45    Here is written, for those who can see, the fortune of our races
[23771]5886   ' Harry stretched out on his back and gazed upwards at the ceiling
[23772]135    A twinkling red star winked at him from overhead
[23773]11339   I know that you have learned the names of the planets and their moons in Astronomy,' said Firenze's calm voice, and that you have mapped the stars' progress through the heavens
[23774]94    Centaurs have unravelled the mysteries of these movements over centuries
[23775]1607    Our findings teach us that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above us-'Professor Trelawney did astrology with us
[23776]5819  ' said Parvati excitedly, raising her hand in front of her so that it stuck up in the air as she lay on her back
[23777]8394    Mars causes accidents and burns and things like that, and when it makes an angle to Saturn, like now-' she drew a right-angle in the air above her -that means people need to be extra careful when handling hot things-' That,' said Firenze calmly, is human nonsense
[23778]5302   'Parvati's hand fell limply to her side
[23779]5537   Trivial hurts, tiny human accidents,' said Firenze, as his hooves thudded over the mossy floor
[23780]84    These are of no more significance than the scurryings of ants to the wide universe, and are unaffected by planetary movements
[23781]1607   'Professor Trelawney-' began Parvati, in a hurt and indignant voice
[23782]5213   -is a human,' said Firenze simply
[23783]90    And is therefore blinkered and fettered by the limitations of your kind
[23784]7222   'Harry turned his head very slightly to look at Parvati
[23785]1679    She looked very offended, as did several of the people surrounding her
[23786]8081   Sybill Trelawney may have Seen, I do not know,' continued Firenze, and Harry heard the swishing of his tail again as he walked up and down before them, but she wastes her time, in the main, on the self-flattering nonsense humans call fortune-telling
[23787]81    I, however, am here to explain the wisdom of centaurs, which is impersonal and impartial
[23788]396    We watch the skies for the great tides of evil or change that are sometimes marked there
[23789]439    It may take ten years to be sure of what we are seeing
[23790]5991   'Firenze pointed to the red star directly above Harry
[23791]229   In the past decade, the indications have been that wizardkind is living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars
[23792]198    Mars, bringer of battle, shines brightly above us, suggesting that the fight must soon break out again
[23793]251    How soon, centaurs may attempt to divine by the burning of certain herbs and leaves, by the observation of fume and flame 
[23794]0   
[23795]0   
[23796]5812   'It was the most unusual lesson Harry had ever attended
[23797]3514    They did indeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor, and Firenze told them to look for certain shapes and symbols in the pungent fumes, but he seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of them could see any of the signs he described, telling them that humans were hardly ever good at this, that it took centaurs years and years to become competent, and finished by telling them that it was foolish to put too much faith in such things, anyway, because even centaurs sometimes read them wrongly
[23798]6572    He was nothing like any human teacher Harry had ever had
[23799]1041    His priority did not seem to be to teach them what he knew, but rather to impress upon them that nothing, not even centaurs' knowledge, was foolproof
[23800]4755   He's not very definite on anything, is he
[23801]7716  ' said Ron in a low voice, as they put out their mallowsweet fire
[23802]2685    I mean, I could do with a few more details about this war we're about to have, couldn't you
[23803]8123  'The bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone jumped; Harry had completely forgotten they were still inside the castle, and quite convinced that he was really in the Forest
[23804]927    The class filed out, looking slightly perplexed
[23805]14297   Harry and Ron were on the point of following them when Firenze called, Harry Potter, a word, please
[23806]6064   'Harry turned
[23807]334    The centaur advanced a little towards him
[23808]2028    Ron hesitated
[23809]439   You may stay,' Firenze told him
[23810]596    But close the door, please
[23811]2011   'Ron hastened to obey
[23812]11656   Harry Potter, you are a friend of Hagrid's, are you not
[23813]5124  ' said the centaur
[23814]11110   Yes,' said Harry
[23815]29   Then give him a warning from me
[23816]74    His attempt is not working
[23817]189    He would do better to abandon it
[23818]74   'His attempt is not working
[23819]5807  ' Harry repeated blankly
[23820]5345   And he would do better to abandon it,' said Firenze, nodding
[23821]1530    I would warn Hagrid myself, but I am banished-it would be unwise for me to go too near the Forest now- Hagrid has troubles enough, without a centaurs' battle
[23822]5425   'But-what's Hagrid attempting to do
[23823]10859  ' said Harry nervously
[23824]5793   Firenze surveyed Harry impassively
[23825]6593   Hagrid has recently rendered me a great service,' said Firenze, and he has long since earned my respect for the care he shows all living creatures
[23826]39    I shall not betray his secret
[23827]45    But he must be brought to his senses
[23828]74    The attempt is not working
[23829]6525    Tell him, Harry Potter
[23830]504    Good-day to you
[23831]6431   'The happiness Harry had felt in the aftermath of The Quibbler interview had long since evaporated
[23832]503    As a dull March blurred into a squally April, his life seemed to have become one long series of worries and problems again
[23833]6482   Umbridge had continued attending all Care of Magical Creatures lessons, so it had been very difficult to deliver Firenze's warning to Hagrid
[23834]6846    At last, Harry had managed it by pretending he'd lost his copy of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and doubling back after class one day
[23835]7161    When he'd repeated Firenze's words, Hagrid gazed at him for a moment through his puffy, blackened eyes, apparently taken aback
[23836]25    Then he seemed to pull himself together
[23837]11389   Nice bloke, Firenze,' he said gruffly but he don' know what he's talkin' abou' on this
[23838]4831    The attemp's comin' on fine
[23839]652   'Hagrid, what're you up to
[23840]6121  ' asked Harry seriously
[23841]6961    Because you've got to be careful, Umbridge has already sacked Trelawney and, if you ask me, she's on a roll
[23842]13753    If you're doing anything you shouldn't be, you'll be-'There's things more importan' than keepin' a job,' said Hagrid
[23843]5793    though his hands shook slightly as he said this and a basin full of Knarl droppings crashed to the floor
[23844]11556    Don' worry abou' me, Harry, jus' get along now, there's a good lad
[23845]7249   'Harry had no choice but to leave Hagrid mopping up the dung all over his floor, but he felt thoroughly dispirited as he trudged back up to the castle
[23846]1816   Meanwhile, as the teachers and Hermione persisted in reminding them, the OWLs were drawing ever nearer
[23847]1162    All the fifth-years were suffering from stress to some degree, but Hannah Abbott became the first to receive a Calming Draught from Madam Pomfrey after she burst into tears during Herbology and sobbed that she was too stupid to take exams and wanted to leave school now
[23848]6250   If it had not been for the DA lessons, Harry thought he would have been extremely unhappy
[23849]3356    He sometimes felt he was living for the hours he spent in the Room of Requirement, working hard but thoroughly enjoying himself at the same time, swelling with pride as he looked around at his fellow DA members and saw how far they had come
[23850]7452    Indeed, Harry sometimes wondered how Umbridge was going to react when all the members of the DA received Outstanding' in their Defence Against the Dark Arts OWLs
[23851]7235   They had finally started work on Patronuses, which everybody had been very keen to practise, though, as Harry kept reminding them, producing a Patronus in the middle of a brightly lit classroom when they were not under threat was very different from producing it when confronted by something like a Dementor
[23852]9326   Oh, don't be such a killjoy,' said Cho brightly, watching her silvery swan-shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement during their last lesson before Easter
[23853]28    They're so pretty
[23854]11043  'They're not supposed to be pretty, they're supposed to protect you,' said Harry patiently
[23855]5626    What we really need is a boggart or something; that's how I learned, I had to conjure a Patronus while the boggart was pretending to be a Dementor-'But that would be really scary
[23856]5868  ' said Lavender, who was shooting puffs of silver vapour out of the end of her wand
[23857]2308    And I still-can't-do it
[23858]177  ' she added angrily
[23859]477   Neville was having trouble, too
[23860]1140    His face was screwed up in concentration, but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand tip
[23861]7751   You've got to think of something happy,' Harry reminded him
[23862]7237   I'm trying,' said Neville miserably, who was trying so hard his round face was actually shining with sweat
[23863]6917   Harry, I think I'm doing it
[23864]369  ' yelled Seamus, who had been brought along to his first ever DA meeting by Dean
[23865]5387    Look-ah-it's gone 
[23866]0   
[23867]0   
[23868]5773    but it was definitely something hairy, Harry
[23869]6516  'Hermione's Patronus, a shining silver otter, was gambolling around her
[23870]2487   They are sort of nice, aren't they
[23871]5698  ' she said, looking at it fondly
[23872]1227   The door of the Room of Requirement opened, and closed
[23873]7299    Harry looked round to see who had entered, but there did not seem to be anybody there
[23874]1066    It was a few moments before he realised that the people close to the door had fallen silent
[23875]681    Next thing he knew, something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee
[23876]1987    He looked down and saw, to his very great astonishment, Dobby the house-elf peering up at him from beneath his usual eight woolly hats
[23877]237   Hi, Dobby
[23878]5086  ' he said
[23879]4828    What are you-What's wrong
[23880]5517  'The elf's eyes were wide with terror and he was shaking
[23881]6731    The members of the DA closest to Harry had fallen silent; everybody in the room was watching Dobby
[23882]1965    The few Patronuses people had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist, leaving the room looking much darker than before
[23883]6336   Harry Potter, sir 
[23884]0   
[23885]0   
[23886]7043   ' squeaked the elf, trembling from head to foot, Harry Potter, sir 
[23887]0

[23889]658    Dobby has come to warn you 
[23890]0   
[23891]0   
[23892]589    but the house-elves have been warned not to tell 
[23893]0   
[23894]0   
[23895]689   'He ran head-first at the wall
[23896]11161    Harry, who had some experience of Dobby s habits of self-punishment, made to seize him, but Dobby merely bounced off the stone, cushioned by his eight hats
[23897]2009    Hermione and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy
[23898]5104   What's happened, Dobby
[23899]11619  ' Harry asked, grabbing the elf's tiny arm and holding him away from anything with which he might seek to hurt himself
[23900]6193   Harry Potter 
[23901]0   
[23902]0   
[23903]0    she

[23910]5796    Harry seized that, too
[23911]4961   Who's she", Dobby
[23912]940  'But he thought he knew; surely only one she' could induce such fear in Dobby
[23913]990   The elf looked up at him, slightly cross-eyed, and mouthed wordlessly
[23914]571   Umbridge
[23915]6106  ' asked Harry, horrified
[23916]11437   Dobby nodded, then tried to bang his head on Harry's knees
[23917]10668    Harry held him at arm's length
[23918]0   What about her
[23919]2610   Dobby-she hasn't found out about this-about us-about the DA
[23920]5574  'He read the answer in the elf's stricken face
[23921]6689    His hands held fast by Harry, the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor
[23922]106   Is she coming
[23923]6225  ' Harry asked quietly
[23924]1370   Dobby let out a howl, and began beating his bare feet hard on the floor
[23925]6777   Yes, Harry Potter, yes
[23926]6944  'Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf
[23927]84   WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR
[23928]5766  ' Harry bellowed
[23929]70    RUN
[23930]908  'They all pelted towards the exit at once, forming a scrum at the door, then people burst through
[23931]6690    Harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their dormitories
[23932]7272    It was only ten to nine; if they just took refuge in the library or the Owlery, which were both nearer-Harry, come on
[23933]2003  ' shrieked Hermione from the centre of the knot of people now fighting to get out
[23934]525   He scooped up Dobby, who was still attempting to do himself serious injury, and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the queue
[23935]792   Dobby-this is an order-get back down to the kitchen with the other elves and, if she asks you whether you warned me, lie and say no
[23936]10818  ' said Harry
[23937]63    And I forbid you to hurt yourself
[23938]756  ' he added, dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slammed the door behind him
[23939]6233   Thank you, Harry Potter
[23940]229  ' squeaked Dobby, and he streaked off
[23941]10263    Harry glanced left and right, the others were all moving so fast he caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor before they vanished; he started to run right; there was a boys' bathroom up ahead, he could pretend he'd been in there all the time if he could just reach it-AAARGH
[23942]637  Something caught him around the ankles and he fell spectacularly, skidding along on his front for six feet before coming to a halt
[23943]56    Someone behind him was laughing
[23944]942    He rolled over on to his, back and saw Malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly dragon-shaped vase
[23945]495   Trip Jinx, Potter
[23946]5086  ' he said
[23947]1528    Hey, Professor-PROFESSOR
[23948]1383   I've got one
[23949]1359  ' Umbridge came bustling round the far corner, breathless but wearing a delighted smile
[23950]4750   It's him
[23951]12266  ' she said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor, Excellent, Draco, excellent, oh, very good-fifty points to Slytherin
[23952]567   I'll take him from here 
[23953]0   
[23954]0   
[23955]528    stand up, Potter
[23956]6746  'Harry got to his feet, glaring at the pair of them
[23957]1413    He had never seen Umbridge looking so happy
[23958]1758    She seized his arm in a vice-like grip and turned, beaming broadly, to Malfoy
[23959]5273   You hop along and see if you can round up any more of them, Draco,' she said
[23960]8613    Tell the others to look in the library-anybody out of breath-check the bathrooms, Miss Parkinson can do the girls' ones-off you go-and you,' she added in her softest, most dangerous voice, as Malfoy walked away, you can come with me to the Headmaster's office, Potter
[23961]237   'They were at the stone gargoyle within minutes
[23962]5871    Harry wondered how many of the others had been caught
[23963]2759    He thought of Ron-Mrs
[23964]2567    Weasley would kill him-and of how Hermione would feel if she was expelled before she could take her OWLs
[23965]4896    And it had been Seamus's very first meeting 
[23966]0   
[23967]0   
[23968]762    and Neville had been getting so good 
[23969]0   
[23970]0   
[23971]1461   Fizzing Whizzbee,' sang Umbridge; the stone gargoyle jumped aside, the wall behind split open, and they ascended the moving stone staircase
[23972]8109    They reached the polished door with the griffin knocker, but Umbridge did not bother to knock, she strode straight inside, still holding tight to Harry
[23973]482   The office was full of people
[23974]1577    Dumbledore was sitting behind his desk, his expression serene, the tips of his long fingers together
[23975]1727    Professor McGonagall stood rigidly beside him, her face extremely tense
[23976]10941    Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic, was rocking backwards and forwards on his toes beside the fire, apparently immensely pleased with the situation; Kingsley Shacklebolt and a tough-looking wizard with very short wiry hair whom Harry did not recognise, were positioned either side of the door like guards, and the freckled, bespectacled form of Percy Weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall, a quill and a heavy scroll of parchment in his hands, apparently poised to take notes
[23977]319   The portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses were not shamming sleep tonight
[23978]182    All of them were alert and serious, watching what was happening below them
[23979]10788    As Harry entered, a few flitted into neighbouring frames and whispered urgently into their neighbour's ear
[23980]11933   Harry pulled himself free of Umbridge's grasp as the door swung shut behind them
[23981]886    Cornelius Fudge was glaring at him with a kind of vicious satisfaction on his face
[23982]5086   Well,' he said
[23983]0    Well, well, well 
[23984]0   
[23985]0   
[23986]6204   'Harry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster
[23987]481    His heart drummed madly inside him, but his brain was oddly cool and clear
[23988]5924   He was heading back to Gryffindor Tower,' said Umbridge
[23989]7794    There was an indecent excitement in her voice, the same callous pleasure Harry had heard as she watched Professor Trelawney dissolving with misery in the Entrance Hall
[23990]577    The Malfoy boy cornered him
[23991]1334   'Did he, did he
[23992]5286  ' said Fudge appreciatively
[23993]491    I must remember to tell Lucius
[23994]461    Well, Potter 
[23995]0   
[23996]0   
[23997]827    I expect you know why you are here
[23998]12965  'Harry fully intended to respond with a defiant yes': his mouth had opened and the word was half-formed when he caught sight of Dumbledore's face
[23999]15137    Dumbledore was not looking directly at Harry-his eyes were fixed on a point just over his shoulder-but as Harry stared at him, he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side
[24000]5889   Harry changed direction mid-word
[24001]2   Ye-no
[24002]16   'I beg your pardon
[24003]5283  ' said Fudge
[24004]10863   No,' said Harry, firmly
[24005]3712   You don't know why you are here
[24006]13759  'No, I don't,' said Harry
[24007]7941   Fudge looked incredulously from Harry to Professor Umbridge
[24008]7549    Harry took advantage of his momentary inattention to steal another quick look at Dumbledore, who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods and the shadow of a wink
[24009]7490   So you have no idea,' said Fudge, in a voice positively sagging with sarcasm, why Professor Umbridge has brought you to this office
[24010]308   You are not aware that you have broken any school rules
[24011]242  'School rules
[24012]10818  ' said Harry
[24013]0    No
[24014]222   'Or Ministry Decrees
[24015]282  ' amended Fudge angrily
[24016]11291   Not that I'm aware of,' said Harry blandly
[24017]184   His heart was still hammering very fast
[24018]2051    It was almost worth telling these lies to watch Fudges blood pressure rising, but he could not see how on earth he would get away with them; if somebody had tipped off Umbridge about the DA then he, the leader, might as well be packing his trunk right now
[24019]10949   So, it's news to you, is it,' said Fudge, his voice now thick with anger, that an illegal student organisation has been discovered within this school
[24020]12156  ' Yes, it is,' said Harry, hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise on to his face
[24021]6703   I think, Minister,' said Umbridge silkily from beside him, we might make better progress if I fetch our informant
[24022]8061   'Yes, yes, do,' said Fudge, nodding, and he glanced maliciously at Dumbledore as Umbridge left the room
[24023]6656    There's nothing like a good witness, is there, Dumbledore
[24024]6437  'Nothing at all, Cornelius,' said Dumbledore gravely, inclining his head
[24025]7611   There was a wait of several minutes, in which nobody looked at each other, then Harry heard the door open behind him
[24026]7142    Umbridge moved past him into the room, gripping by the shoulder Cho's curly-haired friend, Marietta, who was hiding her face in her hands
[24027]17996   Don't be scared, dear, don't be frightened,' said Professor Umbridge softly, patting her on the back, it's quite all right, now
[24028]742    You have done the right thing
[24029]123    The Minister is very pleased with you
[24030]1844    He'll be telling your mother what a good girl you've been
[24031]16624    Marietta's mother, Minister,' she added, looking up at Fudge, is Madam Edgecombe from the Department of Magical Transportation, Floo Network office- she's been helping us police the Hogwart's fires, you know
[24032]694   'Jolly good, jolly good
[24033]5294  ' said Fudge heartily
[24034]1589    Like mother, like daughter, eh
[24035]10579   Well, come on, now, dear, look up, don't be shy, let's hear what you've got to-galloping gargoyles
[24036]1121  'As Marietta raised her head, Fudge leapt backwards in shock, nearly landing himself in the fire
[24037]276    He cursed, and stamped on the hem of his cloak which had started to smoke
[24038]2969    Marietta gave a wail and pulled the neck of her robes right up to her eyes, but not before everyone had seen that her face was horribly disfigured by a series of close-set purple pustules that had spread across her nose and cheeks to form the word SNEAK'
[24039]8693   Never mind the spots now, dear,' said Umbridge impatiently, just take your robes away from your mouth and tell the Minister-'But Marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head frantically
[24040]1963   Oh, very well, you silly girl, I'll tell him,' snapped Umbridge
[24041]7251    She hitched her sickly smile back on to her face and said, Well, Minister, Miss Edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me
[24042]6372    She said that if I proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor, sometimes known as the Room of Requirement, I would find out something to my advantage
[24043]457    I questioned her a little further and she admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there
[24044]6798    Unfortunately, at that point this hex,' she waved impatiently at Marietta's concealed face, came into operation and upon catching sight of her face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more
[24045]7764   'Well, now,' said Fudge, fixing Marietta with what he evidently imagined was a kind and fatherly look, it is very brave of you, my dear, coming to tell Professor Umbridge
[24046]1510    You did exactly the right thing
[24047]543    Now, will you tell me what happened at this meeting
[24048]7   What was its purpose
[24049]0   Who was there
[24050]1273  'But Marietta would not speak; she merely shook her head again, her eyes wide and fearful
[24051]3175   Haven't we got a counter-jinx for this
[24052]6486  ' Fudge asked Umbridge impatiently, gesturing at Marietta's face
[24053]81    So she can speak freely
[24054]18137  'I have not yet managed to find one,' Umbridge admitted grudgingly, and Harry felt a surge of pride in Hermione's jinxing ability But it doesn't matter if she won't speak, I can take up the story from here
[24055]6353   You will remember, Minister, that I sent you a report back in October that Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hog's Head in Hogsmeade-' And what is your evidence for that
[24056]1048  ' cut in Professor McGonagall
[24057]744   I have testimony from Willy Widdershins, Minerva, who happened to be in the bar at the time
[24058]6014    He was heavily bandaged, it is true, but his hearing was quite unimpaired,' said Umbridge smugly
[24059]13837    He heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me-'Oh, so that's why he wasn't prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets
[24060]6168  ' said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows
[24061]30    What an interesting insight into our justice system
[24062]3  'Blatant corruption
[24063]6187  ' roared the portrait of the corpulent, red-nosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore's desk
[24064]1907    The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not
[24065]5990  'Thank you, Fortescue, that will do,' said Dumbledore softly
[24066]15222   The purpose of Potter's meeting with these students,' continued Professor Umbridge, was to persuade them to join an illegal society, whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school-age-'I think you'll find you're wrong there, Dolores,' said Dumbledore quietly, peering at her over the half-moon spectacles perched halfway down his crooked nose
[24067]5854   Harry stared at him
[24068]12185    He could not see how Dumbledore was going to talk him out of this one; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard every word he had said in the Hog's Head there was simply no escaping it
[24069]3   Oho
[24070]5548  ' said Fudge, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet again
[24071]6185    Yes, do let's hear the latest cock-and-bull story designed to pull Potter out of trouble
[24072]912   Go on, then, Dumbledore, go on-'Willy Widdershins was lying, was he
[24073]10647   Or was it Potter's identical twin in the Hog's Head that day
[24074]1248   Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time, a dead man coming back to life and a couple of invisible dementors
[24075]1141  'Percy Weasley let out a hearty laugh
[24076]1112   Oh, very good, Minister, very good
[24077]5758  'Harry could have kicked him
[24078]1240    Then he saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore was smiling gently, too
[24079]12389   Cornelius, I do not deny-and nor, I am sure, does Harry-that he was in the Hog's Head that day, nor that he was trying to recruit students to a Defence Against the Dark Arts group
[24080]1071    I am merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was, at that time, illegal
[24081]16359    If you remember, the Ministry Decree banning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after Harry's Hogsmeade meeting, so he was not breaking any rules at all in the Hog's Head
[24082]1384   'Percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something very heavy
[24083]729    Fudge remained motionless in mid-bounce, his mouth hanging open
[24084]576   Umbridge recovered first
[24085]10332   That's all very fine, Headmaster,' she said, smiling sweetly, but we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational Decree Number Twenty-four
[24086]260    If the first meeting was not illegal, all those that have happened since most certainly are
[24087]6374   'Well,' said Dumbledore, surveying her with polite interest over the top of his interlocked fingers, they certainly would be, if they had continued after the Decree came into effect
[24088]128    Do you have any evidence that any such meetings continued
[24089]7446  'As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather thought Kingsley whispered something
[24090]2038    He could have sworn, too, that he felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a draught or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there
[24091]17   Evidence
[24092]1601  ' repeated Umbridge, with that horrible wide toad-like smile
[24093]877    Have you not been listening, Dumbledore
[24094]639   Why do you think Miss Edgecombe is here
[24095]791  'Oh, can she tell us about six months' worth of meetings
[24096]5979  ' said Dumbledore, raising his eyebrows
[24097]189    I was under the impression that she was merely reporting a meeting tonight
[24098]7021   'Miss Edgecombe,' said Umbridge at once, tell us how long these meetings have been going on, dear
[24099]3939    You can simply nod or shake your head, I'm sure that won't make the spots worse
[24100]87    Have they been happening regularly over the last six months
[24101]6130  'Harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach
[24102]1431    This was it, they had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even Dumbledore would be able to shift aside
[24103]10015   Just nod or shake your head, dear,' Umbridge said coaxingly to Marietta, come on, now, that won't re-activate the jinx
[24104]5810   'Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta's face
[24105]846    Only her eyes were visible between the pulled-up robes and her curly fringe
[24106]1224    Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight, but her eyes looked oddly blank
[24107]11092    And then-to Harry's utter amazement-Marietta shook her head
[24108]1636   Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge, then back at Marietta
[24109]4340   I don't think you understood the question, did you, dear
[24110]1879   I'm asking whether you've been going to these meetings for the past six months
[24111]2438   You have, haven't you
[24112]593  'Again, Marietta shook her head
[24113]907   What do you mean by shaking your head, dear
[24114]6198  ' said Umbridge in a testy voice
[24115]7014   I would have thought her meaning was quite clear,' said Professor McGonagall harshly, there have been no secret meetings for the past six months
[24116]93    Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe
[24117]95  'Marietta nodded
[24118]112   But there was a meeting tonight
[24119]5706  ' said Umbridge furiously
[24120]924    There was a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, you told me about it, in the Room of Requirement
[24121]2039   And Potter was the leader, was he not, Potter organised it, Potter-why are you shaking your head, girl
[24122]6212  'Well, usually when a person shakes their head,' said McGonagall coldly, they mean no"
[24123]2896    So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of sign-language as yet unknown to humans-'Professor Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled her round to face her and began shaking her very hard
[24124]3169    A split second later Dumbledore was on his feet, his wand raised; Kingsley started forwards and Umbridge leapt back from Marietta, waving her hands in the air as though they had been burned
[24125]7391   I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores,' said Dumbledore and, for the first time, he looked angry
[24126]6802   You want to calm yourself, Madam Umbridge,' said Kingsley, in his deep, slow voice
[24127]3344    You don't want to get yourself into trouble, now
[24128]5789   'No,' said Umbridge breathlessly, glancing up at the towering figure of Kingsley
[24129]1117    I mean, yes-you're right, Shacklebolt-I-I forgot myself
[24130]870   ' Marietta was standing exactly where Umbridge had released her
[24131]6343    She seemed neither perturbed by Umbridge's sudden attack, nor relieved by her release; she was still clutching her robe up to her oddly blank eyes and staring straight ahead of her
[24132]16140   A sudden suspicion, connected to Kingsley's whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him, sprang into Harry's mind
[24133]13081   Dolores,' said Fudge, with the air of trying to settle something once and for all, the meeting tonight-the one we know definitely happened-'Yes,' said Umbridge, pulling herself together, yes 
[24134]0   
[24135]0   
[24136]824    well, Miss Edgecombe tipped me off and I proceeded at once to the seventh floor, accompanied by certain trustworthy students, so as to catch those in the meeting red-handed
[24137]545    It appears that they were forewarned of my arrival, however, because when we reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction
[24138]175    It does not matter, however
[24139]905    I have all their names here, Miss Parkinson ran into the Room of Requirement for me to see if they had left anything behind
[24140]501    We needed evidence and the room provided
[24141]16210   'And to Harry's horror, she withdrew from her pocket the list of names that had been pinned upon the Room of Requirement's wall and handed it to Fudge
[24142]11244   The moment I saw Potter's name on the list, I knew what we were dealing with,' she said softly
[24143]6015   Excellent,' said Fudge, a smile spreading across his face, excellent, Dolores
[24144]0    And 
[24145]0   
[24146]0   
[24147]4    by thunder 
[24148]0   
[24149]0   
[24150]2507   'He looked up at Dumbledore, who was still standing beside Marietta, his wand held loosely in his hand
[24151]716   See what they've named themselves
[24152]5420  ' said Fudge quietly
[24153]5580    Dumbledore's Army
[24154]1515   'Dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from Fudge
[24155]2102    He gazed at the heading scribbled by Hermione months before and for a moment seemed unable to speak
[24156]742    Then he looked up, smiling
[24157]5145   Well, the game is up,' he said simply
[24158]830    Would you like a written confession from me, Cornelius -or will a statement before these witnesses suffice
[24159]6814  'Harry saw McGonagall and Kingsley look at each other
[24160]75    There was fear in both faces
[24161]2167    He did not understand what was going on, and nor, apparently, did Fudge
[24162]6   Statement
[24163]5409  ' said Fudge slowly
[24164]2941    What-I don't-
[24165]17138  'Dumbledore's Army, Cornelius,' said Dumbledore, still smiling as he waved the list of names before Fudge's face
[24166]5224    Not Potter's Army
[24167]5580    Dumbledore's Army
[24168]5586   'But-but-'Understanding blazed suddenly in Fudge's face
[24169]367    He took a horrified step backwards, yelped, and jumped out of the fire again
[24170]0   You
[24171]215  ' he whispered, stamping again on his smouldering cloak
[24172]11223   That's right,' said Dumbledore pleasantly
[24173]2   You organised this
[24174]6570  'I did,' said Dumbledore
[24175]161   You recruited these students for-for your army
[24176]6131  'Tonight was supposed to be the first meeting,' said Dumbledore, nodding
[24177]78    Merely to see whether they would be interested in joining me
[24178]322    I see now that it was a mistake to invite Miss Edgecombe, of course
[24179]95   'Marietta nodded
[24180]1760    Fudge looked from her to Dumbledore, his chest swelling
[24181]5   Then you have been plotting against me
[24182]79  ' he yelled
[24183]11219   That's right,' said Dumbledore cheerfully
[24184]0   NO
[24185]5867  ' shouted Harry
[24186]8316   Kingsley flashed a look of warning at him, McGonagall widened her eyes threateningly, but it had suddenly dawned on Harry what Dumbledore was about to do, and he could not let it happen
[24187]1568   No-Professor Dumbledore-
[24188]12037  'Be quiet, Harry, or I am afraid you will have to leave my office,' said Dumbledore calmly
[24189]858   Yes, shut up, Potter
[24190]1143  ' barked Fudge, who was still ogling Dumbledore with a kind of horrified delight
[24191]6878    Well, well, well-I came here tonight expecting to expel Potter and instead-'Instead you get to arrest me,' said Dumbledore, smiling
[24192]7950    It's like losing a Knut and finding a Galleon, isn't it
[24193]636  'Weasley
[24194]11480  ' cried Fudge, now positively quivering with delight, Weasley, have you written it all down, everything he's said, his confession, have you got it
[24195]1140  ' Yes, sir, I think so, sir
[24196]5623  ' said Percy eagerly, whose nose was splattered with ink from the speed of his note-taking
[24197]10201   The bit about how he's been trying to build up an army against the Ministry, how he's been working to destabilise me
[24198]2110  'Yes, sir, I've got it, yes
[24199]5252  ' said Percy, scanning his notes joyfully
[24200]6118   Very well, then,' said Fudge, now radiant with glee, duplicate your notes, Weasley, and send a copy to the Daily Prophet at once
[24201]508    If we send a fast owl we should make the morning edition
[24202]2444  ' Percy dashed from the room, slamming the door behind him, and Fudge turned back to Dumbledore
[24203]374    You will now be escorted back to the Ministry, where you will be formally charged, then sent to Azkaban to await trial
[24204]6272  'Ah,' said Dumbledore gently, yes
[24205]1068    Yes, I thought we might hit that little snag
[24206]3   'Snag
[24207]5832  ' said Fudge, his voice still vibrating with joy
[24208]820    I see no snag, Dumbledore
[24209]6389  'Well,' said Dumbledore apologetically, I'm afraid I do
[24210]650   'Oh, really
[24211]6053  'Well-it's just that you seem to be labouring under the delusion that I am going to-what is the phrase
[24212]573  -come quietly
[24213]1138   I am afraid I am not going to come quietly at all, Cornelius
[24214]153    I have absolutely no intention of being sent to Azkaban
[24215]1704    I could break out, of course-but what a waste of time, and frankly, I can think of a whole host of things I would rather be doing
[24216]6667   'Umbridge's face was growing steadily redder; she looked as though she was being filled with boiling water
[24217]3040    Fudge stared at Dumbledore with a very silly expression on his face, as though he had just been stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had happened
[24218]2154    He made a small choking noise, then looked round at Kingsley and the man with short grey hair, who alone of everyone in the room had remained entirely silent so far
[24219]1354    The latter gave Fudge a reassuring nod and moved forwards a little, away from the wall
[24220]6471    Harry saw his hand drift, almost casually, towards his pocket
[24221]8888   Don't be silly, Dawlish,' said Dumbledore kindly
[24222]1142    I'm sure you are an excellent Auror-I seem to remember that you achieved Outstanding in all your NEWTs-but if you attempt to-er-bring me in by force, I will have to hurt you
[24223]265   'The man called Dawlish blinked rather foolishly
[24224]1472    He looked towards Fudge again, but this time seemed to be hoping for a clue as to what to do next
[24225]1163   So,' sneered Fudge, recovering himself, you intend to take on Dawlish, Shacklebolt, Dolores and myself single-handed, do you, Dumbledore
[24226]10839  'Merlin's beard, no,' said Dumbledore, smiling, not unless you are foolish enough to force me to
[24227]74   'He will not be single-handed
[24228]6941  ' said Professor McGonagall loudly, plunging her hand inside her robes
[24229]674   Oh yes he will, Minerva
[24230]5958  ' said Dumbledore sharply
[24231]257    Hogwarts needs you
[24232]28  ' Enough of this rubbish
[24233]5766  ' said Fudge, pulling out his own wand
[24234]9    Dawlish
[24235]16   Shacklebolt
[24236]0   Take him
[24237]13822  'A streak of silver light flashed around the room; there was a bang like a gunshot and the floor trembled; a hand grabbed the scruff of Harry's neck and forced him down on the floor as a second silver flash went off; several of the portraits yelled, Fawkes screeched and a cloud of dust filled the air
[24238]6700    Coughing in the dust, Harry saw a dark figure fall to the ground with a crash in front of him; there was a shriek and a thud and somebody cried, No
[24239]295  '; then there was the sound of breaking glass, frantically scuffling footsteps, a groan 
[24240]0   
[24241]0   
[24242]82    and silence
[24243]12455   Harry struggled around to see who was half-strangling him and saw Professor McGonagall crouched beside him; she had forced both him and Marietta out of harm's way
[24244]218    Dust was still floating gently down through the air on to them
[24245]6397    Panting slightly, Harry saw a very tall figure moving towards them
[24246]557   Are you all right
[24247]1173  ' Dumbledore asked
[24248]292   Yes
[24249]11989  ' said Professor McGonagall, getting up and dragging Harry and Marietta with her
[24250]41   The dust was clearing
[24251]6393    The wreckage of the office loomed into view: Dumbledore's desk had been overturned, all of the spindly tables had been knocked to the floor, their silver instruments in pieces
[24252]1183    Fudge, Umbridge, Kingsley and Dawlish lay motionless on the floor
[24253]294    Fawkes the phoenix soared in wide circles above them, singing softly
[24254]7291   Unfortunately, I had to hex Kingsley too, or it would have looked very suspicious,' said Dumbledore in a low voice
[24255]9113    He was remarkably quick on the uptake, modifying Miss Edgecombe's memory like that while everyone was looking the other way- thank him, for me, won't you, Minerva
[24256]3338  Now, they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do not know that we had time to communicate-you must act as though no time has passed, as though they were merely knocked to the ground, they will not remember-'Where will you go, Dumbledore
[24257]1129  ' whispered Professor McGonagall
[24258]219    Grimmauld Place
[24259]6474  'Oh no,' said Dumbledore, with a grim smile, I am not leaving to go into hiding
[24260]1202    Fudge will soon wish he'd never dislodged me from Hogwarts, I promise you
[24261]1568   'Professor Dumbledore 
[24262]0   
[24263]0   
[24264]5853   ' Harry began
[24265]3488   He did not know what to say first: how sorry he was that he had started the DA in the first place and caused all this trouble, or how terrible he felt that Dumbledore was leaving to save him from expulsion
[24266]1208   But Dumbledore cut him off before he could say another word
[24267]10916   Listen to me, Harry,' he said urgently
[24268]322    You must study Occlumency as hard as you can, do you understand me
[24269]2313   Do everything Professor Snape tells you and practise it particularly every night before sleeping so that you can close your mind to bad dreams-you will understand why soon enough, but you must promise me-'The man called Dawlish was stirring
[24270]11374    Dumbledore seized Harry's wrist
[24271]19116   Remember-close your mind-'But as Dumbledore's fingers closed over Harry's skin, a pain shot through the scar on his forehead and he felt again that terrible, snakelike longing to strike Dumbledore, to bite him, to hurt him--you will understand,' whispered Dumbledore
[24272]321   Fawkes circled the office and swooped low over him
[24273]12310    Dumbledore released Harry, raised his hand and grasped the phoenix's long golden tail
[24274]199    There was a flash of fire and the pair of them were gone
[24275]0   Where is he
[24276]564  ' yelled Fudge, pushing himself up from the floor
[24277]0    Where is he
[24278]3712  'I don't know
[24279]438  ' shouted Kingsley, also leaping to his feet
[24280]2312   Well, he can't have Disapparated
[24281]611  ' cried Umbridge
[24282]2805    You can't do it from inside this school- 'The stairs
[24283]1673  ' cried Dawlish, and he flung himself upon the door, wrenched it open and disappeared, followed closely by Kingsley and Umbridge
[24284]1303    Fudge hesitated, then got slowly to his feet, brushing dust from his front
[24285]451    There was a long and painful silence
[24286]6900   Well, Minerva,' said Fudge nastily, straightening his torn shirtsleeve, I'm afraid this is the end of your friend Dumbledore
[24287]562   'You think so, do you
[24288]6095  ' said Professor McGonagall scornfully
[24289]386   Fudge seemed not to hear her
[24290]777    He was looking around at the wrecked office
[24291]426    A few of the portraits hissed at him; one or two even made rude hand gestures
[24292]13658   You'd better get those two off to bed,' said Fudge, looking back at Professor McGonagall with a dismissive nod towards Harry and Marietta
[24293]12384   Professor McGonagall said nothing, but marched Harry and Marietta to the door
[24294]11492    As it swung closed behind them, Harry heard Phineas Nigellus's voice
[24295]1659   You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts

[24320]5961    Lionfish 11/Nov/2007     Chapter Twenty-eight     Snape's Worst MemoryContents  Prev Chapter  Next Chapter  
[24321]3118     BY ORDER OF THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC Dolores Jane Umbridge (High Inquisitor) has replacedAlbus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School ofWitchcraft and Wizardry
[24322]118    The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty-eight
[24323]3690    Signed: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister for MagicThe notices had gone up all around the school overnight, but they did not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that Dumbledore had overcome two Aurors, the High Inquisitor, the Minister for Magic and his Junior Assistant to escape
[24324]18369    No matter where Harry went within the castle, the sole topic of conversation was Dumbledore's flight, and though some of the details may have gone awry in the retelling (Harry overheard one second-year girl assuring another that Fudge was now lying in St
[24325]5440    Mungo's with a pumpkin for a head) it was surprising how accurate the rest of their information was
[24326]18260    Everybody knew, for instance, that Harry and Marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in Dumbledore's office and, as Marietta was now in the hospital wing, Harry found himself besieged with requests to give a first-hand account
[24327]17333   Dumbledore will be back before long,' said Ernie Macmillan confidently on the way back from Herbology, after listening intently to Harry's story
[24328]6246    They couldn't keep him away in our second year and they won't be able to this time
[24329]12407    The Fat Friar told me-' he dropped his voice conspiratorially, so that Harry, Ron and Hermione had to lean closer to him to hear -that Umbridge tried to get back into his office last night after they'd searched the castle and grounds for him
[24330]2603    Couldn't get past the gargoyle
[24331]5422    The Head's office has sealed itself against her
[24332]80   ' Ernie smirked
[24333]906    Apparently, she had a right little tantrum
[24334]13566   ' Oh, I expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the Head's office,' said Hermione viciously, as they walked up the stone steps into the Entrance Hall
[24335]1077    Lording it over all the other teachers, the stupid puffed-up, power-crazy old-'Now, do you really want to finish that sentence, Granger
[24336]1388  'Draco Malfoy had slid out from behind the door, closely followed by Crabbe and Goyle
[24337]681    His pale, pointed face was alight w th malice
[24338]1063   Afraid I'm going to have to dock a few points from Gryffincor and Hufflepuff,' he drawled
[24339]10476   It's only teachers who can dock points from houses, Malfoy,' said Ernie at once
[24340]398   Yeah, we're prefects, too, remember
[24341]2039  ' snarled Ron
[24342]3205   I know prefects can't dock points, Weasel King,' sneered Maltby
[24343]167    Crabbe and Goyle sniggered
[24344]60    But members of the Inquisitorial Squad-'The what
[24345]6756  ' said Hermione sharply
[24346]11710   The Inquisitorial Squad, Granger,' said Malfoy, pointing towards a tiny silver I' on his robes just beneath his prefect's badge
[24347]2336    A select group of students who are supportive of the Ministry of Magic, hand-picked by Professor Umbridge
[24348]157    Anyway, members of the Inquisitorial Squad do have the power to dock points 
[24349]0   
[24350]0   
[24351]783    so, Granger, I'll have five from you for being rude about our new Headmistress
[24352]17    Macmillan, five for contradicting me
[24353]4136    Five because I don't like you, Potter
[24354]5964    Weasley, your shirt's untucked, so I'll have another five for that
[24355]721    Oh yeah, I forgot, you're a Mudblood, Granger, so ten off for that
[24356]7552   'Ron pulled out his wand, but Hermione pushed it away, whispering, Don't
[24357]516  ' Wise move, Granger,' breathed Malfoy
[24358]841    New Head, new times 
[24359]0   
[24360]0   
[24361]349    be good now, Potty 
[24362]0   
[24363]0   
[24364]42    Weasel King 
[24365]0   
[24366]0   
[24367]613   'Laughing heartily, he strode away with Crabbe and Goyle
[24368]5768   He was bluffing,' said Ernie, looking appalled
[24369]2408    He can't be allowed to dock points 
[24370]0   
[24371]0   
[24372]11    that would be ridiculous 
[24373]0   
[24374]0   
[24375]124    it would completely undermine the prefect system
[24376]10428   'But Harry, Ron and Hermione had turned automatically towards the giant hour-glasses set in niches along the wall behind them, which recorded the house-points
[24377]474    Gryffindor and Ravenclaw had been neck and neck in the lead that morning
[24378]210    Even as they watched, stones flew upwards, reducing the amounts in the lower bulbs
[24379]376    In fact, the only glass that seemed unchanged was the emerald-filled one of Slytherin
[24380]73   Noticed, have you
[24381]10803  ' said Fred's voice
[24382]11297   He and George had just come down the marble staircase and joined Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ernie in front of the hour-glasses
[24383]12726   Malfoy just docked us all about fifty points,' said Harry furiously, as they watched several more stones fly upwards from the Gryffindor hour-glass
[24384]5934   Yeah, Montague tried to do us during break,' said George
[24385]359   What do you mean, tried"
[24386]7243  ' said Ron quickly
[24387]6603   He never managed to get all the words out,' said Fred, due to the fact that we forced him head-first into that Vanishing Cabinet on the first floor
[24388]2318   'Hermione looked very shocked
[24389]674   But you'll get into terrible trouble
[24390]5727  'Not until Montague reappears, and that could take weeks, I dunno where we sent him,' said Fred coolly
[24391]0    Anyway 
[24392]0   
[24393]0   
[24394]3930    we've decided we don't care about getting into trouble any more
[24395]0   'Have you ever
[24396]1971  ' asked Hermione
[24397]5681   Course we have,' said George
[24398]43    Never been expelled, have we
[24399]6310  'We've always known where to draw the line,' said Fred
[24400]5486   We might have put a toe across it occasionally,' said George
[24401]6481   But we've always stopped short of causing real mayhem,' said Fred
[24402]0   But now
[24403]7100  ' said Ron tentatively
[24404]5464   Well, now-' said George
[24405]6460   -what with Dumbledore gone-' said Fred
[24406]5713   -we reckon a bit of mayhem-' said George
[24407]6339   -is exactly what our dear new Head deserves,' said Fred
[24408]2316   You mustn't
[24409]1738  ' whispered Hermione
[24410]2604    You really mustn't
[24411]695   She'd love a reason to expel you
[24412]4556  'You don't get it, Hermione, do you
[24413]5580  ' said Fred, smiling at her
[24414]3036    We don't care about staying any more
[24415]4627    We'd walk out right now if we weren't determined to do our bit for Dumbledore first
[24416]108    So, anyway,' he checked his watch, phase one is about to begin
[24417]3830    I'd get in the Great Hall for lunch, if I were you, that way the teachers will see you can't have had anything to do with it
[24418]0   'Anything to do with what
[24419]6736  ' said Hermione anxiously
[24420]6031   You'll see,' said George
[24421]70    Run along, now
[24422]1735   'Fred and George turned away and disappeared into the swelling crowd descending the stairs towards lunch
[24423]1268    Looking highly disconcerted, Ernie muttered something about unfinished Transfiguration homework and scurried away
[24424]8075   I think we should get out of here, you know,' said Hermione nervously
[24425]871    Just in case 
[24426]0   
[24427]0   
[24428]20057   ' Yeah, all right,' said Ron, and the three of them moved towards the doors to the Great Hall, but Harry had barely glimpsed the day's ceiling of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoulder and, turning, he found himself almost nose-to-nose with Filch the caretaker
[24429]553    He took several hasty steps backwards; Filch was best viewed at a distance
[24430]1211   The Headmistress would like to see you, Potter,' he leered
[24431]14454   I didn't do it,' said Harry stupidly, thinking of whatever Fred and George were planning
[24432]4978    Filch's jowls wobbled with silent laughter
[24433]53   Guilty conscience, eh
[24434]4  ' he wheezed
[24435]34    Follow me
[24436]10060   'Harry glanced back at Ron and Hermione, who were both looking worried
[24437]682    He shrugged, and followed Filch back into the Entrance Hall, against the tide of hungry students
[24438]714   Filch seemed to be in an extremely good mood; he hummed creakily under his breath as they climbed the marble staircase
[24439]5863    As they reached the first landing he said, Things are changing around here, Potter
[24440]11616   'I've noticed,' said Harry coldly
[24441]1   Yerse 
[24442]0   
[24443]0   
[24444]11922    I've been telling Dumbledore for years and years he's too soft with you all,' said Filch, chuckling nastily
[24445]1116    You filthy little beasts would never have dropped Stink Pellets if you'd known I had it in my power to whip you raw, would you, now
[24446]1357   Nobody would have thought of throwing Fanged Frisbees down the corridors if I could've strung you up by the ankles in my office, would they
[24447]1338   But when Educational Decree Number Twenty-nine comes in, Potter, I'll be allowed to do them things 
[24448]0   
[24449]0   
[24450]5453    and she's asked the Minister to sign an order for the expulsion of Peeves 
[24451]0   
[24452]0   
[24453]1042    oh, things are going to be very different around here with her in charge 
[24454]0   
[24455]0   
[24456]13145   'Umbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get Filch on her side, Harry thought, and the worst of it was that he would probably prove an important weapon; his knowledge of the school's secret passageways and hiding places was probably second only to that of the Weasley twins
[24457]17764   Here we are,' he said, leering down at Harry as he rapped three times on Professor Umbridge's door and pushed it open
[24458]595    The Potter boy to see you, Ma'am
[24459]12009   'Umbridge's office, so very familiar to Harry from his many detentions, was the same as usual except for the large wooden block lying across the front of her desk on which golden letters spelled the word: HEADMISTRESS
[24460]6204    Also, his Firebolt and Fred and George's Cleansweeps, which he saw with a pang, were chained and padlocked to a stout iron peg in the wall behind the desk
[24461]1812   Umbridge was sitting behind the desk, busily scribbling on some of her pink parchment, but she looked up and smiled widely at their entrance
[24462]5153   Thank you, Argus,' she said sweetly
[24463]5345   Not at all, Ma'am, not at all,' said Filch, bowing as low as his rheumatism would permit, and exiting backwards
[24464]5921   Sit,' said Umbridge curtly, pointing towards a chair
[24465]5865    Harry sat
[24466]120    She continued to scribble for a few moments
[24467]727    He watched some of the foul kittens gambolling around the plates over her head, wondering what fresh horror she had in store for him
[24468]6080   Well, now,' she said finally, setting down her quill and surveying him complacently, like a toad about to swallow a particularly juicy fly
[24469]762    What would you like to drink
[24470]0  'What
[24471]11235   said Harry, quite sure he had misheard her
[24472]6031   To drink, Mr Potter,' she said, smiling still more widely
[24473]37    Tea
[24474]7   Coffee
[24475]30   Pumpkin juice
[24476]1130  'As she named each drink, she gave her short wand a wave, and a cup or glass of it appeared on her desk
[24477]10858   Nothing, thank you,' said Harry
[24478]5725   I wish you to have a drink with me,' she said, her voice becoming dangerously sweet
[24479]13    Choose one
[24480]75   'Fine 
[24481]0   
[24482]0   
[24483]10870    tea then,' said Harry shrugging
[24484]899   She got up and made quite a performance of adding milk with her back to him
[24485]232    She then bustled around the desk with it, smiling in a sinisterly sweet fashion
[24486]5107   There,' she said, handing it to him
[24487]2597    Drink it before it gets cold, won't you
[24488]833   Well, now, Mr Potter 
[24489]0   
[24490]0   
[24491]948    I thought we ought to have a little chat, after the distressing events of last night
[24492]5086   'He said nothing
[24493]118    She settled herself back into her seat and waited
[24494]5675    When several long moments had passed in silence, she said gaily, You're not drinking up
[24495]1121  'He raised the cup to his lips and then, just as suddenly, lowered it
[24496]21425    One of the horrible painted kittens behind Umbridge had great round blue eyes just like Mad-Eye Moody's magical one and it had just occurred to Harry what Mad-Eye would say if he ever heard that Harry had drunk anything offered by a known enemy
[24497]4836   What's the matter
[24498]5855  ' said Umbridge, who was still watching him closely
[24499]341    Do you want sugar
[24500]10818  'No,' said Harry
[24501]562   He raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip, though keeping his mouth tightly closed
[24502]5429    Umbridge's smile widened
[24503]466   Good,' she whispered
[24504]343    Very good
[24505]0    Now then 
[24506]0   
[24507]0   
[24508]387   ' She leaned forwards a little
[24509]838    Where is Albus Dumbledore
[24510]10941  'No idea,' said Harry promptly
[24511]5208   Drink up, drink up,' she said, still smiling
[24512]372    Now, Mr
[24513]817    Potter, let us not play childish games
[24514]1671    I know that you know where he has gone
[24515]826    You and Dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning
[24516]406    Consider your position, Mr
[24517]461    Potter 
[24518]0   
[24519]0   
[24520]9497   'I don't know where he is,' Harry repeated
[24521]40   He pretended to drink again
[24522]198    She was watching him very closely
[24523]5764   Very well,' she said, though she looked displeased
[24524]1304    In that case, you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black
[24525]11402   'Harry's stomach turned over and his hand holding the teacup shook so that it rattled in its saucer
[24526]482    He tilted the cup to his mouth with his lips pressed together, so that some of the hot liquid trickled down on to his robes
[24527]9242   I don't know,' he said, a little too quickly
[24528]372   Mr
[24529]6992    Potter,' said Umbridge, let me remind you that it was I who almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October
[24530]1186    I know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if I had had any proof neither of you would be at large today, I promise you
[24531]380    I repeat, Mr
[24532]461    Potter 
[24533]0   
[24534]0   
[24535]885    where is Sirius Black
[24536]11065  'No idea,' said Harry loudly
[24537]3147    Haven't got a clue
[24538]6973   'They stared at each other so long that Harry felt his eyes watering
[24539]727    Then Umbridge stood up
[24540]1360   Very well, Potter, I will take your word for it this time, but be warned: the might of the Ministry stands behind me
[24541]232    All channels of communication in and out of this school are being monitored
[24542]608    A Floo Network Regulator is keeping watch over every fire in Hogwarts-except my own, of course
[24543]406    My Inquisitorial Squad is opening and reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle
[24544]372    And Mr
[24545]269    Filch is observing all secret passages in and out of the castle
[24546]19    If I find a shred of evidence 
[24547]0   
[24548]0   
[24549]1   'BOOM
[24550]506  The very floor of the office shook
[24551]1488    Umbridge slipped sideways, clutching her desk for support, and looking shocked
[24552]0   What was-
[24553]555  'She was gazing towards the door
[24554]6081    Harry took the opportunity to empty his almost-full cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers
[24555]587    He could hear people running and screaming several floors below
[24556]493   Back to lunch you go, Potter
[24557]1228  ' cried Umbridge, raising her wand and dashing out of the office
[24558]6200    Harry gave her a few seconds' start, then hurried after her to see what the source of all the uproar was
[24559]49   It was not difficult to find
[24560]273    One floor down, pandemonium reigned
[24561]6112    Somebody (and Harry had a very shrewd idea who) had set off what seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted fireworks
[24562]10143   Dragons comprised entirely of green and gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors, emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went; shocking-pink Catherine wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers; rockets with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls; sparklers were writing swear words in midair of their own accord; firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere Harry looked, and instead of burning themselves out, fading from sight or fizzling to a halt, these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he watched
[24563]1043   Filch and Umbridge were standing, apparently transfixed in horror, halfway down the stairs
[24564]7048    As Harry watched, one of the larger Catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more room to manoeuvre; it whirled towards Umbridge and Filch with a sinister wheeeeeeeeee'
[24565]449    They both yelled with fright and ducked, and it soared straight out of the window behind them and off across the grounds
[24566]2053    Meanwhile, several of the dragons and a large purple bat that was smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end of the corridor to escape towards the second floor
[24567]181   Hurry, Filch, hurry
[24568]1436  ' shrieked Umbridge, they'll be all over the school unless we do something-Stupefy
[24569]1032  'A jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the rockets
[24570]3639    Instead of freezing in midair, it exploded with such force that it blasted a hole in a painting of a soppy-looking witch in the middle of a meadow; she ran for it just in time, reappearing seconds later squashed into the next painting, where a couple of wizards playing cards stood up hastily to make room for her
[24571]3057   Don't Stun them, Filch
[24572]852  ' shouted Umbridge angrily, for all the world as though it had been his incantation
[24573]571   Right you are, Headmistress
[24574]179  ' wheezed Filch, who as a Squib could no more have Stunned the fireworks than swallowed them
[24575]1086    He dashed to a nearby cupboard, pulled out a broom and began swatting at the fireworks in midair; within seconds the head of the broom was ablaze
[24576]14907   Harry had seen enough; laughing, he ducked down low, ran to a door he knew was concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the corridor and slipped through it to find Fred and George hiding just behind it, listening to Umbridge and Filch's yells and quaking with suppressed mirth
[24577]11010   Impressive,' Harry said quietly, grinning
[24578]12    Very impressive 
[24579]0   
[24580]0   
[24581]570    you'll put Dr
[24582]75    Filibuster out of business, no problem 
[24583]0   
[24584]0   
[24585]1152   'Cheers,' whispered George, wiping tears of laughter from his face
[24586]447    Oh, I hope she tries Vanishing them next 
[24587]0   
[24588]0   
[24589]644    they multiply by ten every time you try
[24590]397   ' The fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school that afternoon
[24591]3005    Though they caused plenty of disruption, particularly the firecrackers, the other teachers didn't seem to mind them very much
[24592]6470   Dear, dear,' said Professor McGonagall sardonically, as one of the dragons soared around her classroom, emitting loud bangs and exhaling flame
[24593]398    Miss Brown, would you mind running along to the Headmistress and informing her that we have an escaped firework in our classroom
[24594]1957  'The upshot of it all was that Professor Umbridge spent her first afternoon as Headmistress running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers, none of whom seemed able to rid their rooms of the fireworks without her
[24595]12700    When the final bell rang and they were heading back to Gryffindor Tower with their bags, Harry saw, with immense satisfaction, a dishevelled and soot-blackened Umbridge tottering sweaty-faced from Professor Flitwick's classroom
[24596]791   Thank you so much, Professor
[24597]6703  ' said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice
[24598]3630    I could have got rid of the sparklers myself, of course, but I wasn't sure whether or not I had the authority
[24599]1210   'Beaming, he closed his classroom door in her snarling face
[24600]1736   Fred and George were heroes that night in the Gryffindor common room
[24601]2093    Even Hermione fought her way through the excited crowd to congratulate them
[24602]5126   They were wonderful fireworks,' she said admiringly
[24603]6210   Thanks,' said George, looking both surprised and pleased
[24604]55    Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-bangs
[24605]828    Only thing is, we used our whole stock; we're going to have to start again from scratch now
[24606]5708   'It was worth it, though,' said Fred, who was taking orders from clamouring Gryffindors
[24607]6897    If you want to add your name to the waiting list, Hermione, it's five Galleons for your Basic Blaze box and twenty for the Deflagration Deluxe 
[24608]0   
[24609]0   
[24610]10273   'Hermione returned to the table where Harry and Ron were sitting staring at their schoolbags as though hoping their homework would spring out and start doing itself
[24611]3493   Oh, why don't we have a night off
[24612]7812  ' said Hermione brightly, as a silver-tailed Weasley rocket zoomed past the window
[24613]1278    After all, the Easter holidays start on Friday, we'll have plenty of time then
[24614]725   'Are you feeling all right
[24615]2542  ' Ron asked, staring at her in disbelief
[24616]8170   Now you mention it,' said Hermione happily, d'you know 
[24617]0   
[24618]0   
[24619]1365    I think I'm feeling a bit 
[24620]0   
[24621]0   
[24622]2    rebellious
[24623]9559   'Harry could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when he and Ron went up to bed an hour later; and as he got undressed a sparkler floated past the tower, still resolutely spelling out the word POO'
[24624]879   He got into bed, yawning
[24625]1938    With his glasses off, the occasional firework passing the window had become blurred, looking like sparkling clouds, beautiful and mysterious against the black sky
[24626]7813    He turned on to his side, wondering how Umbridge was feeling about her first day in Dumbledore's job, and how Fudge would react when he heard that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced disruption
[24627]6380    Smiling to himself, Harry closed his eyes 
[24628]0   
[24629]0   
[24630]173   The whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed to be growing more distant 
[24631]0   
[24632]0   
[24633]397    or perhaps he was simply speeding away from them 
[24634]0   
[24635]0   
[24636]841   He had fallen right into the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries
[24637]758    He was speeding towards the plain black door 
[24638]0   
[24639]0   
[24640]565    let it open 
[24641]0   
[24642]0   
[24643]565    let it open 
[24644]0   
[24645]0   
[24646]667   It did
[24647]784    He was inside the circular room lined with doors 
[24648]0   
[24649]0   
[24650]969    he crossed it, placed his hand on an identical door and it swung inwards 
[24651]0   
[24652]0   
[24653]889   Now he was in a long, rectangular room full of an odd mechanical clicking
[24654]930    There were dancing flecks of light on the walls but he did not pause to investigate 
[24655]0   
[24656]0   
[24657]0    he had to go on 
[24658]0   
[24659]0   
[24660]857   There was a door at the far end 
[24661]0   
[24662]0   
[24663]202    it, too, opened at his touch 
[24664]0   
[24665]0   
[24666]1046   And now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church, full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves, each laden with small, dusty, spun-glass spheres 
[24667]0   
[24668]0   
[24669]10700    now Harry's heart was beating fast with excitement 
[24670]0   
[24671]0   
[24672]278    he knew where to go 
[24673]0   
[24674]0   
[24675]771    he ran forwards, but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous, deserted room 
[24676]0   
[24677]0   
[24678]618   There was something in this room he wanted very, very much 
[24679]0   
[24680]0   
[24681]173   Something he wanted 
[24682]0   
[24683]0   
[24684]227    or somebody else wanted 
[24685]0   
[24686]0   
[24687]98   His scar was hurting 
[24688]0   
[24689]0   
[24690]26   BANG
[24691]5846  Harry awoke instantly, confused and angry
[24692]519    The dark dormitory was full of the sound of laughter
[24693]39   Cool
[24694]5330  ' said Seamus, who was silhouetted against the window
[24695]6589    I think one of those Catherine wheels hit a rocket and it's like they mated, come and see
[24696]8895  ' Harry heard Ron and Dean scramble out of bed for a better look
[24697]506    He lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and disappointment washed over him
[24698]597    He felt as though a wonderful treat had been snatched from him at the very last moment 
[24699]0   
[24700]0   
[24701]1344    he had got so close that time
[24702]642   Glittering pink and silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of Gryffindor Tower
[24703]5882    Harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below them
[24704]501    His stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had Occlumency the following evening
[24705]13080   Harry spent the whole of the next day dreading what Snape was going to say if he found out how much further into the Department of Mysteries Harry had penetrated during his last dream
[24706]2389    With a surge of guilt he realised that he had not practised Occlumency once since their last lesson: there had been too much going on since Dumbledore had left; he was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even if he had tried
[24707]518    He doubted, however, whether Snape would accept that excuse
[24708]925   He attempted a little last-minute practice during classes that day, but it was no good
[24709]3363    Hermione kept asking him what was wrong whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emotion and, after all, the best moment to empty his brain was not while teachers were firing revision questions at the class
[24710]5640   Resigned to the worst, he set off for Snape's office after dinner
[24711]724    Halfway across the Entrance Hall, however, Cho came hurrying up to him
[24712]12162   Over here,' said Harry, glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with Snape, and beckoning her across to the corner of the Entrance Hall where the giant hour-glasses stood
[24713]4943    Gryffindor's was now almost empty
[24714]82    Are you OK
[24715]3001   Umbridge hasn't been asking you about the DA, has she
[24716]5606  'Oh, no,' said Cho hurriedly
[24717]0    No, it was only 
[24718]0   
[24719]0   
[24720]1251    well, I just wanted to say 
[24721]0   
[24722]0   
[24723]6117    Harry, I never dreamed Marietta would tell 
[24724]0    
[24725]11099   'Yeah, well,' said Harry moodily
[24726]2326    He did feel Cho might have chosen her friends a bit more carefully; it was small consolation that the last he had heard, Marietta was still up in the hospital wing and Madam Pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to her pimples
[24727]10368   She's a lovely person really,' said Cho
[24728]7254    She just made a mistake-'Harry looked at her incredulously
[24729]118   A lovely person who made a mistake
[24730]22  She sold us all out, including you
[24731]0  'Well 
[24732]0   
[24733]0   
[24734]3742    we all got away, didn't we
[24735]5237  ' said Cho pleadingly
[24736]13265    You know, her mum works for the Ministry, it's really difficult for her-'Ron's dad works for the Ministry too
[24737]10867  ' Harry said furiously
[24738]18191    And in case you hadn't noticed, he hasn't got sneak written across his face-'That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger's,' said Cho fiercely
[24739]12527    She should have told us she'd jinxed that list-'I think it was a brilliant idea,' said Harry coldly
[24740]672    Cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter
[24741]14870   Oh yes, I forgot -of course, if it was darling Hermiones idea-'Don't start crying again,' said Harry warningly
[24742]2938   I wasn't going to
[24743]135  ' she shouted
[24744]277   Yeah 
[24745]0   
[24746]0   
[24747]0    well 
[24748]0   
[24749]0   
[24750]5429    good,' he said
[24751]1653    I've got enough to cope with at the moment
[24752]5   'Go and cope with it then
[24753]5389  ' Cho said furiously, turning on her heel and stalking off
[24754]18198   Fuming, Harry descended the stairs to Snape's dungeon and, though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for Snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful, he succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more things he should have said to Cho about Marietta before reaching the dungeon door
[24755]12435   You're late, Potter,' said Snape coldly, as Harry closed the door behind him
[24756]12169   Snape was standing with his back to Harry, removing, as usual, certain of his thoughts and placing them carefully in Dumbledore's Pensieve
[24757]6806    He dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and turned to face Harry
[24758]5086   So,' he said
[24759]14    Have you been practising
[24760]12147  'Yes,' Harry lied, looking carefully at one of the legs of Snape's desk
[24761]3085   Well, we'll soon find out, won't we
[24762]5584  ' said Snape smoothly
[24763]870    Wand out, Potter
[24764]6575   'Harry moved into his usual position, facing Snape with the desk between them
[24765]932    His heart was pumping last with anger at Cho and anxiety about how much Snape was about to extract from his mind
[24766]5592   On the count of three then,' said Snape lazily
[24767]6675    One-two-'Snape's office door banged open and Draco Malfoy sped in
[24768]9129   Professor Snape, sir-oh-sorry-'Malfoy was looking at Snape and Harry in some surprise
[24769]11352   It's all right, Draco,' said Snape, lowering his wand
[24770]815    Potter is here for a little remedial Potions
[24771]8377   'Harry had not seen Malfoy look so gleeful since Umbridge had turned up to inspect Hagrid
[24772]15130   I didn't know,' he said, leering at Harry, who knew his face was burning
[24773]1665    He would have given a great deal to be able to shout the truth at Malfoy-or, even better, to hit him with a good curse
[24774]61   Well, Draco, what is it
[24775]836  ' asked Snape
[24776]11903   It's Professor Umbridge, sir-she needs your help,' said Malfoy
[24777]6470   They've found Montague, sir, he's turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor
[24778]667   'How did he get in there
[24779]509  ' demanded Snape
[24780]8823   I don't know, sir, he's a bit confused
[24781]0   'Very well, very well
[24782]6219    Potter,' said Snape, we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening
[24783]546   'He turned and swept from his office
[24784]519    Malfoy mouthed, Remedial Potions
[24785]11003  ' at Harry behind Snape's back before following him
[24786]7079   Seething, Harry replaced his wand inside his robes and made to leave the room
[24787]1854    At least he had twenty-four more hours in which to practise; he knew he ought to feel grateful for the narrow escape, though it was hard that it came at the expense of Malfoy telling the whole school that he needed remedial Potions
[24788]1197   He was at the office door when he saw it: a patch of shivering light dancing on the doorframe
[24789]901    He stopped, and stood looking at it, reminded of something 
[24790]0   
[24791]0   
[24792]2428    then he remembered: it was a little like the lights he had seen in his dream last night, the lights in the second room he had walked through on his journey through the Department of Mysteries
[24793]332   He turned around
[24794]5763    The light was coming from the Pensieve sitting on Snape's desk
[24795]195    The silver-white contents were ebbing and swirling within
[24796]5254    Snape's thoughts 
[24797]0   
[24798]0   
[24799]12158    things he did not want Harry to see if he broke through Snape's defences accidentally 
[24800]0   
[24801]0   
[24802]5991   Harry gazed at the Pensieve, curiosity welling inside him 
[24803]0   
[24804]0   
[24805]6249    what was it that Snape was so keen to hide from Harry
[24806]178  The silvery lights shivered on the wall 
[24807]0   
[24808]0   
[24809]6410    Harry took two steps towards the desk, thinking hard
[24810]680    Could it possibly be information about the Department of Mysteries that Snape was determined to keep from him
[24811]6659  Harry looked over his shoulder, his heart now pumping harder and faster than ever
[24812]896    How long would it take Snape to release Montague from the toilet
[24813]839   Would he come straight back to his office afterwards, or accompany Montague to the hospital wing
[24814]30   Surely the latter 
[24815]0   
[24816]0   
[24817]2229    Montague was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, Snape would want to make sure he was all right
[24818]6394   Harry walked the remaining few feet to the Pensieve and stood over it, gazing into its depths
[24819]667    He hesitated, listening, then pulled out his wand again
[24820]407    The office and the corridor beyond were completely silent
[24821]1047    He gave the contents of the Pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand
[24822]292   The silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast
[24823]6161    Harry leaned forwards over it and saw that it had become transparent
[24824]1309    He was, once again, looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling 
[24825]0   
[24826]0   
[24827]1188    in fact, unless he was much mistaken, he was looking down into the Great Hall
[24828]5419   His breath was actually fogging the surface of Snape's thoughts 
[24829]0   
[24830]0   
[24831]50    his brain seemed to be in limbo 
[24832]0   
[24833]0   
[24834]204    it would be insane to do the thing he was so strongly tempted to do 
[24835]0   
[24836]0   
[24837]39    he was trembling 
[24838]0   
[24839]0   
[24840]745    Snape could be back at any moment 
[24841]0   
[24842]0   
[24843]16859    but Harry thought of Cho's anger, of Malfoy's jeering face, and a reckless daring seized him
[24844]6377   He took a great gulp of breath, and plunged his face into the surface of Snape's thoughts
[24845]6698    At once, the floor of the office lurched, tipping Harry head-first into the Pensieve 
[24846]0   
[24847]0   
[24848]1455   He was falling through cold blackness, spinning furiously as he went, and then-'He was standing in the middle of the Great Hall, but the four house tables were gone
[24849]1425    Instead, there were more than a hundred smaller tables, all facing the same way, at each of which sat a student, head bent low, scribbling on a roll of parchment
[24850]323    The only sound was the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted their parchment
[24851]652    It was clearly exam time
[24852]570   Sunshine was streaming through the high windows on to the bent heads, which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light
[24853]6464    Harry looked around carefully
[24854]480    Snape had to be here somewhere 
[24855]0   
[24856]0   
[24857]42    this was his memory 
[24858]0   
[24859]0   
[24860]6495   And there he was, at a table right behind Harry
[24861]5854    Harry stared
[24862]2119    Snape-the-teenager had a stringy, pallid look about him, like a plant kept in the dark
[24863]925    His hair was lank and greasy and was flopping on to the table, his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment as he scribbled
[24864]7049    Harry moved around behind Snape and read the heading of the examination paper: DEFENCE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS-ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL
[24865]11006   So Snape had to be fifteen or sixteen, around Harry's own age
[24866]730    His hand was flying across the parchment; he had written at least a foot more than his closest neighbours, and yet his writing was minuscule and cramped
[24867]112   Five more minutes
[24868]6290  'The voice made Harry jump
[24869]6987    Turning, he saw the top of Professor Flitwick's head moving between the desks a short distance away
[24870]1542    Professor Flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair 
[24871]0   
[24872]0   
[24873]411    very untidy black hair 
[24874]0   
[24875]0   
[24876]6118   Harry moved so quickly that, had he been solid, he would have knocked desks flying
[24877]87    Instead he seemed to slide, dreamlike, across two aisles and up a third
[24878]5703    The back of the black-haired boy's head drew nearer and 
[24879]0   
[24880]0   
[24881]365    he was straightening up now, putting down his quill, pulling his roll of parchment towards him so as to reread what he had written 
[24882]0   
[24883]0   
[24884]6476   Harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteen-year-old father
[24885]719   Excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach: it was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes
[24886]50286    James's eyes were hazel, his nose was slightly longer than Harry's and there was no scar on his forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same eyebrows; James's hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry's did, his hands could have been Harry's and Harry could tell that, when James stood up, they would be within an inch of each other in height
[24887]370   James yawned hugely and rumpled up his hair, making it even messier than it had been
[24888]1508    Then, with a glance towards Professor Flitwick, he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats behind him
[24889]6849   With another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbs-up
[24890]849    Sirius was lounging in his chair at his ease, tilting it back on two legs
[24891]20452    He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James's nor Harry's could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, though he didn't seem to have noticed
[24892]11041    And two seats along from this girl-Harry's stomach gave another pleasurable squirm- was Remus Lupin
[24893]767    He looked rather pale and peaky (was the full moon approaching
[24894]556  ) and was absorbed in the exam: as he reread his answers, he scratched his chin with the end of his quill, frowning slightly
[24895]67   So that meant Wormtail had to be around here somewhere, too 
[24896]0   
[24897]0   
[24898]6563    and sure enough, Harry spotted him within seconds: a small, mousy-haired boy with a pointed nose
[24899]1086    Wormtail looked anxious; he was chewing his fingernails, staring down at his paper, scuffing the ground with his toes
[24900]4883    Every now and then he glanced hopefully at his neighbour's paper
[24901]6534    Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment, then back at James, who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment
[24902]108    He had drawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters L
[24903]17   E
[24904]0   '
[24905]734    What did they stand for
[24906]18  Quills down, please
[24907]795  ' squeaked Professor Flitwick
[24908]46    That means you too, Stebbins
[24909]157   Please remain seated while I collect your parchment
[24910]10   Accio
[24911]6236  ' Over a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and into Professor Flitwick's outstretched arms, knocking him backwards off his feet
[24912]364    Several people laughed
[24913]2279    A couple of students at the front desks got up, took hold of Professor Flitwick beneath the elbows and lifted him back on to his feet
[24914]40   Thank you 
[24915]0   
[24916]0   
[24917]841    thank you,' panted Professor Flitwick
[24918]104    Very well, everybody, you're free to go
[24919]6585  'Harry looked down at his father, who had hastily crossed out the L
[24920]17   E
[24921]1447   ' he had been embellishing, jumped to his feet, stuffed his quill and the exam paper into his bag, which he slung over his back, and stood waiting for Sirius to join him
[24922]8231   Harry looked around and glimpsed Snape a short way away, moving between the tables towards the doors to the Entrance Hall, still absorbed in his own exam paper
[24923]1027    Round-shouldered yet angular, he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, and his oily hair was jumping about his face
[24924]8150   A gang of chattering girls separated Snape from James, Sirius and Lupin, and by planting himself in their midst, Harry managed to keep Snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of James and his friends
[24925]1455   Did you like question ten, Moony
[24926]1313  ' asked Sirius as they emerged into the Entrance Hall
[24927]5278   Loved it, said Lupin briskly
[24928]48    Give five signs that identify the werewolf
[24929]87   Excellent question
[24930]1277   'D'you think you managed to get all the signs
[24931]5192  ' said James in tones of mock concern
[24932]6813   Think I did,' said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds
[24933]4986    One: he's sitting on my chair
[24934]4845    Two: he's wearing my clothes
[24935]4924    Three: his name's Remus Lupin
[24936]2782   'Wormtail was the only one who didn't laugh
[24937]9360   I got the snout shape, the pupils of the eyes and the tufted tail,' he said anxiously, but I couldn't think what else-'How thick are you, Wormtail
[24938]5209  ' said James impatiently
[24939]951    You run round with a werewolf once a month-'Keep your voice down,' implored Lupin
[24940]6443   Harry looked anxiously behind him again
[24941]18660    Snape remained close by, still buried in his exam questions-but this was Snape's memory and Harry was sure that if Snape chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds, he, Harry, would not be able to follow James any further
[24942]1635    To his intense relief, however, when James and his three friends strode off down the lawn towards the lake, Snape followed, still poring over the exam paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he was going
[24943]6439    By keeping a little ahead of him, Harry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others
[24944]1663   Well, I thought that paper was a piece of cake,' he heard Sirius say
[24945]3557    I'll be surprised if I don't get Outstanding on it at least
[24946]5164   'Me too,' said James
[24947]748    He put his hand in his pocket and took out a struggling Golden Snitch
[24948]621   Where'd you get that
[24949]5175  'Nicked it,' said James casually
[24950]720    He started playing with the Snitch, allowing it to fly as much as a foot away before seizing it again; his reflexes were excellent
[24951]113    Wormtail watched him in awe
[24952]9848   They stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where Harry, Ron and Hermione had once spent a Sunday finishing their homework, and threw themselves down on the grass
[24953]7417    Harry looked over his shoulder yet again and saw, to his delight, that Snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadow of a clump of bushes
[24954]6466    He was as deeply immersed in the OWL paper as ever, which left Harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree
[24955]2231    The sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake, on the bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the Great Hall were sitting, with their shoes and socks off, cooling their feet in the water
[24956]465   Lupin had pulled out a book and was reading
[24957]1575    Sirius stared around at the students milling over the grass, looking rather haughty and bored, but very handsomely so
[24958]726    James was still playing with the Snitch, letting it zoom further and further away, almost escaping but always grabbed at the last second
[24959]590    Wormtail was watching him with his mouth open
[24960]833    Every time James made a particularly difficult catch, Wormtail gasped and applauded
[24961]9188    After five minutes of this, Harry wondered why James didn't tell Wormtail to get a grip on himself, but James seemed to be enjoying the attention
[24962]11782    Harry noticed that his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to keep it from getting too tidy, and he also kept looking over at the girls by the water's edge
[24963]6732   Put that away, will you,' said Sirius finally, as James made a fine catch and Wormtail let out a cheer, before Wormtail wets himself with excitement
[24964]656   ' Wormtail turned slightly pink, but James grinned
[24965]5192   If it bothers you,' he said, stuffing the Snitch back in his pocket
[24966]6643    Harry had the distinct impression that Sirius was the only one for whom James would have stopped showing off
[24967]6193   I'm bored,' said Sirius
[24968]74    Wish it was full moon
[24969]5348   'You might,' said Lupin darkly from behind his book
[24970]1448    We've still got Transfiguration, if you're bored you could test me
[24971]0    Here 
[24972]0   
[24973]0   
[24974]135   ' and he held out his book
[24975]657   But Sirius snorted
[24976]4380    I don't need to look at that rubbish, I know it all
[24977]5874   ' This'll liven you up, Padfoot,' said James quietly
[24978]457    Look who it is
[24979]6219   ' Sirius's head turned
[24980]761    He became very still, like a dog that has scented a rabbit
[24981]5167   Excellent,' he said softly
[24982]4    Snivellus
[24983]7316   'Harry turned to see what Sirius was looking at
[24984]951   Snape was on his feet again, and was stowing the OWL paper in his bag
[24985]1341    As he left the shadows of the bushes and set off across the grass, Sirius and James stood up
[24986]4357   Lupin and Wormtail remained sitting: Lupin was still staring down at his book, though his eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his eyebrows; Wormtail was looking from Sirius and James to Snape with a look of avid anticipation on his face
[24987]561   All right, Snivellus
[24988]5300  ' said James loudly
[24989]2308   Snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack: dropping his bag, he plunged his hand inside his robes and his wand was halfway into the air when James shouted, Expelliarmus
[24990]6581  'Snape's wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud in the grass behind him
[24991]1032    Sirius let out a bark of laughter
[24992]5   Impedimenta
[24993]6849  ' he said, pointing his wand at Snape, who was knocked off his feet halfway through a dive towards his own fallen wand
[24994]560   Students all around had turned to watch
[24995]978    Some of them had got to their feet and were edging nearer
[24996]684    Some looked apprehensive, others entertained
[24997]697   Snape lay panting on the ground
[24998]6192    James and Sirius advanced on him, wands raised, James glancing over his shoulder at the girls at the water's edge as he went
[24999]631    Wormtail was on his feet now, watching hungrily, edging around Lupin to get a clearer view
[25000]650   How'd the exam go, Snivelly
[25001]5164  ' said James
[25002]6123   I was watching him, his nose was touching the parchment,' said Sirius viciously
[25003]3617    There'll be great grease marks all over it, they won't be able to read a word
[25004]1058   'Several people watching laughed; Snape was clearly unpopular
[25005]42    Wormtail sniggered shrilly
[25006]834    Snape was trying to get up, but the jinx was still operating on him; he was struggling, as though bound by invisible ropes
[25007]497   You-wait,' he panted, staring up at James with an expression of purest loathing, you- wait
[25008]77  'Wait for what
[25009]5759  ' said Sirius coolly
[25010]612    What're you going to do, Snivelly, wipe your nose on us
[25011]2090  'Snape let out a stream of mixed swear words and hexes, but with his wand ten feet away nothing happened
[25012]5387   Wash out your mouth,' said James coldly
[25013]3    Scourgify
[25014]5742  'Pink soap bubbles streamed from Snape's mouth at once; the froth was covering his lips, making him gag, choking him-'Leave him ALONE
[25015]1526  'James and Sirius looked round
[25016]5501    James's free hand immediately jumped to his hair
[25017]111   It was one of the girls from the lake edge
[25018]12296    She had thick, dark red hair that fell to her shoulders, and startlingly green almond-shaped eyes-Harry's eyes
[25019]10568   Harry's mother
[25020]565   All right, Evans
[25021]5856  ' said James, and the tone of his voice was suddenly pleasant, deeper, more mature
[25022]186   Leave him alone,' Lily repeated
[25023]1017    She was looking at James with every sign of great dislike
[25024]4750    What's he done to you
[25025]11094  'Well,' said James, appearing to deliberate the point, it's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean 
[25026]0   
[25027]0   
[25028]4580   'Many of the surrounding students laughed, Sirius and Wormtail included, but Lupin, still apparently intent on his book, didn't, and nor did Lily
[25029]5733   You think you're funny,' she said coldly
[25030]1279    But you're just an arrogant, bullying toerag, Potter
[25031]122    Leave him alone
[25032]5327   'I will if you go out with me, Evans,' said James quickly
[25033]0    Go on 
[25034]0   
[25035]0   
[25036]1248    go out with me and I'll never lay a wand on old Snivelly again
[25037]105   'Behind him, the Impediment Jinx was wearing off
[25038]965    Snape was beginning to inch towards his fallen wand, spitting out soapsuds as he crawled
[25039]7598   I wouldn't go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid,' said Lily
[25040]6682   Bad luck, Prongs,' said Sirius briskly, and turned back to Snape
[25041]5    OI
[25042]6955  ' But too late; Snape had directed his wand straight at James; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James's face, spattering his robes with blood
[25043]2068    James whirled about: a second flash of light later, Snape was hanging upside-down in the air, his robes falling over his head to reveal skinny, pallid legs and a pair of greying underpants
[25044]1406   Many people in the small crowd cheered; Sirius, James and Wormtail roared with laughter
[25045]6123   Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile, said, Let him down
[25046]6396  'Certainly,' said James and he jerked his wand upwards; Snape fell into a crumpled heap on the ground
[25047]7392    Disentangling himself from his robes he got quickly to his feet, wand up, but Sirius said, Petrificus Totalus
[25048]514  ' and Snape keeled over again, rigid as a board
[25049]122   LEAVE HIM ALONE
[25050]146  ' Lily shouted
[25051]409    She had her own wand out now
[25052]748    James and Sirius eyed it warily
[25053]8384   Ah, Evans, don't make me hex you,' said James earnestly
[25054]43   Take the curse off him, then
[25055]1123  'James sighed deeply, then turned to Snape and muttered the counter-curse
[25056]5825   There you go,' he said, as Snape struggled to his feet
[25057]4362    You're lucky Evans was here, Snivellus- 'I don't need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her
[25058]25  'Lily blinked
[25059]5187   Fine,' she said coolly
[25060]2475    I won't bother in future
[25061]637    And I'd wash your pants if I were you, Snivellus
[25062]11   'Apologise to Evans
[25063]1104  ' James roared at Snape, his wand pointed threateningly at him
[25064]3715   I don't want you to make him apologise,' Lily shouted, rounding on James
[25065]92    You're as bad as he is
[25066]0   'What
[25067]87  ' yelped James
[25068]1392    I'd NEVER call you a-you-know-what
[25069]6492  'Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you've just got off your broomstick, showing off with that stupid Snitch, walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can-I'm surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it
[25070]240    You make me SICK
[25071]765   'She turned on her heel and hurried away
[25072]8   Evans
[25073]213  ' James shouted after her
[25074]34    Hey, EVANS
[25075]3165  'But she didn't look back
[25076]0   What is it with her
[25077]5980  ' said James, trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him
[25078]6967   Reading between the lines, I'd say she thinks you're a bit conceited, mate,' said Sirius
[25079]7838   Right,' said James, who looked furious now, right-'There was another flash of light, and Snape was once again hanging upside-down in the air
[25080]4795   Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's pants
[25081]11998  'But whether James really did take off Snape's pants, Harry never found out
[25082]1471    A hand had closed tight over his upper arm, closed with a pincer-like grip
[25083]8288    Wincing, Harry looked round to see who had hold of him, and saw, with a thrill of horror, a fully grown, adult-sized Snape standing right beside him, white with rage
[25084]124   Having fun
[25085]16975  'Harry felt himself rising into the air; the summer's day evaporated around him; he was floating upwards through icy blackness, Snape's hand still tight upon his upper arm
[25086]17649    Then, with a swooping feeling as though he had turned head-over-heels in midair, his feet hit the stone floor of Snape's dungeon and he was standing again beside the Pensieve on Snape's desk in the shadowy, present-day Potion master's study
[25087]27228   So,' said Snape, gripping Harry's arm so tightly Harry's hand was starting to feel numb
[25088]0    So 
[25089]0   
[25090]0   
[25091]479    been enjoying yourself, Potter
[25092]11235  'N-no,' said Harry, trying to free his arm
[25093]6008   It was scary: Snape's lips were shaking, his face was white, his teeth were bared
[25094]2675   Amusing man, your father, wasn't he
[25095]11785  ' said Snape, shaking Harry so hard his glasses slipped down his nose
[25096]8987   I-didn't-'Snape threw Harry from him with all his might
[25097]6349    Harry fell hard on to the dungeon floor
[25098]355   You will not repeat what you saw to anybody
[25099]514  ' Snape bellowed
[25100]11795   No,' said Harry, getting to his feet as far from Snape as he could
[25101]3681    No, of course I w-'Get out, get out, I don't want to see you in this office ever again
[25102]6853  'And as Harry hurtled towards the door, a jar of dead cockroaches exploded over his head
[25103]1390    He wrenched the door open and Hew along the corridor, stopping only when he had put three floors between himself and Snape
[25104]323    There he leaned against the wall, panting, and rubbing his bruised arm
[25105]5282   He had no desire at all to return to Gryffindor Tower so early, nor to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just seen
[25106]10234    What was making Harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at him; it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew exactly how Snape had felt as his father had taunted him, and that judging from what he had just seen, his father had been every bit as arrogant as Snape had always told him

[25117]3224     But why haven't you got Occlumency lessons any more
[25118]6742  ' said Hermione, frowning
[25119]6854   I've told you,' Harry muttered
[25120]1899    Snape reckons I can carry on by myself now I've got the basics
[25121]1002   'So you've stopped having funny dreams
[25122]6706  ' said Hermione sceptically
[25123]11451   Pretty much,' said Harry, not looking at her
[25124]4397   Well, I don't think Snape should stop until you're absolutely sure you can control them
[25125]6718  ' said Hermione indignantly
[25126]17236    Harry, I think you should go back to him and ask- 'No,' said Harry forcefully
[25127]2526    Just drop it, Hermione, OK
[25128]2287  'It was the first day of the Easter holidays and Hermione, as was her custom, had spent a large part of the day drawing up revision timetables for the three of them
[25129]8595    Harry and Ron had let her do it; it was easier than arguing with her and, in any case, they might come in useful
[25130]2355   Ron had been startled to discover there were only six weeks left until their exams
[25131]470   How can that come as a shock
[25132]9261  ' Hermione demanded, as she tapped each little square on Ron's timetable with her wand so that it flashed a different colour according to its subject
[25133]12462   I dunno,' said Ron, there's been a lot going on
[25134]5222   'Well, there you are,' she said, handing him his timetable, if you follow that you should do fine
[25135]2691   'Ron looked down it gloomily, but then brightened
[25136]908   You've given me an evening off every week
[25137]11637  'That's for Quidditch practice,' said Hermione
[25138]7385   The smile faded from Ron's face
[25139]4835   What's the point
[25140]5108  ' he said dully
[25141]7629    We've got about as much chance of winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad's got of becoming Minister for Magic
[25142]14694   'Hermione said nothing; she was looking at Harry, who was staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks pawed at his hand, trying to get his ears scratched
[25143]10560   What's wrong, Harry
[25144]0  'What
[25145]5241  ' he said quickly
[25146]0    Nothing
[25147]861   'He seized his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and pretended to be looking something up in the index
[25148]7218    Crookshanks gave him up as a bad job and slunk away under Hermione's chair
[25149]7204   I saw Cho earlier,' said Hermione tentatively

[25151]0   
[25152]0   
[25153]44    have you two had a row again
[25154]11505  'Wha-oh, yeah, we have,' said Harry, seizing gratefully on the excuse
[25155]0   What about
[25156]10930  'That sneak friend of hers, Marietta,' said Harry
[25157]3236   Yeah, well, I don't blame you
[25158]7209  ' said Ron angrily, setting down his revision timetable
[25159]2408    If it hadn't been for her 
[25160]0   
[25161]0   
[25162]17010   'Ron went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe, which Harry found helpful; all he had to do was look angry, nod and say Yeah' and That's right' whenever Ron drew breath, leaving his mind free to dwell, ever more miserably, on what he had seen in the Pensieve
[25163]546   He felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside
[25164]6019    He had been so sure his parents were wonderful people that he had never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving the aspersions Snape cast on his father's character
[25165]10929    Hadn't people like Hagrid and Sirius told Harry how wonderful his father had been
[25166]18915   (Yeah, well, look what Sirius was like himself, said a nagging voice inside Harry's head 
[25167]0   
[25168]0   
[25169]2541    he was as bad, wasn't he
[25170]9679  ) Yes, he had once overheard Professor McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside-down for the fun of it 
[25171]0   
[25172]0   
[25173]332    not unless they really loathed them 
[25174]0   
[25175]0   
[25176]788    perhaps Malfoy or somebody who really deserved it 
[25177]19254   Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had suffered at James's hands: but hadn't Lily asked, What's he done to you
[25178]8333  ' And hadn't James replied, It's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean
[25179]8399   ' Hadn't James started it all simply because Sirius had said he was bored
[25180]8091   Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place that Dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius 
[25181]0   
[25182]0   
[25183]526    but in the Pensieve, he had sat there and let it all happen 
[25184]0   
[25185]0   
[25186]5967   Harry kept reminding himself that Lily had intervened; his mother had been decent
[25187]7476    Yet, the memory of the look on her face as she had shouted at James disturbed him quite as much as anything else; she had clearly loathed James, and Harry simply could not understand how they could have ended up married
[25188]183    Once or twice he even wondered whether James had forced her into it 
[25189]0   
[25190]0   
[25191]790   For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort, of inspiration
[25192]1352    Whenever someone had told him he was like James, he had glowed with pride inside
[25193]0    And now 
[25194]0   
[25195]0   
[25196]789    now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him
[25197]6525   The weather grew breezier, brighter and warmer as the Easter holidays passed, but Harry, along with the rest of the fifth- and seventh-years, was trapped inside, revising, traipsing back and forth to the library
[25198]6252    Harry pretended his bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams, and as his fellow Gryffindors were sick of studying themselves, his excuse went unchallenged
[25199]6506   Harry, I'm talking to you, can you hear me
[25200]1  'Huh
[25201]801  'He looked round
[25202]1980    Ginny Weasley, looking very windswept, had joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone
[25203]4346    It was late on Sunday evening: Hermione had gone back to Gryffindor Tower to revise Ancient Runes, and Ron had Quidditch practice
[25204]11360   Oh, hi,' said Harry, pulling his books towards him
[25205]476    How come you're not at practice
[25206]10172  'It's over,' said Ginny
[25207]2118    Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hospital wing
[25208]0   'Why
[25209]845  'Well, we're not sure, but we think he knocked himself out with his own bat
[25210]80   ' She sighed heavily
[25211]0    Anyway 
[25212]0   
[25213]0   
[25214]12601    a package just arrived, it's only just got through Umbridge's new screening process
[25215]425   'She hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper on to the table; it had clearly been unwrapped and carelessly re-wrapped
[25216]752    There was a scribbled note across it in red ink, reading: Inspected and Passed by the Hogwarts High Inquisitor
[25217]10278    It's Easter eggs from Mum,' said Ginny
[25218]4750    There's one for you 
[25219]0   
[25220]0   
[25221]0    there you go
[25222]343   'She handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small, iced Snitches and, according to the packaging, containing a bag of Fizzing Whizzbees
[25223]7031    Harry looked at it for a moment, then, to his horror, felt a lump rise in his throat
[25224]5814   Are you OK, Harry
[25225]829  ' Ginny asked quietly
[25226]11622   Yeah, I'm fine,' said Harry gruffly
[25227]60    The lump in his throat was painful
[25228]1643    He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made him feel like this
[25229]640   You seem really down lately,' Ginny persisted
[25230]2414    You know, I'm sure if you just talked to Cho 
[25231]0   
[25232]0   
[25233]16177   'It's not Cho I want to talk to,' said Harry brusquely
[25234]0   Who is it, then
[25235]890  ' asked Ginny, watching him closely
[25236]0   I 
[25237]0

[25239]738   'He glanced around to make quite sure nobody was listening
[25240]1233    Madam Pince was several shelves away, stamping out a pile cf books for a frantic-looking Hannah Abbott
[25241]923   I wish I could talk to Sirius,' he muttered
[25242]3079    But I know I can't
[25243]518   'Ginny continued to watch him thoughtfully
[25244]6860    More to give himself something to do than because he really wanted any, Harry unwrapped his Easter egg, broke off a large bit and put it into his mouth
[25245]8142   Well,' said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg, too, if you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to do it
[25246]11276   'Come on,' said Harry dully
[25247]647    With Umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail
[25248]12866  'The thing about growing up with Fred and George,' said Ginny thoughtfully, is that you sort of start thinking anything's possible if you've got enough nerve
[25249]6408   'Harry looked at her
[25250]1268    Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate-Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with dementors-or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside him for a week, but he felt a bit more hopeful
[25251]744   WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING
[25252]1086  'Oh damn,' whispered Ginny, jumping to her feet
[25253]694    I forgot-'Madam Pince was swooping down on them, her shrivelled face contorted with rage
[25254]51   Chocolate in the library
[25255]36  ' she screamed
[25256]0    Out-out-OUT
[25257]12092  ' And whipping out her wand, she caused Harry's books, bag and ink bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library, whacking them repeatedly over the head as they ran
[25258]1687   As though to underline the importance of their upcoming examinations, a batch of pamphlets, leaflets and notices concerning various wizarding careers appeared on the tables in Gryffindor Tower shortly before the end of the holidays, along with yet another notice on the board, which read:CAREERS ADVICEAll fifth-years are required to attend a short meeting with theirHead of House during the first week of the summer term to discusstheir future careers
[25259]78    Times of individual appointments are listed below
[25260]13024    Harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in Professor McGonagall's office at half past two on Monday, which would mean missing most of Divination
[25261]713    He and the other fifth-years spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all the careers information that had been left there for their perusal
[25262]10161   Well, I don't fancy Healing,' said Ron on the last evening of the holidays
[25263]524    He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed bone-and-wand emblem of St
[25264]4785    Mungo's on its front
[25265]924    It says here you need at least E at NEWT level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration, Charms and Defence Against the Dark Arts

[25273]7211  'Well, it's a very responsible job, isn't it
[25274]6706  ' said Hermione absently
[25275]2270   She was poring over a bright pink and orange leaflet, that was headed, SO YOU THINK YOU'D LIKE TO WORK IN MUGGLE RELATIONS
[25276]4175  ' You don't seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles; all they want is an OWL in Muggle Studies: Much more important is your enthusiasm, patience and a good sense of fun
[25277]12206  'You'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,' said Harry darkly
[25278]1115    Good sense of when to duck, more like
[25279]202   ' He was halfway through a pamphlet on wizard banking
[25280]152    Listen to this: Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure and substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses
[25281]159   Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, who are currently recruiting Curse-Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad 
[25282]0   
[25283]0   
[25284]1956   They want Arithmancy, though; you could do it, Hermione
[25285]10466  'I don't much fancy banking,' said Hermione vaguely, now immersed in: HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO TRAIN SECURITY TROLLS
[25286]16194  'Hey,' said a voice in Harry's ear
[25287]2080    He looked round; Fred and George had come to join them
[25288]11738    Ginny's had a word with us about you,' said Fred, stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to slide off on to the floor
[25289]1036    She says you need to talk to Sirius
[25290]0  'What
[25291]7599  ' said Hermione sharply, freezing with her hand halfway towards picking up MAKE A BANG AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MAGICAL ACCIDENTS AND CATASTROPHES'
[25292]277   Yeah 
[25293]0   
[25294]0   
[25295]24025   ' said Harry, trying to sound casual, yeah, I thought I'd like-'Don't be so ridiculous,' said Hermione, straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes
[25296]650    With Umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls
[25297]6465  'Well, we think we can find a way around that,' said George, stretching and smiling
[25298]4887    It's a simple matter of causing a diversion
[25299]165    Now, you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the Easter holidays
[25300]1003  'What was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure time
[25301]516  ' continued Fred
[25302]101    No point at all, we answered ourselves
[25303]7057    And of course, we'd have messed up people's revision, too, which would be the very last thing we'd want to do
[25304]2147   'He gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod
[25305]766    She looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness
[25306]5458   But it's business as usual from tomorrow,' Fred continued briskly
[25307]7103    And if we're going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that Harry can have his chat with Sirius
[25308]13211  'Yes, but still,' said Hermione, with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse, even if you do cause a diversion, how is Harry supposed to talk to him
[25309]16446  'Umbridge's office,' said Harry quietly
[25310]532   He had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could come up with no alternative
[25311]982    Umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was not being watched was her own
[25312]7   Are-you- insane
[25313]7254  ' said Hermione in a hushed voice
[25314]2225   Ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the Cultivated Fungus Trade and was watching the conversation warily
[25315]14336   I don't think so,' said Harry, shrugging
[25316]672   And how are you going to get in there in the first place
[25317]5864  'Harry was ready for this question
[25318]10503   Sirius's knife,' he said
[25319]22   Excuse me
[25320]12607  'Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that'll open any lock,' said Harry
[25321]8411    So even if she's bewitched the door so Alahomora won't work, which I bet she has- 'What do you think about this
[25322]9768  ' Hermione demanded of Ron, and Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs
[25323]11410    Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry's first dinner in Grimmauld Place
[25324]8121   I dunno,' said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion
[25325]12929    If Harry wants to do it, it's up to him, isn't it
[25326]9194  'Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,' said Fred, clapping Ron hard on the back
[25327]557    Right, then
[25328]13924    We're thinking of doing it tomorrow, just after lessons, because it should cause maximum impact in everybody's in the corridors-Harry, we'll set it off in the east wing somewhere, draw her right away from her own office-I reckon we should be able to guarantee you, what, twenty minutes
[25329]6069  ' he said, looking at George
[25330]5488   Easy,' said George
[25331]78   What sort of diversion is it
[25332]2358  ' asked Ron
[25333]7441   You'll see, little bro', said Fred, as he and George got up again
[25334]5202    At least, you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy's corridor round about five o'clock tomorrow
[25335]6754   'Harry awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic
[25336]14428    It was not only the prospect of breaking into Umbridge's office and using her fire to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous, though that was certainly bad enough; today also happened to be the first time Harry would be in close proximity to Snape since Snape had thrown him out of his office
[25337]12834   After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, Harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville's bed, and stared out on a truly glorious morning
[25338]180    The sky was a clear, misty, opalescent blue
[25339]6465    Directly ahead of him, Harry could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented Snape
[25340]12988    He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was desperate to hear Sirius's own account of what had happened, to know of any mitigating factors there might have been, any excuse at all for his father's behaviour 
[25341]0   
[25342]0   
[25343]10828   Something caught Harry's attention: movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest
[25344]6835    Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid emerging from between the trees
[25345]3    He seemed to be limping
[25346]7259    As Harry watched, Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it
[25347]5973    Harry watched the cabin for several minutes
[25348]2065    Hagrid did not emerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so Hagrid could not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire
[25349]6798   Harry turned away from the window, headed back to his trunk and started to dress
[25350]5571   With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge's office ahead
[25351]12498    Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one, but he had not reckoned on Hermione's almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five o'clock
[25352]15538    For the first time ever, she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic as Harry and Ron were, keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that Harry tried very hard to ignore
[25353]0   
[25354]0   
[25355]0   
[25356]3122    and if she does catch you there, apart from being expelled, she'll be able to guess you've been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect she'll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions 
[25357]0   
[25358]0   
[25359]16409   'Hermione,' said Ron in a low and indignant voice, are you going to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to take my own notes
[25360]2589  'You take notes for a change, it won't kill you
[25361]10091  'By the time they reached the dungeons, neither Harry nor Ron was speaking to Hermione
[25362]709    Undeterred, she took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings, all uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks
[25363]6300   Snape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry were invisible
[25364]11157    Harry was, of course, well-used to this tactic, as it was one of Uncle Vernon's favourites, and on the whole was grateful he had to suffer nothing worse
[25365]1816    In fact, compared to what he usually had to endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, he found the new approach something of an improvement, and was pleased to find that when left well alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily
[25366]6134    At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask, corked it and took it up to Snape's desk for marking, feeling that he might at last have scraped an E'
[25367]1832   He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise
[25368]741    Malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter
[25369]5745    Harry whipped around
[25370]1402    His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and Snape was surveying him with a look of gloating pleasure
[25371]5135   Whoops,' he said softly
[25372]465    Another zero, then, Potter
[25373]5811   'Harry was too incensed to speak
[25374]1163    He strode back to his cauldron, intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished
[25375]536   I'm sorry
[25376]7058  ' said Hermione, with her hands over her mouth
[25377]6556    I'm really sorry, Harry
[25378]1106    I thought you'd finished, so I cleared up
[25379]5838  'Harry could not bring himself to answer
[25380]8194    When the bell rang, he hurried out of the dungeon without a backwards glance, and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him again about using Umbridge's office
[25381]7639   He was in such a bad mood by the time he got to Divination that he had quite forgotten his careers appointment with Professor McGonagall, remembering it only when Ron asked him why he wasn't in her office
[25382]362    He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only a few minutes late
[25383]1461   Sorry, Professor,' he panted, as he closed the door
[25384]21    I forgot
[25385]5875   'No matter, Potter,' she said briskly, but as she spoke, somebody else sniffed from the corner
[25386]6533    Harry looked round
[25387]2643   Professor Umbridge was sitting there, a clipboard on her knee, a fussy little pie-frill around her neck and a small, horribly smug smile on her face
[25388]6600   Sit down, Potter,' said Professor McGonagall tersely
[25389]556    Her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk
[25390]7506   Harry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard
[25391]7154   Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years,' said Professor McGonagall
[25392]1120    Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts
[25393]10939  'Er-' said Harry
[25394]107   He was finding the scratching noise from behind him very distracting
[25395]292   Yes
[25396]6740  ' Professor McGonagall prompted Harry
[25397]6236   Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,' Harry mumbled
[25398]7534   You'd need top grades for that,' said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it
[25399]139    They ask for a minimum of five NEWTs, and nothing under Exceeds Expectations grade, I see
[25400]228    Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office
[25401]5388    It's a difficult career path, Potter, they only take the best
[25402]3851    In fact, I don't think anybody has been taken on in the last three years
[25403]2267   'At this moment, Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough, as though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it
[25404]1029    Professor McGonagall ignored her
[25405]1810   You'll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose
[25406]663  ' she went on, talking a little louder than before
[25407]11110   Yes,' said Harry
[25408]506    Defence Against the Dark Arts, I suppose
[25409]6101  'Naturally,' said Professor McGonagall crisply
[25410]2423    I would also advise-' Professor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this time
[25411]2254    Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened them again, and continued as though nothing had happened
[25412]348   I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work
[25413]1213    And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my NEWT classes unless they have achieved Exceeds Expectations or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level
[25414]2698    I'd say you're averaging Acceptable at the moment, so you'll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing
[25415]179    Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions
[25416]1008    Yes, Potter, Potions,' she added, with the merest flicker of a smile
[25417]52    Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors
[25418]3375    And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than Outstanding in their OWLs, so -'Professor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet
[25419]76   May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores
[25420]3301  ' Professor McGonagall asked curtly, without looking at Professor Umbridge
[25421]11859   Oh, no, thank you very much,' said Umbridge, with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much
[25422]1076    I just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interruption, Minerva
[25423]6771  'I daresay you'll find you can,' said Professor McGonagall through tightly gritted teeth
[25424]1218   I was just wondering whether Mr
[25425]670    Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror
[25426]6423  ' said Professor Umbridge sweetly
[25427]0   Were you
[25428]6095  ' said Professor McGonagall haughtily
[25429]859    Well, Potter,' she continued, as though there had been no interruption, if you are serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch
[25430]971    I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between Acceptable and Exceeds Expectations for the last two years, so your Charmwork seems satisfactory
[25431]5527    As for Defence Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you-are you quite sure you wouldn't like a cough drop, Dolores
[25432]2748  'Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva,' simpered Professor Umbridge, who had just coughed her loudest yet
[25433]11772    I was just concerned that you might not have Harry's most recent Defence Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you
[25434]950    I'm quite sure I slipped in a note
[25435]185   'What, this thing
[25436]16969  ' said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry's folder
[25437]435    She glanced down it, her eyebrows slightly raised, then placed it back into the folder without comment
[25438]3139   Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject, and obviously for an Auror-'Did you not understand my note, Minerva
[25439]1330  ' asked Professor Umbndge in honeyed tones, quite forgetting to cough
[25440]7094   Of course I understood it,' said Professor McGonagall, her teeth clenched so tightly the words came out a little muffled
[25441]24   Well, then, I am confused 
[25442]0   
[25443]0   
[25444]4068    I'm afraid I don't quite understand how you can give Mr
[25445]603    Potter false hope that-'False hope
[25446]2969  ' repeated Professor McGonagall, still refusing to look round at Professor Umbridge
[25447]14743    He has achieved high marks in all his Defence Against the Dark Arts tests-'I'm terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me-'I should have made my meaning plainer,' said Professor McGonagall, turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes
[25448]793    He has achieved high marks in all Defence Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher
[25449]6486   'Professor Umbridge's smile vanished as suddenly as a light bulb blowing
[25450]1337    She sat back in her chair, turned a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed, her bulging eyes rolling from side to side
[25451]7592    Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her thin nostrils flared, her eyes burning
[25452]503   Any questions, Potter
[25453]11110  'Yes,' said Harry
[25454]313    What sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you, if you get enough NEWTs
[25455]7334  'Well, you'll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth,' said Professor McGonagall, perseverance and dedication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to mention very high skills in practical Defence
[25456]9342    It will mean a lot more study even after you've left school, so unless you're prepared to-'I think you'll also find,' said Umbridge, her voice very cold now, that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors
[25457]9    Their criminal records
[25458]2363   '-unless you're prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts, you should really look at another-'Which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school
[25459]6490   'A very good chance, then,' said Professor McGonagall
[25460]6271   Potter has a criminal record,' said Umbridge loudly
[25461]5974   Potter has been cleared of all charges,' said McGonagall, even more loudly
[25462]1478   Professor Umbridge stood up
[25463]2726    She was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference, but her fussy, simpering demeanour had given place to a hard fury that made her broad, flabby face look oddly sinister
[25464]544   Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror
[25465]3338  'Professor McGonagall got to her feet, too, and in her case this was a much more impressive move: she towered over Professor Umbridge
[25466]5774   Potter,' she said in ringing tones, I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do
[25467]466   If I have to coach you nightly, I will make sure you achieve the required results
[25468]6473  'The Minister for Magic will never employ Harry Potter
[25469]6275  ' said Umbridge, her voice rising furiously
[25470]1551   There may well be a new Minister for Magic by the time Potter is ready to join
[25471]1141  ' shouted Professor McGonagall
[25472]5   Aha
[25473]1722   shrieked Professor Umbridge, pointing a stubby linger at McGonagall
[25474]292    Yes
[25475]876   Yes, yes, yes
[25476]217   Of course
[25477]7769   That's what you want, isn't it, Minerva McGonagall
[25478]1426   You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore
[25479]4168   You think you'll be where I am, don't you: Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and Headmistress to boot
[25480]6097  'You are raving,' said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful
[25481]475    Potter, that concludes our careers consultation
[25482]8271   'Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room, not daring to look at Professor Umbridge
[25483]1706    He could hear her and Professor McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor
[25484]2836   Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a race when she strode into their Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon
[25485]9550   I hope you've thought better of what you were planning to do, Harry,' Hermione whispered, the moment they had opened their books to Chapter Thirty-four, Non-Retaliation and Negotiation'
[25486]6555    Umbridge looks like she's in a really bad mood already 
[25487]0   
[25488]0   
[25489]7947   'Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry, who kept his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes unfocused, thinking

[25492]12993   He could just imagine Professor McGonagall's reaction if he was caught trespassing in Professor Umbridge's office mere hours after she had vouched for him 
[25493]0   
[25494]0   
[25495]2450    there was nothing to stop him simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that some time during the next summer holidays he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the Pensieve 
[25496]0   
[25497]0   
[25498]1048    nothing, except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach 
[25499]0   
[25500]0   
[25501]6869    and then there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father's old Invisibility Cloak
[25502]217   But the fact remained that if he was caught 
[25503]0   
[25504]0   
[25505]6775   Dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school, Harry
[25506]2951  ' whispered Hermione, raising her book to hide her face from Umbridge
[25507]95    And if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing
[25508]5492  'He could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a summer's day more than twenty years ago 
[25509]0   
[25510]0   
[25511]1468   And then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffindor common room 
[25512]0   
[25513]0   
[25514]1217   You're less like your father than I thought 
[25515]0   
[25516]0   
[25517]813    the risk would've been what made it fun for James 
[25518]0   
[25519]0   
[25520]1831   But did he want to be like his father any more
[25521]11614  Harry, don't do it, please don't do it
[25522]7177  ' Hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class
[25523]2178   He did not answer; he did not know what to do
[25524]21936   Ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice; he would not look at Harry, though when Hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading Harry some more, he said in a low voice, Give it a rest, OK
[25525]355   He can make up his own mind
[25526]10988   'Harry's heart beat very fast as he left the classroom
[25527]1130    He was halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakeable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance
[25528]7872    There were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them; people exiting the classrooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully-Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her
[25529]650    Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the opposite direction: it was now or never
[25530]5732   Harry-please
[25531]1641  ' Hermione pleaded weakly
[25532]884   But he had made up his mind; hitching his bag more securely on to his shoulder, he set off at a run, weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing
[25533]11504   Harry reached the corridor to Umbridge's office and found it deserted
[25534]6434    Dashing behind a large suit of armour whose helmet creaked around to watch him, he pulled open his bag, seized Sirius's knife and donned the Invisibility Cloak
[25535]6283    He then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armour and along the corridor until he reached Umbridge's door
[25536]282   He inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down, then withdrew it
[25537]860    There was a tiny click, and the door swung open
[25538]1822    He ducked inside the office, closed the door quickly behind him and looked around
[25539]338   Nothing was moving except the horrible kittens that were still frolicking on the wall plates above the confiscated broomsticks
[25540]6953   Harry pulled off his Cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found what he was looking for within seconds: a small box containing glittering Floo powder
[25541]286   He crouched down in front of the empty grate, his hands shaking
[25542]769    He had never done this before, though he thought he knew how it must work
[25543]1114    Sticking his head into the fireplace, he took a large pinch of powder and dropped it on to the logs stacked neatly beneath him
[25544]136    They exploded at once into emerald green flames
[25545]291   Number twelve, Grimmauld Place
[25546]11025  ' Harry said loudly and clearly
[25547]25   It was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced
[25548]493    He had travelled by Floo powder before, of course, but then it had been his entire body that had spun around and around in the flames through the network of wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country
[25549]7022    This time, his knees remained firm upon the cold floor of Umbridge's office, and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire 
[25550]0   
[25551]0   
[25552]171   And then, as abruptly as it had begun, the spinning stopped
[25553]8909    Feeling rather sick and as though he were wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head, Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment
[25554]647   Sirius
[25555]842  'The man jumped and looked around
[25556]811    It was not Sirius, but Lupin
[25557]5732   Harry
[25558]5745  ' he said, looking thoroughly shocked
[25559]5450    What are you-what's happened, is everything all right
[25560]11095  'Yeah,' said Harry
[25561]2553    I just wondered-I mean, I just fancied a-a chat with Sirius
[25562]7642   'I'll call him,' said Lupin, getting to his feet, still looking perplexed, he went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding in the attic again 
[25563]0   
[25564]0   
[25565]6342   'And Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen
[25566]1132    Now he was left with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs
[25567]6751    He wondered why Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the fire; his knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged contact with Umbridge's hard stone floor
[25568]1037   Lupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later
[25569]0   What is it
[25570]12997  ' said Sirius urgently, sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire, so that he and Harry were on a level
[25571]786    Lupin knelt down too, looking very concerned
[25572]557    Are you all right
[25573]328   Do you need help
[25574]16302  'No,' said Harry, it's nothing like that 
[25575]0   
[25576]0   
[25577]1101    I just wanted to talk 
[25578]0   
[25579]0   
[25580]110    about my dad
[25581]8786   'They exchanged a look of great surprise, but Harry did not have time to feel awkward or embarrassed; his knees were becoming sorer by the second and he guessed five minutes had already passed from the start of the diversion; George had only guaranteed him twenty
[25582]329    He therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen in the Pensieve
[25583]1211   When he had finished, neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a moment
[25584]14698    Then Lupin said quietly, I wouldn't like you to judge your father on what you saw there, Harry
[25585]11265    He was only fifteen-'I'm fifteen,' said Harry heatedly
[25586]16710   Look, Harry' said Sirius placatingly, James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can't you
[25587]2162   I think James was everything Snape wanted to be-he was popular, he was good at Quidditch-good at pretty much everything
[25588]8722    And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts, and James-whatever else he may have appeared to you, Harry-always hated the Dark Arts
[25589]20379   'Yeah,' said Harry, but he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because-well, just because you said you were bored,' he finished, with a slightly apologetic note in his voice
[25590]6342   I m not proud of it,' said Sirius quickly
[25591]23960   Lupin looked sideways at Sirius, then said, Look, Harry, what you've got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did- everyone thought they were the height of cool-if they sometimes got a bit carried away-'If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,' said Sirius
[25592]199   Lupin smiled
[25593]11649   He kept messing up his hair,' said Harry in a pained voice
[25594]863   Sirius and Lupin laughed
[25595]6468   I'd forgotten he used to do that,' said Sirius affectionately
[25596]88   Was he playing with the Snitch
[25597]5301  ' said Lupin eagerly
[25598]12071   Yeah,' said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and Lupin beamed reminiscently
[25599]0    Well 
[25600]0   
[25601]0   
[25602]594    I thought he was a bit of an idiot
[25603]423   'Of course he was a bit of an idiot
[25604]5749  ' said Sirius bracingly, we were all idiots
[25605]5865   Well- not Moony so much,' he said fairly, looking at Lupin
[25606]720   But Lupin shook his head
[25607]1558    Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape
[25608]5086  ' he said
[25609]1543    Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order
[25610]6148  'Yeah, well,' said Sirius, you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes 
[25611]0   
[25612]0   
[25613]0    that was something 
[25614]0   
[25615]0   
[25616]12222   'And,' said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here, he kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching him
[25617]9469  'Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was around,' said Sirius, shrugging, he couldn't stop himself showing off whenever he got near her
[25618]441   'How come she married him
[25619]6113  ' Harry asked miserably
[25620]12    She hated him
[25621]8449  'Nah, she didn't,' said Sirius
[25622]6053   She started going out with him in seventh year,' said Lupin
[25623]6498   Once James had deflated his head a bit,' said Sirius
[25624]6513   And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,' said Lupin
[25625]480   Even Snape
[25626]10818  ' said Harry
[25627]5942   Well,' said Lupin slowly, Snape was a special case
[25628]3369    I mean, he never lost an opportunity to curse James so you couldn't really expect James to take that lying down, could you
[25629]161  'And my mum was OK with that
[25630]9585  'She didn't know too much about it, to tell you the truth,' said Sirius
[25631]4193    I mean, James didn't take Snape on dates with her and jinx him in front of her, did he
[25632]6996  'Sirius frowned at Harry, who was still looking unconvinced
[25633]6212   Look,' he said, your father was the best friend I ever had and he was a good person
[25634]438    A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen
[25635]27    He grew out of it
[25636]11225   'Yeah, OK,' said Harry heavily
[25637]2518    I just never thought I'd feel sorry for Snape
[25638]7313   'Now you mention it,' said Lupin, a faint crease between his eyebrows, how did Snape react when he found you'd seen all this
[25639]17381  'He told me he'd never teach me Occlumency again,' said Harry indifferently, like that's a big disappoint-'He WHAT
[25640]6575  ' shouted Sirius, causing Harry to jump and inhale a mouthful of ashes
[25641]5732   Are you serious, Harry
[25642]5405  ' said Lupin quickly
[25643]5000    He's stopped giving you lessons
[25644]11419  'Yeah,' said Harry, surprised at what he considered a great over-reaction
[25645]14264    But it's OK, I don't care, it's a bit of a relief to tell you the-'I'm coming up there to have a word with Snape
[25646]6048  ' said Sirius forcefully, and he actually made to stand up, but Lupin wrenched him back down again
[25647]6051   If anyone's going to tell Snape it will be me
[25648]5131  ' he said firmly
[25649]10986    But Harry, first of all, you're to go back to Snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessons-when Dumbledore hears-'I can't tell him that, he'd kill me
[25650]10827  ' said Harry, outraged
[25651]3424    You didn't see him when we got out of the Pensieve
[25652]5834   'Harry there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency
[25653]5261  ' said Lupin sternly
[25654]88    Do you understand me
[25655]0   Nothing
[25656]11058  'OK, OK,' said Harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention annoyed
[25657]567    I'll 
[25658]0   
[25659]0   
[25660]923    I'll try and say something to him 
[25661]0   
[25662]0   
[25663]2644    but it won't be-'He fell silent
[25664]268    He could hear distant footsteps
[25665]255   Is that Kreacher coming downstairs
[25666]5760  'No,' said Sirius, glancing behind him
[25667]273    It must be somebody your end
[25668]10584   'Harry's heart skipped several beats
[25669]804   I'd better go
[25670]6054  ' he said hastily and pulled his head backwards out of the Grimmauld Place fire
[25671]6376    For a moment his head seemed to be revolving on his shoulders, then he found himself kneeling in front of Umbridge's fire with it firmly back on and watching the emerald flames flicker and die
[25672]310   Quickly, quickly
[25673]2172  ' he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door
[25674]12447    Ah, she's left it open-'Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when Filch burst into the office
[25675]7563    He looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room, pulled open a drawer in Umbridge's desk and began rifling through the papers inside it

[25679]18    Approval for Whipping

[25682]0    I can do it at last 
[25683]0   
[25684]0   
[25685]966    they've had it coming to them for years 
[25686]0   
[25687]0   
[25688]958   'He pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly back out of the door, clutching it to his chest
[25689]13673   Harry leapt to his feet and, making sure he had his bag and that the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling along faster than Harry had ever seen him go
[25690]11696   One landing down from Umbridge's office, Harry thought it was safe to become visible again
[25691]423    He pulled off the Cloak, shoved it in his bag and hurried onwards
[25692]733    There was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the Entrance Hall
[25693]1784    He ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there
[25694]1830   It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked
[25695]8084    Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them, Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap); teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd
[25696]3742    Prominent among the onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves, and Peeves, who was bobbing overhead, gazed down at Fred and George who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakeable look of two people who had just been cornered
[25697]0   So
[25698]5662  ' said Umbridge triumphantly
[25699]7421    Harry realised she was standing just a few stairs in front of him, once more looking down upon her prey
[25700]993    So-you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp, do you
[25701]6547  'Pretty amusing, yeah,' said Fred, looking up at her without the slightest sign of fear
[25702]1119   Filch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with happiness
[25703]13566   I've got the form, Headmistress,' he said hoarsely, waving the piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk
[25704]2879    I've got the form and I've got the whips waiting 
[25705]0   
[25706]0   
[25707]682    oh, let me do it now 
[25708]0   
[25709]0   
[25710]5441   'Very good, Argus,' she said
[25711]1321    You two,' she went on, gazing down at Fred and George, are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school
[25712]771   'You know what
[25713]5514  ' said Fred
[25714]3503    I don't think we are
[25715]339   'He turned to his twin
[25716]7706   George,' said Fred, I think we've outgrown full-time education
[25717]6965   'Yeah, I've been feeling that way myself,' said George lightly
[25718]1358   Time to test our talents in the real world, d'you reckon
[25719]784  ' asked Fred
[25720]5492   Definitely,' said George
[25721]6201   And before Umbridge could say a word, they raised their wands and said together:Accio brooms
[25722]6140  'Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance
[25723]2267    Looking to his left, he ducked just in time
[25724]7924    Fred and George's broomsticks, one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor towards their owners; they turned left, streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor
[25725]4638   We won't be seeing you,' Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his leg over his broomstick
[25726]8738   Yeah, don't bother to keep in touch,' said George, mounting his own
[25727]1407   Fred looked around at the assembled students, at the silent, watchful crowd
[25728]11767   It anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated upstairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley-Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes,' he said in a loud voice
[25729]147    Our new premises
[25730]7665  'Special discounts to Hogwart's students who swear they're going to use our products to get rid of this old bat,' added George, pointing at Professor Umbridge
[25731]133   STOP THEM
[25732]644  ' shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late
[25733]1700    As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously below
[25734]1444    Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd
[25735]60   Give her hell from us, Peeves
[25736]8165   'And Peeves, who Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset

[25753]716    Lionfish 11/Nov/2007     Chapter Thirty     GrawpContents  Prev Chapter  Next Chapter  
[25754]18031     The story of Fred and George's flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of Hogwart's legend: within a week, even those who had been eye-witnesses were half-convinced they had seen the twins dive-bomb Umbridge on their brooms and pelt her with Dungbombs before zooming out of the doors
[25755]419    In the immediate aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them
[25756]11451    Harry frequently heard students saying things like, Honestly, some days I just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this place,' or else, One more lesson like that and I might just do a Weasley
[25757]1153   'Fred and George had made sure nobody was likely to forget them too soon
[25758]1017    For one thing, they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing
[25759]1014    Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different means of removing it but without success
[25760]460    Eventually, the area was roped off and Filch, gnashing his teeth furiously, was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms
[25761]13988    Harry was certain that teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant but, just as in the case of Fred and George's Wildfire Whiz-bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle
[25762]11885   Then there were the two large broom-shaped holes in Umbridge's office door, through which Fred and George's Cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters
[25763]12044    Filch fitted a new door and removed Harry's Firebolt to the dungeons where, it was rumoured, Umbridge had set an armed security troll to guard it
[25764]143    However, her troubles were far from over
[25765]6055   Inspired by Fred and George's example, a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of Troublemakers-in-Chief
[25766]7475    In spite of the new door, somebody managed to slip a hairy-snouted Niffler into Umbridge's office, which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects, leapt on Umbridge when she entered and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers
[25767]1716    Dungbombs and Stink Pellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform Bubble-Head Charms on themselves before leaving lessons, which ensured them a supply of fresh air, even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing upside-down goldfish bowls on their heads
[25768]1216   Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands, desperate to catch miscreants, but the problem was that there were now so many of them he never knew which way to turn
[25769]566    The Inquisitorial Squad was attempting to help him, but odd things kept happening to its members
[25770]7781    Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes; Pansy Parkinson, to Hermione's delight, missed all her lessons the following day as she had sprouted antlers
[25771]2076   Meanwhile, it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred and George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts
[25772]969    Umbridge only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to faint, vomit, develop dangerous fevers or else spout blood from both nostrils
[25773]1161    Shrieking with rage and frustration, she attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their source, but the students told her stubbornly they were suffering from Umbridge-itis'
[25774]534    After putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret, she was forced to give up and allow the bleeding, swooning, sweating and vomiting students to leave her classes in droves
[25775]5606   But not even the users of the Snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos, Peeves, who seemed to have taken Fred's parting words deeply to heart
[25776]833    Cackling madly, he soared through the school, upending tables, bursting out of blackboards, toppling statues and vases; twice he shut Mrs
[25777]423    Norris inside a suit of armour, from which she was rescued, yowling loudly, by the furious caretaker
[25778]3959    Peeves smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles, juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students, caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows; flooded the second floor when he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms, dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and, whenever he fancied a break, spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke
[25779]301   None of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help her
[25780]14466    Indeed, a week after Fred and George's departure Harry witnessed Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves, who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier, and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, It unscrews the other way
[25781]1073   'To cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet; he remained confused and disorientated and his parents were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive, looking extremely angry
[25782]270   Should we say something
[25783]7884  ' said Hermione in a worried voice, pressing her cheek against the Charms window so that she could see Mr
[25784]369    and Mrs
[25785]238    Montague marching inside
[25786]143    About what happened to him
[25787]210   In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him
[25788]7879  'Course not, he'll recover,' said Ron indifferently
[25789]3048   Anyway, more trouble for Umbridge, isn't it
[25790]11376  ' said Harry in a satisfied voice
[25791]2159   He and Ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be charming with their wands
[25792]10825    Harry's spouted four very short legs that could not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair
[25793]7508    Ron's grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with great difficulty, trembled for a few seconds, then folded, causing the cup to crack into two
[25794]14074   Reparo,' said Hermione quickly, mending Ron's cup with a wave of her wand
[25795]9545    That's all very well, but what if Montague's permanently injured
[25796]9  'Who cares
[25797]7365  ' said Ron irritably, while his teacup stood up drunkenly again, trembling violently at the knees
[25798]2725    Montague shouldn't have tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should he
[25799]2040   If you want to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me
[25800]0  'You
[25801]6015  ' she said, catching her teacup as it scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little willow-patterned legs, and replacing it in front of her
[25802]47    Why should I be worried about you
[25803]18896  'When Mum's next letter finally gets through Umbridge's screening process,' said Ron bitterly, now holding his cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight, I'm going to be in deep trouble
[25804]7304    I wouldn't be surprised if she's sent another Howler
[25805]8864   'But-'It'll be my fault Fred and George left, you wait,' said Ron darkly
[25806]2510    She'll say I should've stopped them leaving, I should've grabbed the ends of their brooms and hung on or something 
[25807]0   
[25808]0   
[25809]871    yeah, it'll be all my fault
[25810]8031   'Well, if she doe's say that it'll be very unfair, you couldn't have done anything
[25811]9906   But I'm sure she won't, I mean, if it's really true they've got premises in Diagon Alley, they must have been planning this for ages
[25812]5885   'Yeah, but that's another thing, how did they get premises
[25813]7871  ' said Ron, hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay twitching before him
[25814]7359    It's a bit dodgy, isn't it
[25815]1033   They'll need loads of Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley
[25816]2672    She'll want to know what they've been up to, to get their hands on that sort of gold
[25817]19100   'Well, yes, that occurred to me, too,' said Hermione, allowing her teacup to jog in neat little circles around Harry's, whose stubby little legs were still unable to touch the desktop, I've been wondering whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful
[25818]13193   'He hasn't,' said Harry curtly
[25819]771   How do you know
[25820]8703  ' said Ron and Hermione together
[25821]6520   Because-' Harry hesitated, but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come
[25822]1311    There was no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant anyone suspected that Fred and George were criminals
[25823]751    Because they got the gold from me
[25824]251    I gave them my Triwizard winnings last June
[25825]7524   'There was a shocked silence, then Hermione's teacup jogged right over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor
[25826]8802   Oh, Harry, you didn't
[25827]5086  ' she said
[25828]11778   Yes, I did,' said Harry mutinously
[25829]2952    And I don't regret it, either
[25830]3903    I didn't need the gold and they'll be great at running a joke shop
[25831]35   'But this is excellent
[25832]7697  ' said Ron, looking thrilled
[25833]12914    It's all your fault, Harry-Mum can't blame me at all
[25834]332   Can I tell her
[25835]12065  'Yeah, I suppose you'd better,' said Harry dully, ' specially if she thinks they're receiving stolen cauldrons or something
[25836]13061   'Hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson, but Harry had a shrewd suspicion that her self-restraint was bound to crack before long
[25837]7284    Sure enough, once they had left the castle for break and were standing around in the weak May sunshine, she fixed Harry with a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air
[25838]5870   Harry interrupted her before she had even started
[25839]14979   It's no good nagging me, it's done,' he said firmly
[25840]7752    Fred and George have got the gold- spent a good bit of it, too, by the sounds of it-and I can't get it back from them and I don't want to
[25841]1744    So save your breath, Hermione
[25842]4014   'I wasn't going to say anything about Fred and George
[25843]5640  ' she said in an injured voice
[25844]4180   Ron snorted disbelievingly and Hermione threw him a very dirty look
[25845]2449   No, I wasn't
[25846]5169  ' she said angrily
[25847]12423    As a matter of fact, I was going to ask Harry when he's going to go back to Snape and ask for more Occlumency lessons
[25848]10621  ' Harry's heart sank
[25849]10443    Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred and George's dramatic departure, which admittedly had taken many hours, Ron and Hermione had wanted to hear news of Sirius
[25850]14749    As Harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to Sirius in the first place, it had been hard to think of what to tell them; he had ended up saying, truthfully, that Sirius wanted Harry to resume Occlumency lessons
[25851]7892    He had been regretting this ever since; Hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when Harry least expected it
[25852]12937   You can't tell me you've stopped having funny dreams,' Hermione said now, because Ron told me you were muttering in your sleep again last night
[25853]8285   'Harry threw Ron a furious look
[25854]2473    Ron had the grace to look ashamed of himself
[25855]265   You were only muttering a bit,' he mumbled apologetically
[25856]1002    Something about just a bit further"
[25857]6165   'I dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch,' Harry lied brutally
[25858]487    I was trying to get you to stretch out a bit further to grab the Quaffle
[25859]7131   'Ron's ears went red
[25860]6422    Harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure; he had not, of course, dreamed anything of the sort
[25861]448   Last night, he had once again made the journey along the Department of Mysteries corridor
[25862]2024    He had passed through the circular room, then the room full of clicking and dancing light, until he found himself again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were ranged dusty glass spheres
[25863]1018   He had hurried straight towards row number ninety-seven, turned left and run along it 
[25864]0   
[25865]0   
[25866]104    it had probably been then that he had spoken aloud 
[25867]0   
[25868]0   
[25869]1002    just a bit further 
[25870]0   
[25871]0   
[25872]362    for he felt his conscious self struggling to wake 
[25873]0   
[25874]0   
[25875]735    and before he had reached the end of the row, he had found himself lying in bed again, gazing up at the canopy of his four-poster
[25876]2755   You are trying to block your mind, aren't you
[25877]5086  ' said
[25878]7954    Hermione, looking beadily at Harry
[25879]566    You are keeping going with your Occlumency
[25880]11836  'Of course I am,' said Harry, trying to sound as though this question was insulting, but not quite meeting her eye
[25881]837    The truth was he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full of dusty orbs, that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue
[25882]2757   The problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to revision, his mind seemed so saturated with information when he went to bed he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all; and when he did, his overwrought brain presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams
[25883]13361    He also suspected that part of his mind-the part that often spoke in Hermione's voice-now felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door, and sought to wake him before he could reach the journey's end
[25884]10798   You know,' said Ron, whose ears were still flaming red, if Montague doesn't recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup
[25885]15960   'Yeah, I s'pose so,' said Harry, glad of a change of subject
[25886]17769   I mean, we've won one, lost one-if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next Saturday-'Yeah, that's right,' said Harry, losing track of what he was agreeing to
[25887]1749    Cho Chang had just walked across the courtyard, determinedly not looking at him
[25888]648   The final match of the Quidditch season, Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw, was to take place on the last weekend of May
[25889]12658    Although Slytherin had been narrowly defeated by Hufflepuff in their last match, Gryffindor were not daring to hope for victory, due mainly (though of course nobody said it to him) to Ron's abysmal goal-keeping record
[25890]142    He, however, seemed to have found a new optimism
[25891]2595   I mean, I can't get any worse, can I
[25892]7892  ' he told Harry and Hermione grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match
[25893]12    Nothing to lose now, is there
[25894]17485  ' You know,' said Hermione, as she and Harry walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd, I think Ron might do better without Fred and George around
[25895]430    They never exactly gave him a lot of confidence
[25896]803   'Luna Lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her head
[25897]384   Oh, gosh, I forgot
[25898]7546  ' said Hermione, watching the eagle flapping its wings as Luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing Slytherins
[25899]2633    Cho will be playing, won't she
[25900]5839  'Harry, who had not forgotten this, merely grunted
[25901]97   They found seats in the topmost row of the stands
[25902]11040    It was a fine, ckar day; Ron could not wish for better, and Harry found himself hoping against hope that Ron would not give the Slytherins cause for more rousing choruses of Weasley is our King'
[25903]1232   Lee Jordan, who had been very dispirited since Fred and George had left, was commentating as usual
[25904]221    As the teams zoomed out on to the pitch he named the players with something less than his usual gusto
[25905]0   
[25906]0   
[25907]0   
[25908]2    Bradley 
[25909]0

[25911]15    Davies 
[25912]0   
[25913]0   
[25914]12020    Chang,' he said, and Harry felt his stomach perform, less of a back flip, more a feeble lurch as Cho walked out on to the pitch, her shiny black hair rippling in the slight breeze
[25915]526   He was not sure what he wanted to happen any more, except that he could not stand any more rows
[25916]225    Even the sight of her chatting animatedly to Roger Davies as they prepared to mount their brooms caused him only a slight twinge of jealousy
[25917]0   And they're off
[25918]5123  ' said Lee
[25919]305    And Davies takes the Quaffle immediately, Ravenclaw Captain Davies with the Quaffle, he dodges Johnson, he dodges Bell, he dodges Spinnet as well 
[25920]0   
[25921]0   
[25922]5352    he's going straight for goal
[25923]5422   He's going to shoot-and-and-' Lee swore very loudly
[25924]4752    And he's scored
[25925]7500   'Harry and Hermione groaned with the rest of the Gryffindors
[25926]947    Predictably, horribly the Slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing:Weasley cannot save a thingHe cannot block a single ring 
[25927]0   
[25928]0   
[25929]21909    'Harry,' said a hoarse voice in Harry's ear
[25930]1615    Hermione 
[25931]0   
[25932]0   
[25933]12886   'Harry looked round and saw Hagrid's enormous bearded face sticking between the seats
[25934]2193    Apparently, he had squeezed his way all along the row behind, for the first- and second-years he had just passed had a ruffled, flattened look about them
[25935]1283    For some reason, Hagrid was bent double as though anxious not to be seen, though he was still at least four feet taller than everybody else
[25936]764   Listen,' he whispered, can yeh come with me
[25937]0   Now
[25938]4808   While ev'ryone's watchin' the match
[25939]121  'Er 
[25940]0   
[25941]0   
[25942]3037    can't it wait, Hagrid

[25944]66    Till the match is over
[25945]5738  'No,' said Hagrid
[25946]10489    No, Harry, it's gotta be now 
[25947]0   
[25948]0

[25953]5646  'Hagrid's nose was gently dripping blood
[25954]486    His eyes were both blackened
[25955]6982    Harry had not seen him this close-up since his return to the school; he looked utterly woebegone
[25956]12255   Course,' said Harry at once, course we'll come
[25957]1945   'He and Hermione edged back along their row of seats, causing much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them
[25958]6216    The people in Hagrid's row were not complaining, merely attempting to make themselves as small as possible
[25959]6233   I ppreciate this, you two, I really do,' said Hagrid as they reached the stairs
[25960]800    He kept looking around nervously as they descended towards the lawn below
[25961]242    I jus' hope she doesn' notice us goin'
[25962]802   'You mean Umbridge
[25963]10818  ' said Harry
[25964]10744    She won't, she's got her whole Inquisitorial Squad sitting with her, didn't you see
[25965]138   She must be expecting trouble at the match
[25966]7182   'Yeah, well, a bit o' trouble wouldn' hurt,' said Hagrid, pausing to peer around the edge of the stands to make sure the stretch of lawn between there and his cabin was deserted
[25967]556    Give us more time
[25968]652   'What is it, Hagrid
[25969]8169  ' said Hermione, looking up at him with a concerned expression on her face as they hurried across the grass towards the edge of the Forest
[25970]7621   Yeh-yeh'll see in a mo',' said Hagrid, looking over his shoulder as a great roar rose from the stands behind them
[25971]729    Hey-did someone jus' score
[25972]11466  ' It'll be Ravenclaw,' said Harry heavily
[25973]343   Good 
[25974]0   
[25975]0   
[25976]343    good 
[25977]0

[25980]5122    Tha's good 
[25981]0   
[25982]0   
[25983]719   'They had to jog to keep up with him as he strode across the lawn, looking around with every other step
[25984]2908    When they reached his cabin, Hermione turned automatically left towards the front door
[25985]1418    Hagrid, however, walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the Forest, where he picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree
[25986]441    When he realised they were no longer with him, he turned
[25987]5599   We're goin' in here,' he said, jerking his shaggy head behind him
[25988]110   Into the Forest
[25989]6709  ' said Hermione, perplexed
[25990]6015   Yeah,' said Hagrid
[25991]125    C'mon now, quick, before we're spotted
[25992]9383  'Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then ducked into the cover of the trees behind Hagrid, who was already striding away from them into the green gloom, his crossbow over his arm
[25993]7457    Harry and Hermione ran to catch up with him
[25994]658   Hagrid, why are you armed
[25995]10818  ' said Harry
[25996]5846   Jus' a precaution,' said Hagrid, shrugging his massive shoulders
[25997]9667   You didn't bring your crossbow the day you showed us the Thestrals,' said Hermione timidly
[25998]5941   Nah, well, we weren' goin' in so far then,' said Hagrid
[25999]601    An' anyway, tha' was before Firenze left the Forest, wasn' it
[26000]419  'Why does Firenze leaving make a difference
[26001]1987  ' asked Hermione curiously
[26002]11092   ' Cause the other centaurs are good an' riled at me, tha's why,' said Hagrid quietly, glancing around
[26003]1250    They used ter be-well, yeh couldn' call em friendly-but we got on all righ'
[26004]716    Kept emselves to emselves, bu' always turned up if I wanted a word
[26005]0    Not any more
[26006]60   'He sighed deeply
[26007]22729   Firenze said they're angry because he went to work for Dumbledore,' Harry said, tripping on a protruding root because he was busy watching Hagrid's profile
[26008]6063   Yeah,' said Hagrid heavily
[26009]213    Well, angry doesn' cover it
[26010]22    Ruddy livid
[26011]1972    If I hadn' stepped in, I reckon they'd've kicked Firenze ter death-'They attacked him
[26012]6768  ' said Hermione, sounding shocked
[26013]6270   Yep,' said Hagrid gruffly, forcing his way through several low-hanging branches
[26014]183    He had half the herd on to him
[26015]120   'And you stopped it
[26016]10843  ' said Harry, amazed and impressed
[26017]0    By yourself
[26018]3608  'Course I did, couldn't stand by an' watch em kill im, could I
[26019]5738  ' said Hagrid
[26020]313    Lucky I was passin', really 
[26021]0   
[26022]0   
[26023]6762    an' I'd've thought Firenze mighta remembered tha' before he started sendin' me stupid warnin's
[26024]108  ' he added hotly and unexpectedly
[26025]9361   Harry and Hermione looked at each other, startled, but Hagrid, scowling, did not elaborate
[26026]7892   Anyway,' he said, breathing a little more heavily than usud, since then the other centaurs've bin livid with me, an' the trouble is they've got a lot of influence in the Forest 
[26027]0   
[26028]0   
[26029]52    cleverest creatures in here
[26030]652   'Is that why we're here, Hagrid

[26032]40    The centaurs
[26033]11131  'Ah, no,' said Hagrid, shaking his head dismissively, no, it's not them
[26034]636    Well, o' course, they could complicate the problem, yeah 
[26035]0   
[26036]0   
[26037]1122    but yeh'll see what I mean in a bit
[26038]1102   'On this incomprehensible note he fell silent and forged a little ahead, taking one stride for every three of theirs, so that they had great trouble keeping up with him
[26039]765   The path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew so closely together as they walked further and further into the Forest that it was as dark as dusk
[26040]9510    They were soon a long way past the clearing where Hagrid had shown them the Thestrals, but Harry felt no sense of unease until Hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of trees towards the dark heart of the Forest
[26041]652   Hagrid
[26042]12300  ' said Harry, fighting his way through thickly knotted brambles, over which Hagrid had stepped with ease, and remembering very vividly what had happened to him on the other occasion he had stepped off the Forest path
[26043]489    Where are we going
[26044]6046  'Bit further,' said Hagrid over his shoulder
[26045]5791    C'mon, Harry 
[26046]0   
[26047]0   
[26048]330    we need ter keep together now
[26049]14763   'It was a great struggle to keep up with Hagrid, what with branches and thickets of thorn through which Hagrid marched as easily as if they were cobwebs, but which snagged Harry and Hermione's robes, frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a time to free themselves
[26050]10940    Harry's arms and legs were soon covered in small cuts and scratches
[26051]6982    They were so deep in the Forest now that sometimes all Harry could see of Hagrid in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of him
[26052]216    Any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence
[26053]6033    The breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement, even though it might have been made by an innocent sparrow, caused Harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit
[26054]555    It occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the Forest without meeting some kind of creature; their absence struck him as rather ominous
[26055]1288   Hagrid, would it be all right if we lit our wands
[26056]6838  ' said Hermione quietly
[26057]121   Er 
[26058]0   
[26059]0   
[26060]800    all righ',' Hagrid whispered back
[26061]3050    In fact-'He stopped suddenly and turned around; Hermione walked right into him and was knocked over backwards
[26062]7114    Harry caught her just before she hit the Forest floor
[26063]280   Maybe we bes' jus' stop fer a momen', so I can 
[26064]0   
[26065]0   
[26066]5868    fill yeh in,' said Hagrid
[26067]735    Before we ge' there, like
[26068]343   'Good
[26069]12811  ' said Hermione, as Harry set her back on her feet
[26070]19    They both murmured Lumos
[26071]426  ' and their wand-tips ignited
[26072]12863    Hagrid's face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and Harry saw again that he looked nervous and sad
[26073]5763   Righ',' said Hagrid

[26083]557   'He took a great breath
[26084]11011   Well, there's a good chance I'm goin' ter be gettin' the sack any day now,' he said
[26085]8023   Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then back at him
[26086]7764   But you've lasted this long-' Hermione said tentatively
[26087]1373    What makes you think-'Umbridge reckons it was me that put tha' Niffler in her office
[26088]0   'And was it
[26089]10951  ' said Harry, before he could stop himself
[26090]153   No, it ruddy well wasn'
[26091]5755  ' said Hagrid indignantly
[26092]5957    On'y any-thin' ter do with magical creatures an' she thinks it's got somethin' ter do with me
[26093]6661    Yeh know she's bin lookin' fer a chance ter get rid of me ever since I got back
[26094]1295    I don' wan' ter go, o' course, but if it wasn' fer

[26100]8352    the special circumstances I'm abou' ter explain to yeh, I'd leave righ' now, before she's go' the chance ter do it in front o' the whole school, like she did with Trelawney
[26101]8273   'Harry and Hermione both made noises of protest, but Hagrid overrode them with a wave of one of his enormous hands
[26102]7710   It's not the end o' the world, I'll be able ter help Dumbledore once I'm outta here, I can be useful ter the Order
[26103]2258    An you lot'll have Grubbly-Plank, yeh'll-yeh'll get through yer exams fine

[26105]0   
[26106]594   'His voice trembled and broke
[26107]7553   Don' worry abou' me,' he said hastily, as Hermione made to pat his arm
[26108]788    He pulled his enormous spotted handkerchief from the pocket of his waistcoat and mopped his eyes with it
[26109]1143    Look, I wouldn' be tellin' yer this at all if I didn' have ter
[26110]0    See, if I go

[26121]11747   'Of course we'll help you,' said Harry at once
[26122]335    What do you want us to do
[26123]12907  ' Hagrid gave a great sniff and patted Harry wordlessly on the shoulder with such force Harry was knocked sideways into a tree
[26124]7472   I knew yeh'd say yes,' said Hagrid into his handkerchief, but I won'

[26142]4835    watch yerselves, now, there's nettles 
[26143]0   
[26144]0   
[26145]8071   'They walked on in silence for another fifteen minutes; Harry had opened his mouth to ask how much further they had to go when Hagrid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop
[26146]5444   Really easy,' he said softly
[26147]41    Very quiet, now 
[26148]0   
[26149]0   
[26150]7931   'They crept forwards and Harry saw that they were facing a large, smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as Hagrid that he thought, with a jolt of dread, was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal
[26151]8716    Trees had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound, so that it stood on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs that formed a kind of fence or barricade, behind which Harry, Hermione and Hagrid now stood
[26152]678   Sleepin',' breathed Hagrid
[26153]7204   Sure enough, Harry could hear a distant, rhythmic rumbling that sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work
[26154]2379    He glanced sideways at Hermione, who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly open
[26155]719    She looked utterly terrified
[26156]5986   Hagrid,' she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature, who is he
[26157]5841  'Harry found this an odd question 
[26158]0   
[26159]0   
[26160]0    What is it
[26161]57  ' was the one he; had been planning on asking
[26162]9467   Hagrid, you told us-' said Hermione, her wand now shaking in her hand, you told us none of them wanted to come
[26163]8029  'Harry looked from her to Hagrid and then, as realisation hit him, he looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror
[26164]3639   The great mound of earth, on which he, Hermione and Hagrid could easily have stood, was moving slowly up and down in time with the deep, grunting breathing
[26165]8    It was not a mound at all
[26166]7188    It was the curved back of what was clearly-' Well-no-he didn' want ter come,' said Hagrid, sounding desperate
[26167]1942    But I had ter bring him, Hermione, I had ter
[26168]0  'But why
[26169]2199  ' asked Hermione, who sounded as though she wanted to cry
[26170]1014    Why-what-oh, Hagrid
[26171]12722  'I knew if I jus' got him back,' said Hagrid, sounding close to tears himself, an'-an' taught him a few manners-I'd be able ter take him outside an' show ev'ryone he's harmless
[26172]3  'Harmless
[26173]7856  ' said Hermione shrilly, and Hagrid made frantic hushing noises with his hands as the enormous creature before them grunted loudly and shifted in its sleep
[26174]7677    He's been hurting you all this time, hasn't he
[26175]5456   That's why you've had all these injuries
[26176]1414  'He don' know his own strength
[26177]5747  ' said Hagrid earnestly
[26178]10030    An' he's gettin' better, he's not fightin' so much any more-'So, this is why it took you two months to get home
[26179]6710  ' said Hermione distractedly
[26180]5193    Oh, Hagrid, why did you bring him back if he didn't want to come
[26181]2743   Wouldn't he have been happier with his own people
[26182]6541  'They were all bullyin' him, Hermione, cause he's so small
[26183]5738  ' said Hagrid
[26184]148   Small
[26185]6701  ' said Hermione
[26186]148    Small
[26187]8205  'Hermione, I couldn' leave him,' said Hagrid, tears now trickling down his bruised face into his beard
[26188]4774    See-he's my brother
[26189]2208  'Hermione simply stared at him, her mouth open
[26190]12121   Hagrid, when you say brother",' said Harry slowly, do you mean-
[26191]853  'Well- half-brother,' amended Hagrid
[26192]1041    Turns out me mother took up with another giant when she left me dad, an' she went an' had Grawp here-'Grawp
[26193]10818  ' said Harry
[26194]277   Yeah 
[26195]0   
[26196]0   
[26197]11404    well, tha's what it sounds like when he says his name,' said Hagrid anxiously
[26198]808    He don' speak a lot of English 
[26199]0   
[26200]0   
[26201]917    I've bin tryin' ter teach him 
[26202]0   
[26203]0   
[26204]854    anyway, she don' seem ter have liked him much more'n she liked me
[26205]6271    See, with giantesses, what counts is producin' good big kids, and he's always been a bit on the runty side fer a giant-on'y sixteen foot-'Oh, yes, tiny
[26206]6797  ' said Hermione, with a kind of hysterical sarcasm
[26207]25    Absolutely minuscule
[26208]1468  'He was bein' kicked aroun' by all o' them-I jus' couldn' leave him-' Did Madame Maxime want to bring him back
[26209]6088  ' asked Harry
[26210]6680   She-well, she could see it was right importan' ter me,' said Hagrid, twisting his enormous hands
[26211]1061    Bu'-bu' she got a bit tired o' him after a while, I must admit 
[26212]0   
[26213]0   
[26214]130    so we split up on the journey home 
[26215]0   
[26216]0   
[26217]491    she promised not ter tell anyone, though 
[26218]0   
[26219]0   
[26220]715   'How on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing
[26221]10818  ' said Harry
[26222]11082   Well, tha's why it took so long, see,' said Hagrid
[26223]113    Could on'y travel by nigh' an' through wild country an' stuff
[26224]701    Course, he covers the ground pretty well when he wants ter, but he kep' wantin' ter go back
[26225]4080   'Oh, Hagrid, why on earth didn't you let him
[26226]7483  ' said Hermione, flopping down on to a ripped up tree and burying her face in her hands
[26227]3870    What do you think you're going to do with a violent giant who doesn't even want to be here
[26228]10915  'Well, now- violent"-tha's a bit harsh,' said Hagrid, still twisting his hands agitatedly
[26229]10897    I'll admit he mighta taken a couple o' swings at me when he's bin in a bad mood, but he's gettin' better, loads better, settlin' down well
[26230]8   'What are those ropes for, then
[26231]6088  ' Harry asked
[26232]1479   He had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around the trunks of the largest nearby trees towards the place where Grawp lay curled on the ground with his back to them
[26233]12   You have to keep him tied up
[26234]6718  ' said Hermione faintly
[26235]0   Well 
[26236]0   
[26237]0   
[26238]277    yeah 
[26239]0   
[26240]0   
[26241]6377   ' said Hagrid, looking anxious
[26242]6932    See-it's like I say-he doesn' really know is own strength
[26243]5945   'Harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack of any other living creature in this part of the Forest
[26244]8069   So, what is it you want Harry and Ron and me to do
[26245]1979  ' Hermione asked apprehensively
[26246]6196   Look after him,' said Hagrid croakily
[26247]570    After I'm gone
[26248]14270   'Harry and Hermione exchanged miserable looks, Harry uncomfortably aware that he had already promised Hagrid that he would do whatever he asked
[26249]193   What-what does that involve, exactly
[26250]1620  ' Hermione enquired
[26251]37   Not food or anythin'
[26252]5789  ' said Hagrid eagerly
[26253]64    He can get his own food, no problem
[26254]81    Birds an' deer an' stuff 
[26255]0   
[26256]0   
[26257]4788    no, it's company he needs
[26258]999    I xxjus' knew someone was carryin on trying ter help him a bit 
[26259]0   
[26260]0   
[26261]902    teachin' him, yeh know
[26262]11876   ' Harry said nothing, but turned to look back at the gigantic form lying asleep on the ground in front of them
[26263]2890    Unlike Hagrid, who simply looked like an oversized human, Grawp looked strangely misshapen
[26264]11684    What Harry had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound he now recognised as Grawp's head
[26265]1212    It was much larger in proportion to the body than a human head, and was almost perfectly round and covered with tightly curling, close-growing hair the colour of bracken
[26266]7085    The rim of a single large, fleshy ear was visible on top of the head, which seemed to sit, rather like Uncle Vernon's, directly upon the shoulders with little or no neck in between
[26267]1833    The back, under what looked like a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly together, was very broad; and as Grawp slept, it seemed to strain a little at the rough seams of the skins
[26268]179    The legs were curled up under the body
[26269]6660    Harry could see the soles of enormous, filthy, bare feet, large as sledges, resting one on top of the other on the earthy Forest floor
[26270]11754   You want us to teach him,' Harry said in a hollow voice
[26271]4899    He now understood what Firenze's warning had meant
[26272]74    His attempt is not working
[26273]189    He would do better to abandon it
[26274]6168   Of course, the other creatures who lived in the Forest would have heard Hagrid's fruitless attempts to teach Grawp English
[26275]6660   Yeah-even if yeh jus' talk ter him a bit,' said Hagrid hopefully
[26276]2904    ' Cause I reckon, if he can talk ter people, he'll understand more that we all like im really, an' want im ter stay
[26277]8628   'Harry looked at Hermione, who peered back at him from between the fingers over her face
[26278]2582   Kind of makes you wish we had Norbert back, doesn't it
[26279]5370  ' he said, and she gave a very shaky laugh
[26280]697   Yeh'll do it, then
[26281]18032  ' said Hagrid, who did not seem to have caugit what Harry had just said
[26282]567   We'll 
[26283]0   
[26284]0   
[26285]10872   ' said Harry, already bound by his promise
[26286]1305    We'll try, Hagrid
[26287]12829   ' I knew I could count on yeh, Harry,' Hagrid said, beaming in a very watery way and dabbing at his face with his handkerchief again
[26288]1651    An' I don' wan' yeh ter put yerself out too much, like 
[26289]0   
[26290]0   
[26291]2312    I know yeh've got exams 
[26292]0   
[26293]0   
[26294]745    if yeh could jus' nip down here in yer Invisibility Cloak maybe once a week an' have a little chat with im
[26295]753    I'll wake im up, then-introduce yeh-'Wha-no
[26296]6718  ' said Hermione, jumping up
[26297]8179    Hagrid, no, don't wake him, really, we don't need-'But Hagrid had already stepped over the great tree trunk in front of them and was proceeding towards Grawp
[26298]9137    When he was about ten feet away, he lifted a long, broken bough from the ground, smiled reassuringly over his shoulder at Harry and Hermione, then poked Grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough
[26299]947   The giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent Forest; birds in the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared away
[26300]8052    In front of Harry and Hermione, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp was rising from the ground, which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself on to his knees
[26301]831    He turned his head to see who and what had disturbed him
[26302]32   All righ', Grawpy
[26303]7245  ' said Hagrid, in a would-be cheery voice, backing away with the long bough raised, ready to poke Grawp again
[26304]123    Had a nice sleep, eh
[26305]7593  ' Harry and Hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights
[26306]124    Grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet uprooted
[26307]1345    They looked up into his startlingly huge face that resembled a grey full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing
[26308]399    It was as though the features had been hewn on to a great stone ball
[26309]2352    The nose was stubby and shapeless, the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half-bricks; the eyes, small by giant standards, were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were half-gummed together with sleep
[26310]1128    Grawp raised dirty knuckles, each as big as a cricket ball, to his eyes, rubbed vigorously, then, without warning, pushed himself to his feet with surprising speed and agility
[26311]362   Oh my
[26312]7652  ' Harry heard Hermione squeal, terrified, beside him
[26313]4931   The trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawp's wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously
[26314]6026    He was, as Hagrid had said, at least sixteen feet tall
[26315]8254    Gazing blearily around, Grawp reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella, seized a bird's nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned it upside-down with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it; eggs fell like grenades towards the ground and Hagrid threw his arms over his head to protect himself
[26316]2640   Anyway, Grawpy,' shouted Hagrid, looking up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs, I've brought some friends ter meet yeh
[26317]557    Remember, I told yeh I might
[26318]6728   Remember, when I said I might have ter go on a little trip an' leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit
[26319]112   Remember that, Grawpy
[26320]2416  'But Grawp merely gave another low roar; it was hard to say whether he was listening to Hagrid or whether he even recognised the sounds Hagrid was making as speech
[26321]759    He had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling it towards him, evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go
[26322]640   Now, Grawpy, don' do that
[26323]787  ' shouted Hagrid
[26324]15660    Tha's how you ended up pullin' up the others- 'And sure enough, Harry could see the earth around the tree's roots beginning to crack
[26325]841   I got company for yeh
[26326]787  ' Hagrid shouted
[26327]21    Company, see
[26328]876   Look down, yeh big buffoon, I brought yeh some friends
[26329]11427  'Oh, Hagrid, don't,' moaned Hermione, but Hagrid had already raised the bough again and gave Grawp's knee a sharp poke
[26330]1828   The giant let go of the top of the tree, which swayed alarmingly and deluged Hagrid with a rain of pine needles, and looked down
[26331]17408   This,' said Hagrid, hastening over to where Harry and Herrmone stood, is Harry, Grawp
[26332]6193   Harry Potter
[26333]889   He migh' be comin' ter visit yeh if I have ter go away, understand
[26334]8259  'The giant had only just realised that Harry and Hermione were there
[26335]921    They watched, in great trepidation, as he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them
[26336]1615   An' this is Hermione, see
[26337]678   Her-' Hagrid hesitated
[26338]8939    Turning to Hermione, he said, Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy, Hermione
[26339]5105   On'y it's a difficult name fer him ter remember
[26340]1624   'No, not at all,' squeaked Hermione
[26341]52   This is Hermy, Grawp
[26342]4758   An' she's gonna be comin' an' all
[26343]101   Is'n' tha' nice
[26344]28   Eh
[26345]385   Two friends fer yeh ter-GRAWPY, NO
[26346]18032  'Grawp's hand had shot out of nowhere towards Hermione; Harry seized her and pulled her backwards behind the tree, so that Grawp's fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air
[26347]231   BAD BOY, GRAWPY
[26348]8446  ' they heard Hagrid yelling, as Hermione clung to Harry behind the tree, shaking and whimpering
[26349]224    VERY BAD BOY
[26350]786   YEH DON' GRAB-OUCH
[26351]7833  'Harry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw Hagrid lying on his back, his hand over his nose
[26352]374    Grawp, apparently losing interest, had straightened up and was again engaged in pulling back the pine as far as it would go
[26353]6398   Righ',' said Hagrid thickly, getting up with one hand pinching his bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow, well 
[26354]0   
[26355]0   
[26356]130    there yeh are 
[26357]0   
[26358]0   
[26359]2921    yeh've met him an' -an' now he'll know yeh when yeh come back
[26360]277    Yeah 
[26361]0   
[26362]0   
[26363]0    well 
[26364]0   
[26365]0   
[26366]1925   'He looked up at Grawp, who was now pulling back the pine with an expression of detached pleasure on his boulderish face; the roots were creaking as he ripped them away from the ground
[26367]10769   Well, I reckon tha's enough fer one day,' said Hagrid
[26368]1255    We'll-'er-we'll go back now, shall we
[26369]7405  'Harry and Hermione nodded
[26370]1260    Hagrid shouldered his crossbow again and, still pinching his nose, led the way back into the trees
[26371]720   Nobody spoke for a while, not even when they heard the distant crash that meant Grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last
[26372]7070    Hermione's face was pale and set
[26373]6786    Harry could not think of a single thing to say
[26374]1502    What on earth was going to happen when somebody found out that Hagrid had hidden Grawp in the Forbidden Forest
[26375]9121   And he had promised that he, Ron and Hermione would continue Hagrid's totally pointless attempts to civilise the giant
[26376]775    How could Hagrid, even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were loveably harmless, fool himself that Grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans
[26377]14025  Hold it,' said Hagrid abruptly, just as Harry and Hermione were struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him
[26378]313    He pulled an arrow out of the quiver over his shoulder and fitted it into the crossbow
[26379]8006    Harry and Hermione raised their wands; now that they had stopped walking, they, too, could hear movement close by
[26380]6254   Oh, blimey,' said Hagrid quietly
[26381]7153   I thought we told you, Hagrid,' said a deep male voice, That you are no longer welcome here
[26382]10544  'A man's naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating towards them through the dappled green half-light; then they saw that his waist joined smoothly into a horse's chestnut body
[26383]1446    This centaur had a proud, high-cheekboned face and long black hair
[26384]1441    Like Hagrid, he was armed; a quiverful of arrows and a longbow were slung over his shoulders
[26385]147   How are yeh, Magorian
[26386]5742  ' said Hagrid warily
[26387]191   The trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more centaurs emerged behind him
[26388]6745    Harry recognised the black-bodied and bearded Bane, whom he had met nearly four years ago on the same night he had met Firenze
[26389]6222    Bane gave no sign that he had ever seen Harry before
[26390]5808   So,' he said, with a nasty inflection in his voice, before turning immediately to Magorian
[26391]1269    We agreed, I think, what we would do if this human ever showed his face in the Forest again
[26392]37  '"This human now, am I
[26393]5743  ' said Hagrid testily
[26394]212    Jus' fer stoppin' all of yeh committin' murder
[26395]5818  'You ought not to have meddled, Hagrid,' said Magorian
[26396]20    Our ways are not yours, nor are our laws
[26397]50    Firenze has betrayed and dishonoured us
[26398]6060   'I dunno how yeh work that out,' said Hagrid impatiently
[26399]11779    He's done nothin' except help Albus Dumbledore-'Firenze has entered into servitude to humans,' said a grey centaur with a hard, deeply lined face
[26400]2   Servitude
[26401]5743  ' said Hagrid scathingly
[26402]10913    He's doin' Dumbledore a favour is all-'He is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans,' said Magorian quietly
[26403]57    There can be no return from such disgrace
[26404]18490   'If yeh say so,' said Hagrid, shrugging, but personally I think yeh're makin' a big mistake-'As are you, human,' said Bane, coming back into our Forest when we warned you-'Now, yeh listen ter me,' said Hagrid angrily
[26405]5704    I'll have less of the our Forest, if it's all the same ter yeh
[26406]10827    It's not up ter yeh who comes an' goes in here-'No more is it up to you, Hagrid,' said Magorian smoothly
[26407]470    I shall let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young-'They're not his
[26408]37  ' interrupted Bane contemptuously
[26409]389    Students, Magorian, from up at the school
[26410]4872   They have probably already profited from the traitor Firenze's teachings
[26411]5233   'Nevertheless,' said Magorian calmly, the slaughter of foals is a terrible crime-we do not touch the innocent
[26412]744    Today, Hagrid, you pass
[26413]600    Henceforth, stay away from this place
[26414]145    You forfeited the friendship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor Firenze escape us
[26415]1434   'I won' be kept outta the Fores' by a bunch o' old mules like yeh
[26416]5874  ' said Hagrid loudly
[26417]18401   Hagrid,' said Hermione in a high-pitched and terrified voice, as both Bane and the grey centaur pawed at the ground, let's go, please let's go
[26418]1458  'Hagrid moved forwards, but his crossbow was still raised and his eyes were still fixed threateningly upon Magorian
[26419]1574   We know what you are keeping in the Forest, Hagrid
[26420]315  ' Magorian called after them, as the centaurs slipped out of sight
[26421]2    And our tolerance is waning
[26422]1410  'Hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk straight back to Magorian
[26423]10672   Yeh'll tolerate im as long as he's here, it's as much his Forest as yours
[26424]13063  ' he yelled, as Harry and Hermione both pushed with all their might against Hagrid's moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep him moving forwards
[26425]1222    Still scowling, he looked down; his expression changed to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him; he seemed not to have felt it
[26426]5262   Calm down, you two,' he said, turning to walk on while they parted along behind him
[26427]231    Ruddy old mules, though, eh
[26428]34207  'Hagrid,' said Hermione breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there, if the centaurs don't want humans in the Forest, it doesn't really look as though Harry and I will be able-'Ah, you heard what they said,' said Hagrid dismissively, they wouldn't hurt foals-I mean, kids
[26429]461    Anyway, we can' let ourselves be pushed aroun' by that lot
[26430]8182   'Nice try,' Harry murmured to Hermione, who looked crestfallen
[26431]734   At last they rejoined the path and, after another ten minutes, the trees began to thin; they were able to see patches of clear blue sky again and, in the distance, the definite sounds of cheering and shouting
[26432]19   Was that another goal
[26433]1523  ' asked Hagrid, pausing in the shelter of the trees as the Quidditch stadium came into view
[26434]847    Or d'yeh reckon the match is over
[26435]10438  'I don't know,' said Hermione miserably
[26436]7792    Harry saw that she looked much the worse for wear; her hair was full of twigs and leaves, her robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous scratches on her face and arms
[26437]1207    He knew he must look little better
[26438]5701   I reckon it's over, yeh know
[26439]5773  ' said Hagrid, still squinting towards the stadium
[26440]10576    Look- there's people comin' out already-if yeh two hurry yeh'll be able ter blend in with the crowd an' no one'll know yeh weren't there
[26441]11272  'Good idea,' said Harry
[26442]0    Well 
[26443]0   
[26444]0   
[26445]777    see you later, then, Hagrid
[26446]11206   'I don't believe him,' said Hermione in a very unsteady voice, the moment they were out of earshot of Hagrid
[26447]3042    I don't believe him
[26448]3330    I really don't believe him
[26449]10849   'Calm down,' said Harry
[26450]31   Calm down
[26451]5095  ' she said feverishly
[26452]54    A giant
[26453]164   A giant in the Forest
[26454]160   And we're supposed to give him English lessons
[26455]782   Always assuming, of course, we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in and out
[26456]3042   I-don't-believe- him
[26457]3128  'We haven't got to do anything yet
[26458]6643  ' Harry tried to reassure her in a quiet voice, as they joined a stream of jabbering Hufflepuffs heading back towards the castle
[26459]4892    He's not asking us to do anything unless he gets chucked out and that might not even happen
[26460]6530   'Oh, come off it, Harry
[26461]7237  ' said Hermione angrily, stopping dead in her tracks so that the people behind had to swerve to avoid her
[26462]7779    Of course he's going to be chucked out and, to be perfectly honest, after what we've just seen, who can blame Umbridge
[26463]6474  'There was a pause in which Harry glared at her, and her eyes filled slowly with tears
[26464]13894   You didn't mean that,' said Harry quietly
[26465]0   No 
[26466]0   
[26467]0   
[26468]0    well 
[26469]0   
[26470]0   
[26471]557    all right 
[26472]0   
[26473]0   
[26474]8374    I didn't,' she said, wiping her eyes angrily
[26475]422    But why does he have to make life so difficult for himself-for us
[26476]5128  'I dunno-'Weasley is our King,Weasley is our King,He didn't let the Quaffle in,Weasley is our King 
[26477]0   
[26478]0   
[26479]10080   ' And I wish they'd stop singing that stupid song,' said Hermione miserably, haven't they gloated enough
[26480]579  'A great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the pitch
[26481]12230   Oh, let's get in before we have to meet the Slytherins,' said Hermione
[26482]6199   Weasley can save anything,He never leaves a single ring,That's why Gryffindors all sing:Weasley is our King
[26483]1615    'Hermione 
[26484]0   
[26485]0   
[26486]10944   ' said Harry slowly
[26487]994   The song was growing louder, but it was issuing not from a crowd of green-and-silver-clad Slytherins, but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly towards the castle, bearing a solitary figure upon its many shoulders
[26488]5084   Weasley is our King,Weasley is our King,He didn't let the Quaffle in,Weasley is our King 
[26489]0   
[26490]0   
[26491]0   'No
[26492]7254  ' said Hermione in a hushed voice
[26493]292   YES
[26494]10954  ' said Harry loudly
[26495]5732   HARRY
[26496]1615   HERMIONE
[26497]3333  ' yelled Ron, waving the silver Quidditch cup in the air and looking quite beside himself
[26498]667    WE DID IT
[26499]136   WE WON
[26500]134  'They beamed up at him as he passed
[26501]8916    There was a scrum at the door of the castle and Ron's head got rather badly bumped on the lintel, but nobody seemed to want to put him down
[26502]506    Still singing, the crowd squeezed itself into the Entrance Hall and out of sight
[26503]8577    Harry and Hermione watched them go, beaming, until the last echoing strains of Weasley is our King' died away
[26504]342    Then they turned to each other, their smiles fading
[26505]723   We'll save our news till tomorrow, shall we
[26506]10818  ' said Harry
[26507]7562   Yes, all right,' said Hermione wearily
[26508]477    I'm not in any hurry
[26509]100   'They climbed the steps together
[26510]914    At the front doors both instinctively looked back at the Forbidden Forest
[26511]8140    Harry was not sure whether or not it was his imagination, but he rather thought he saw a small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the tree tops in the distance, almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the roots

[26529]9756     Ron's euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrape the Quidditch cup was such that he couldn't settle to anything next day
[26530]7833    All he wanted to do was talk over the match, so Harry and Hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp
[26531]2558    Not that either of them tried very hard; neither was keen to be the one to bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion
[26532]1061    As it was another fine, warm day, they persuaded him to join them in revising under the beech tree at the edge of the lake, where they had less chance of being overheard than in the common room
[26533]4101    Ron was not particularly keen on this idea at first-he was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by every Gryffindor who walked past his chair, not to mention the occasional outbursts of Weasley is our King'-but after a while he agreed that some fresh air might do him good
[26534]3988   They spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while Ron talked them through his first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time
[26535]10026   Well, I mean, I'd already let in that one of Davies's, so I wasn't feeling all that confident, but I dunno, when Bradley came towards me, just out of nowhere, I thought-you can do this
[26536]8198   And I had about a second to decide which way to fly, you know, because he looked like he was aiming for the right goalhoop- my right, obviously, his left-but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting, and so I took the chance and flew left-his right, I mean-and-well-you saw what happened,' he concluded modestly, sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest to them-a bunch of gossiping third-year Hufflepuffs-had heard him
[26537]460    And then, when Chambers came at me about five minutes later-What
[26538]14064  ' Ron asked, having stopped mid-sentence at the look on Harry's face
[26539]43    Why are you grinning
[26540]12187  'I'm not,' said Harry quickly, and looked down at his Transfiguration notes, attempting to straighten his lace
[26541]9310    The truth was that Ron had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree
[26542]6162    I'm just glad we won, that's all
[26543]7740   'Yeah,' said Ron slowly, savouring the words, we won
[26544]8157   Did you see the look on Chang's face when Ginny got the Snitch right out from under her nose
[26545]770  ' I suppose she cried, did she
[26546]10835  ' said Harry bitterly
[26547]310   Well, yeah- more out of temper than anything, though 
[26548]0   
[26549]0   
[26550]2173   ' Ron frowned slightly
[26551]4246    But you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground, didn't you
[26552]10939  'Er-' said Harry
[26553]51   Well, actually 
[26554]0   
[26555]0   
[26556]9484    no, Ron,' said Hermione with a heavy sigh, putting down her book and looking at him apologetically
[26557]11249    As a matter of fact, the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Davies's first goal
[26558]6989   'Ron's carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment
[26559]2789    You didn't watch
[26560]5708  ' he said faintly, looking from one to the other
[26561]2914    You didn't see me make any of those saves
[26562]7076  'Well-no,' said Hermione, stretching out a placatory hand towards him
[26563]5167    But Ron, we didn't want to leave-we had to
[26564]277  'Yeah
[26565]7739  ' said Ron, whose face was growing rather red
[26566]436    How come
[26567]11470  'It was Hagrid,' said Harry
[26568]5914    He decided to tell us why he's been covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants
[26569]1098    He wanted us to go into the Forest with him, we had no choice, you know how he gets
[26570]0    Anyway 
[26571]0   
[26572]0   
[26573]7957   'The story was told in five minutes, by the end of which Ron's indignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity
[26574]157   He brought one back and hid it in the Forest
[26575]10854  'Yep,' said Harry grimly
[26576]7397   No,' said Ron, as though by saying this he could make it untrue
[26577]2308    No, he can't have
[26578]6746   'Well, he has,' said Hermione firmly
[26579]5322    Grawp's about sixteen feet tall, enjoys ripping up twenty-foot pine trees, and knows me,' she snorted, as Hermy
[26580]2314   'Ron gave a nervous laugh
[26581]690   And Hagrid wants us to 
[26582]0   
[26583]0   
[26584]0    
[26585]11139  'Teach him English, yeah,' said Harry
[26586]12593   He's lost his mind,' said Ron in an almost awed voice
[26587]7563   Yes,' said Hermione irritably, turning a page of Intermediate Transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses
[26588]1335    Yes, I'm starting to think he has
[26589]5771    But, unfortunately, he made Harry and me promise
[26590]13238   'Well, you're just going to have to break your promise, that's all,' said Ron firmly
[26591]667    I mean, come on 
[26592]0   
[26593]0   
[26594]1989    we've got exams and we're about that far-' he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger almost touching -from being chucked out as it is
[26595]0    And anyway 
[26596]0   
[26597]0   
[26598]107    remember Norbert
[26599]144   Remember Aragog
[26600]6052   Have we ever come off better for mixing with any of Hagrid's monster mates
[26601]13729  'I know, it's just that-we promised,' said Hermione in a small voice
[26602]2805   Ron smoothed his hair flat again, looking preoccupied
[26603]3060   Well,' he sighed, Hagrid hasn't been sacked yet, has he
[26604]8610   He's hung on this long, maybe he'll hang on till the end of term and we won't have to go near Grawp at all
[26605]496   'The castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly painted; the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling lake; the satin green lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze
[26606]570    June had arrived, but to the fifth-years this meant only one thing: their OWLs were upon them at last
[26607]1212   Their teachers were no longer setting them homework; lessons were devoted to revising those topics the teachers thought most likely to come up in the exams
[26608]18458    The purposeful, feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the OWLs from Harry's mind, though he did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had ever told Snape that he must continue giving Harry Ooclumency tuition
[26609]6448    If he had, then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring Harry
[26610]9180    This suited Harry very well; he was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with Snape, and to his relief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about Occlumency; she was spending a lot of time muttering to herself, and had not laid out any elf clothes for days
[26611]263   She was not the only person acting oddly as the OWLs drew steadily nearer
[26612]429    Ernie Macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their revision practices
[26613]1575   How many hours d'you think you're doing a day
[26614]8402  ' he demanded of Harry and Ron as they queued outside Herbology, a manic gleam in his eyes
[26615]7132   I dunno,' said Ron
[26616]0    A few
[26617]0   'More or less than eight
[26618]12636  'Less, I s'pose,' said Ron, looking slightly alarmed
[26619]5838   I'm doing eight,' said Ernie, puffing out his chest
[26620]0    Eight or nine
[26621]838    I'm getting an hour in before breakfast every day
[26622]4    Eights my average
[26623]522    I can do ten on a good weekend day
[26624]856    I did nine and a half on Monday
[26625]403    Not so good on Tuesday-only seven and a quarter
[26626]6749    Then on Wednesday-'Harry was deeply thankful that Professor Sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point, forcing Ernie to abandon his recital
[26627]921   Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy had found a different way to induce panic
[26628]12519   Of course, it's not what you know,' he was heard to tell Crabbe and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few days before the exams were to start, it's who you know
[26629]6668    Now, Father's been friendly with the head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years-old Griselda Marchbanks-we've had her round for dinner and everthing 
[26630]0   
[26631]0   
[26632]5364   'Do you think that's true
[26633]9484  ' Hermione whispered in alarm to Harry and Ron
[26634]7099   Nothing we can do about it if it is,' said Ron gloomily
[26635]13834   I don't think it's true,' said Neville quietly from behind them
[26636]14795    Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran's, and she's never mentioned the Malfoy's
[26637]5790   'What's she like, Neville
[26638]1971  ' asked Hermione at once
[26639]5    Is she strict
[26640]7161  'Bit like Gran, really,' said Neville in a subdued voice
[26641]2540   Knowing her won't hurt your chances, though, will it
[26642]2331  ' Ron told him encouragingly
[26643]9499   Oh, I don't think it will make any difference,' said Neville, still more miserably
[26644]6514    Gran's always telling Professor Marchbanks I'm not as good as my dad 
[26645]0   
[26646]0   
[26647]0    well 
[26648]0   
[26649]0   
[26650]5850    you saw what she's like at St
[26651]4785    Mungo's 
[26652]0   
[26653]0   
[26654]1259   'Neville looked fixedly at the floor
[26655]13157    Harry, Ron and Hermione glanced at each other, but didn't know what to say
[26656]1024    It was the first time Neville had acknowledged that they had met at the wizarding hospital
[26657]493   Meanwhile, a flourishing black-market trade in aids to concentration, mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth- and seventh-years
[26658]13025    Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle of Baruffio's Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth-year Eddie Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine Outstanding' OWLs he had gained the previous summer and was offering a whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons
[26659]11277    Ron assured Harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left Hogwarts and got a job, but before they could close the deal, Hermione had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet
[26660]1806   Hermione, we wanted to buy that
[26661]2137  ' shouted Ron
[26662]3049   Don't be stupid,' she snarled
[26663]4791    You might as well take Harold Dingle's powdered dragon claw and have done with it
[26664]5479   'Dingle's got powdered dragon claw
[26665]7139  ' said Ron eagerly
[26666]6701   Not any more,' said Hermione
[26667]5    I confiscated that, too
[26668]1059    None of these things actually work, you know
[26669]223   'Dragon claw does work
[26670]7088  ' said Ron
[26671]16790    It's supposed to be incredible, really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few hours-Hermione, let me have a pinch, go on, it can't hurt-'This stuff can,' said Hermione grimly
[26672]5971    I've had a look at it, and it's actually dried doxy droppings
[26673]12838   'This information took the edge off Harry and Ron's desire for brain stimulants
[26674]230   They received their examination timetables and details of the procedure for OWLs during their next Transfiguration lesson
[26675]1712   As you can see,' Professor McGonagall told the class as they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard, your OWLs are spread over two successive weeks
[26676]120    You will sit the theory papers in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons
[26677]638    Your practical Astronomy examination will, of course, take place at night
[26678]115   Now, I must warn you that the most stringent anti-cheating charms have been applied to your examination papers
[26679]394    Auto-Answer Quills are banned from the examination hall, as are Remembralls, Detachable Cribbing Cuffs and Self-Correcting Ink
[26680]5394    Every year, I am afraid to say, seems to harbour at least one student who thinks that he or she can get around the Wizarding Examinations Authority's rules
[26681]256    I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor
[26682]16711    Our new-Headmistress-' Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her face that Aunt Petunia had whenever she was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt -has asked the Heads of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severely-because, of course, your examination results will reflect upon the Headmistress's new regime at the school-'Professor McGonagall gave a tiny sigh; Harry saw the nostrils of her sharp nose flare
[26683]134   -however, that is no reason not to do your very best
[26684]565    You have your own futures to think about
[26685]7979   'Please, Professor,' said Hermione, her hand in the air, when will we find out our results
[26686]6084  'An owl will be sent to you some time in July,' said Professcr McGonagall
[26687]8290   Excellent,' said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, so we don't have to worry about it till the holidays
[26688]6776   'Harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks' time, waiting for his OWL results
[26689]917    Well, he thought dully, at least he would be sure of one bit of post that summer
[26690]200   Their first examination, Theory of Charms, was scheduled for Monday morning
[26691]9487    Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday, but regretted it almost at once; she was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had got the answer completely right, finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of Achievements in Charming
[26692]3749   Why don't you just do it yourself
[26693]5712  ' he said firmly, handing the book back to her, his eyes watering
[26694]3859   Meanwhile, Ron was reading two years' worth of Charms notes with his fingers in his ears, his lips moving soundlessly; Seamus Finnigan was lying flat on his back on the floor, reciting the definition of a Substantive Charm while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5; and Parvati and Lavender, who were practising basic Locomotion Charms, were making their pencil-cases race each other around the edge of the table
[26695]260   Dinner was a subdued affair that night
[26696]8967    Harry and Ron did not talk much, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day
[26697]2668    Hermione, on the other hand, kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag, from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure
[26698]3539    Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night, when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate
[26699]5922   Oh, my goodness,' she said faintly, staring into the Entrance Hall
[26700]0    Is that them
[26701]3   Is that the examiners
[26702]7774  'Harry and Ron whipped around on their bench
[26703]2242    Through the doors to the Great Hall they could see Umbridge standing with a small group of ancient-looking witches and wizards
[26704]7069    Umbridge, Harry was pleased to see, looked rather nervous
[26705]498   Shall we go and have a closer look
[26706]7088  ' said Ron
[26707]8103   Harry and Hermione nodded and they hastened towards the double doors into the Entrance Hall, slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners
[26708]8887    Harry thought Professor Marchbanks must be the tiny, stooped witch with a face so lined it looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs; Umbridge was speaking to her deferentially
[26709]2650    Professor Marchbanks seemed to be a little deaf; she was answering Professor Umbridge very loudly considering they were only a foot apart
[26710]982   Journey was fine, journey was fine, we've made it plenty of times before
[26711]5131  ' she said impatiently
[26712]3536    Now, I haven't heard from Dumbledore lately
[26713]525  ' she added, peering around the Hall as though hopeful he might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard
[26714]174    No idea where he is, I suppose
[26715]17647  'None at all,' said Umbridge, shooting a malevolent look at Harry, Ron and Hermione, who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as Ron pretended to do up his shoelace
[26716]523    But I daresay the Ministry of Magic will track him down soon enough
[26717]4569   'I doubt it,' shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks, not it Dumbledore doesn't want to be found
[26718]771   I should know 
[26719]0   
[26720]0   
[26721]765    examined him personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did NEWTs

[26725]292   ' Yes

[26727]0   
[26728]0    well 
[26729]0   
[26730]0   
[26731]17041   ' said Professor Umbridge as Harry, Ron and Hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they dared, let me show you to the staff room
[26732]1461    I daresay you'd like a cup of tea after your journey
[26733]163   'It was an uncomfortable sort of an evening
[26734]530    Everyone was trying to do some last-minute revising but nobody seemed to be getting very far
[26735]7315    Harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours
[26736]6104    He remembered his careers consultation and McGonagall's furious declaration that she would help him become an Auror if it was the last thing she did
[26737]616    He wished he had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here
[26738]735    He knew he was not the only one lying awake, but none of the others in the dormitory spoke and finally, one by one, they fell asleep
[26739]3377   None of the fifth-years talked very much at breakfast next day, either: Parvati was practising incantations under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her twitched; Hermione was rereading Achievements in Charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred; and Neville kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade
[26740]11942   Once breakfast was over, the fifth- and seventh-years milled around in the Entrance Hall while the other students went off to lessons; then, at half past nine, they were called forwards class by class to re-enter the Great Hall, which had been rearranged exactly as Harry had seen it in the Pensieve when his father, Sirius and Snape had been taking their OWLs; the four house tables had been removed and replaced instead with many tables for one, all facing the staff-table end of the Hall where Professor McGonagall stood facing them
[26741]6046    When they were all seated and quiet, she said, You may begin,' and turned over an enormous hour-glass on the desk beside her, on which there were also spare quills, ink bottles and rolls of parchment
[26742]9953   Harry turned over his paper, his heart thumping hard-three rows to his right and four seats ahead Hermione was already scribbling-and lowered his eyes to the first question: a) Give the incantation and b) describe the wand movement required to make objects fly
[26743]6269   Harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll 
[26744]0   
[26745]0   
[26746]471    smiling slightly, he bent over the paper and began to write
[26747]2541   Well, it wasn't too bad, was it
[26748]2561  ' asked Hermione anxiously in the Entrance Hall two hours later, still clutching the exam paper
[26749]2812    I'm not sure I did myself justice on Cheering Charms, I just ran out of time
[26750]741    Did you put in the counter-charm for hiccoughs
[26751]13211   I wasn't sure whether I ought to, it felt like too much-and on question twenty-three-'Hermione,' said Ron sternly, we've been through this before 
[26752]0   
[26753]0   
[26754]5538    we're not going through every exam afterwards, it's bad enough doing them once
[26755]1876   'The fifth-years ate lunch with the rest of the school (the four house tables had reappeared for the lunch hour), then they trooped off into the small chamber beside the Great Hall, where they were to wait until called for their practical examination
[26756]1659    As small groups of students were called forwards in alphabetical order, those left behind muttered incantations and practised wand movements, occasionally poking each other in the back or eye by mistake
[26757]6484   Hermione's name was called
[26758]511    Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle and Daphne Greengrass
[26759]10334    Students who had already been tested did not return afterwards, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done
[26760]1484   She'll be fine, remember she got a hundred and twelve per cent on one of our Charms tests
[26761]7088  ' said Ron
[26762]7457   Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, Parkinson, Pansy-Patil, Padma-Patil, Parvati-Potter, Harry
[26763]7591   'Good luck,' said Ron quietly
[26764]7259    Harry walked into the Great Hall, clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook
[26765]3732   Professor Tofty is free, Potter,' squeaked Professor Flitwick, who was standing just inside the door
[26766]9361    He pointed Harry towards what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner, a short distance from Professor Marchbanks, who was halfway through testing Draco Malfoy
[26767]461   Potter, is it
[26768]11679  ' said Professor Tofty, consulting his notes and peering over his pince-nez at Harry as he approached
[26769]486    The famous Potter
[26770]8230  'Out of the corner of his eye, Harry distinctly saw Malfoy throw a scathing look over at him; the wine-glass Malfoy had been levitating fell to the floor and smashed
[26771]6561    Harry could not suppress a grin; Professor Tofty smiled back at him encouragingly
[26772]10780   That's it,' he said in his quavery old voice, no need to be nervous
[26773]367    Now, if I could ask you to take this egg cup and make it do some cartwheels for me
[26774]6318   ' On the whole, Harry thought it went rather well
[26775]11593    His Levitation Charm was certainly much better than Malfoy's had been, though he wished he had not mixed up the incantations for Colour Change and Growth Charms, so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before Harry could rectify his mistake
[26776]2438    He was glad Hermione had not been in the Hall at the time and neglected to mention it to her afterwards
[26777]4929    He could tell Ron, though; Ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened
[26778]8528   There was no time to relax that night; they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged themselves in revision for Transfiguration next day; Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with complex spell models and theories
[26779]818   He forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during his written paper next morning but thought his practical could have been a lot worse
[26780]1348    At least he managed to Vanish the whole of his iguana, whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos, causing the examination to be halted for ten minute; while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall
[26781]6687   They had their Herbology exam on Wednesday (other than a small bite from a Fanged Geranium, Harry felt he had done reasonably well); and then, on Thursday, Defence Against the Dark Arts
[26782]6910    Here, for the first time, Harry felt sure he had passed
[26783]2219    He had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing all the counter-jinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from near the doors into the Entrance Hall
[26784]363   Oh, bravo
[26785]12369  ' cried Professor Tolty, who was examining Harry again, when Harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell
[26786]343    Very good indeed
[26787]5773   Well, I think that's all, Potter 
[26788]0   
[26789]0   
[26790]37    unless 
[26791]0   
[26792]0   
[26793]387   'He leaned forwards a little
[26794]457   I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can produce a Patronus
[26795]87   For a bonus point 
[26796]0   
[26797]0   
[26798]0    
[26799]7562  'Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge and imagined her being sacked
[26800]8   Expecto patronum
[26801]959  'His silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the Hall
[26802]1863    All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically
[26803]35   Excellent
[26804]5086  ' he said
[26805]461    Very well, Potter, you may go
[26806]7460  'As Harry passed Umbridge beside the door, their eyes met
[26807]1173    There was a nasty smile playing around her wide, slack mouth, but he did not care
[26808]1174    Unless he was very much mistaken (and he was not planning on telling anybody, in case he was), he had just achieved an Outstanding' OWL
[26809]9795   On Friday, Harry and Ron had a day off while Hermione sat her Ancient Runes exam, and as they had the whole weekend in front of them they permitted themselves a break from revision
[26810]862    They stretched and yawned beside the open window, through which warm summer air was wafting as they played wizard chess
[26811]6735    Harry could see Hagrid in the distance, teaching a class on the edge of the Forest
[26812]3767    He was trying to guess what creatures they were examining-he thought it must be unicorns, because the boys seemed to be standing back a little-when the portrait hole opened and Hermione clambered in, looking thoroughly bad-tempered
[26813]11   How were the Runes
[26814]7118  ' said Ron, yawning and stretching
[26815]6756   I mis-translated ehwaz,' said Hermione furiously
[26816]122    It means partnership, not defence,I mixed it up with eihwaz
[26817]15364   'Ah well,' said Ron lazily, that's only one mistake, isn't it, you'll still get-'Oh, shut up
[26818]6784  ' said Hermione angrily
[26819]102    It could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail
[26820]14995    And what's more, someone's put another Niffler in Umbridge's office
[26821]20659    I don't know how they got it through that new door, but I just walked past there and Umbridge is shrieking her head off-by the sound of it, it tried to take a chunk out of her leg-'Good,' said Harry and Ron together
[26822]343   It is not good
[26823]6709  ' said Hermione hotly
[26824]5740    She thinks it's Hagrid doing it, remember
[26825]993   And we do not want Hagrid chucked out
[26826]18356  'He's teaching at the moment; she can't blame him,' said Harry, gesturing out of the window
[26827]6096   Oh, you're so naive sometimes, Harry
[26828]1511    You really think Umbridge will wait for proof
[26829]7391  ' said Hermione, who seemed determined to be in a towering temper, and she swept off towards the girls' dormitories, banging the door behind her
[26830]17888   Such a lovely, sweet-tempered girl,' said Ron, very quietly, prodding his queen forward to beat up one of Harry's knights
[26831]21296   Hermione's bad mood persisted for most of the weekend, though Harry and Ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of Saturday and Sunday revising for Potions on Monday, the exam which Harry had been looking forward to least-and which he was sure would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an Auror
[26832]2110    Sure enough, he found the written paper difficult, though he thought he might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice Potion; he could describe its effects accurately, having taken it illegally in his second year
[26833]112   The afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected, it to be
[26834]696    With Snape absent from the proceedings, he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions
[26835]13012    Neville, who was sitting very near Harry, also looked happier than Harry had ever seen him during a Potions class
[26836]12589    When Professor Marchbanks said, Step away from your cauldrons, please, the examination is over,' Harry corked his sample flask feeling that he might not have achieved a good grade but he had, with luck, avoided a fail
[26837]6231   Only four exams left,' said Parvati Patil wearily as they headed back to Gryffindor common room
[26838]0   Only
[26839]6703  ' said Hermione snappishly
[26840]6255    I've got Arithmancy and it's probably the toughest subject there is
[26841]1024  'Nobody was foolish enough to snap back, so she was unable to vent her spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some first-years for giggling too loudly in the common room
[26842]11759   Harry was determined to perform well in Tuesday's Care of Magical Creatures exam so as not to let Hagrid down
[26843]2054    The practical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, where students were required to correctly identify the Knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs (the trick was to offer them all milk in turn: Knarls, highly suspicious creatures whose quills had many magical properties, generally went berserk at what they saw as an attempt to poison them); then demonstrate correct handling of a Bowtruckle; feed and clean out a Fire Crab without sustaining serious burns; and choose, from a wide selection of food, the diet they would give a sick unicorn
[26844]6762   Harry could see Hagrid watching anxiously out of his cabin window
[26845]18674    When Harry's examiner, a plump little witch this time, smiled at him and told him he could leave, Harry gave Hagrid a fleeting thumbs-up before heading back to the castle
[26846]386   The Astronomy theory paper on Wednesday morning went well enough
[26847]11803    Harry was not convinced he had got the names of all Jupiter's moons right, but was at least confident that none of them was inhabited by mice
[26848]329    They had to wait until evening for their practical Astronomy; the afternoon was devoted instead to Divination
[26849]10860   Even by Harry's low standards in Divination, the exam went very badly
[26850]3891    He might as well have tried to see moving pictures on the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball; he lost his head completely during tea-leaf reading, saying it looked to him as though Professor Marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round, dark, soggy stranger, and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous Tuesday
[26851]7682   Well, we were always going to fail that one,' said Ron gloomily as they ascended the marble staircase
[26852]12826    He had just made Harry feel rather better by telling him how he had told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball, only to look up and realise he had been describing his examiner's reflection
[26853]13527   We shouldn't have taken the stupid subject in the first place,' said Harry
[26854]0   Still, at least we can give it up now
[26855]11095   'Yeah,' said Harry
[26856]127    No more pretending we care what happens when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly
[26857]6483   'And from now on, I don't care if my tea-leaves spell die, Ron, die-I'm just chucking them in the bin where they belong
[26858]8491   'Harry laughed just as Hermione came running up behind them
[26859]250    He stopped laughing at once, in case it annoyed her
[26860]14702   Well, I think I've done all right in Arithmancy,' she said, and Harry and Ron both sighed with relief
[26861]1938    Just time for a quick look over our star-charts before dinner, then 
[26862]0   
[26863]0   
[26864]555   'When they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at eleven o'clock, they found a perfect night for stargazing, cloudless and still
[26865]277    The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight and there was a slight chill in the air
[26866]1360    Each of them set up his or her telescope and, when Professor Marchbanks gave the word, proceeded to fill in the blank star-chart they had been given
[26867]302   Professors Marchbanks and Tofty strolled among them, watching as they entered the precise positions of the stars and planets they were observing
[26868]288    All was quiet except for the rustle of parchment, the occasional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand, and the scribbling of many quills
[26869]1396    Half an hour passed, then ar hour; the little squares of reflected gold light flickering on the: ground below started to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished
[26870]7304   As Harry completed the constellation Orion on his chart, however, the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where he was standing, so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way across the lawn
[26871]6721    Harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more
[26872]5915   Harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it, now examining Venus
[26873]1624    He looked down at his chart to enter the planet there, but something distracted him; pausing with his quill suspended over the parchment, he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn
[26874]759    If they had not been moving, and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads, they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they walked
[26875]6130    Even at this distance, Harry had a funny feeling he recognised the walk of the squattest of them, who seemed to be leading the group
[26876]1423   He could not think why Umbridge would be taking a stroll outside after midnight, much less accompanied by five others
[26877]176    Then somebody coughed behind him, and he remembered that he was halfway through an exam
[26878]5009    He had quite forgotten Venus's position
[26879]1204    Jamming his eye to his telescope, he found it again and was once more about to enter it on his chart when, alert for any odd sound, he heard a distant knock which echoed through the deserted grounds, followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog
[26880]783   He looked up, his heart hammering
[26881]5840    There were lights on in Hagrid's windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them
[26882]1147    The door opened and he distinctly saw six sharply defined figures walk over the threshold
[26883]682    The door closed again and there was silence
[26884]6022   Harry felt very uneasy
[26885]22139    He glanced around to see whether Ron or Hermione had noticed what he had, but Professor Marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment and, not wanting to look as though he was sneaking looks at anyone else's work, Harry hastily bent over his star-chart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet towards Hagrid's cabin
[26886]366    Figures were now moving across the cabin windows, temporarily blocking the light
[26887]8659   He could feel Professor Marchbanks's eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope, staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago, but as Professor Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower
[26888]11644    Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrid's cabin
[26889]1313   Professor Tofty gave another dry little cough
[26890]5292   Try and concentrate, now, boys and girls,' he said softly
[26891]377   Most people returned to their telescopes
[26892]6683    Harry looked to his left
[26893]7119    Hermione was gazing transfixed at Hagrid's cabin
[26894]5962   Ahem-twenty minutes to go,' said Professor Tofty
[26895]8234   Hermione jumped and returned at once to her star-chart; Harry looked down at his own and noticed that he had mis-labelled Venus as Mars
[26896]57    He bent to correct it
[26897]168   There was a loud BANG from the grounds
[26898]364    Several people cried Ouch
[26899]1047  ' when they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes as they hastened to see what was going on below
[26900]7801   Hagrid's door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him quite clearly, a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fists, surrounded by six people, all of whom, judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction, seemed to be attempting to Stun him
[26901]0   No
[26902]1655  ' cried Hermione
[26903]90   My dear
[26904]6391  ' said Professor Tofty in a scandalised voice
[26905]24    This is an examination
[26906]74  'But nobody was paying the slightest attention to their star-charts any more
[26907]11662    Jets of red light were still flying about beside Hagrid's cabin, yet somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him; he was still upright and still, as far as Harry could see, fighting
[26908]958    Cries and yells echoed across the grounds; a man yelled, Be reasonable, Hagrid
[26909]1719  'Hagrid roared, Reasonable be damned, yeh won' take me like this, Dawlish
[26910]7139  ' Harry could see the tiny outline of Fang, attempting to defend Hagrid, leaping repeatedly at the wizards surrounding him until a Stunning Spell caught him and he fell to the ground
[26911]3630    Hagrid gave a howl of fury, lifted the culprit bodily from the ground and threw him; the man flew what looked like ten feet and did not get up again
[26912]11510    Hermione gasped, both hands over her mouth; Harry looked round at Ron and saw that he, too, was looking scared
[26913]926    None of them had ever seen Hagrid in a real temper before
[26914]457   Look
[26915]1800  ' squealed Parvati, who was leaning over the parapet and pointing to the foot of the castle where the front doors had opened again; more light was spilling out on to the dark lawn and a single long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn
[26916]288   Now, really
[26917]5884  ' said Professor Tofty anxiously
[26918]1175    Only sixteen minutes left, you know
[26919]5744  'But nobody paid him the slightest attention: they were watching the person now sprinting towards the battle beside Hagrid's cabin
[26920]23   How dare you
[26921]224  ' the figure shouted as she ran
[26922]23    How dare you
[26923]5005  'It's McGonagall
[26924]1738  ' whispered Hermione
[26925]122   Leave him alone
[26926]270   Alone,I say
[26927]11429  ' said Professor McGonagall's voice through the darkness
[26928]71    On what grounds are you attacking him
[26929]1729   He has done nothing, nothing to warrant such-'Hermione, Parvati and Lavender all screamed
[26930]1118    The figures around the cabin had shot no fewer than four Stunners at Professor McGonagall
[26931]2468    Halfway between cabin and castle the red beams collided with her; for a moment she looked luminous and glowed an eerie red, then she lifted right off her feet, landed hard on her back, and moved no more
[26932]10   Galloping gargoyles
[26933]1024  ' shouted Professor Tofty, who also seemed to have forgotten the exam completely
[26934]29    Not so much as a warning
[26935]14   Outrageous behaviour
[26936]2  'COWARDS
[26937]1696  ' bellowed Hagrid; his voice carried clearly to the top of the tower, and several lights flickered back on inside the castle
[26938]14    RUDDY COWARDS
[26939]2128   HAVE SOME O' THAT- AN' THAT-'Oh my-' gasped Hermione
[26940]1063   Hagrid took two massive swipes at his closest attackers; judging by their immediate collapse, they had been knocked cold
[26941]7258    Harry saw Hagrid double over, and thought he had finally been overcome by a spell
[26942]7098    But, on the contrary, next moment Hagrid was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his back-then Harry realised that bangs limp body was draped around his shoulders
[26943]0   Get him, get him
[26944]6712  ' screamed Umbridge, but her remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of Hagrid's fists; indeed, he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over
[26945]1230    Hagrid had turned and begun to run with Fang still hung around his neck
[26946]1602    Umbridge sent one last Stunning Spell after him but it missed; and Hagrid, running full-pelt towards the distant gates, disappeared into the darkness
[26947]5620   There was a long minute's quivering silence as everybody gazed open-mouthed into the grounds
[26948]11157    Then Professor Tofty's voice said feebly, Um 
[26949]0   
[26950]0   
[26951]156    five minutes to go, everybody
[26952]6041   'Though he had only filled in two-thirds of his chart, Harry was desperate for the exam to end
[26953]3969    When it came at last he, Ron and Hermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders and dashed back down the spiral staircase
[26954]1272    None of the students were going to bed; they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stairs about what they had witnessed
[26955]77   That evil woman
[26956]1949  ' gasped Hermione, who seemed to be having difficulty talking due to rage
[26957]1180    Trying to sneak up on Hagrid in the dead of night
[26958]11075  'She clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawney's,' said Ernie Macmillan sagely, squeezing over to join them
[26959]4027   Hagrid did well, didn't he
[26960]7796  ' said Ron, who looked more alarmed than impressed
[26961]496    How come all the spells bounced off him
[26962]7428  'It'll be his giant blood,' said Hermione shakily

[26971]618    Well, I'm off to bed
[26972]190    Night, all
[26973]1829   'People around them were drifting away, still talking excitedly about what they had just seen
[26974]10500   At least they didn't get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban,' said Ron
[26975]8101    I spect he's gone to join Dumbledore, hasn't he
[26976]7443  'I suppose so,' said Hermione, who looked tearful
[26977]3630    Oh, this is awful, I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long, but now we've lost Hagrid too
[26978]742   'They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full
[26979]450    The commotion out in the grounds had woken several people, who had hastened to rouse their friends
[26980]10216    Seamus and Dean, who had arrived ahead of Harry, Ron and Hermione, were now telling everyone what they had seen and heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower
[26981]665   But why sack Hagrid now
[26982]1045  ' asked Angelina Johnson, shaking her head
[26983]10799    It's not like Trelawney; he's been teaching much better than usual this year
[26984]6764  'Urnbridge hates part-humans,' said Hermione bitterly, flopping down into an armchair
[26985]1227    She was always going to try and get Hagrid out
[26986]1349   'And she thought Hagrid was putting Nifflers in her office,' piped up Katie Bell
[26987]5716   Oh, blimey,' said Lee Jordan, covering his mouth
[26988]9711    It's me who's been putting the Nifflers in her office
[26989]1993    Fred and George left me a couple; I've been levitating them in through her window
[26990]5788   'She'd have sacked him anyway,' said Dean
[26991]915    He was too close to Dumbledore
[26992]22026   ' That's true,' said Harry, sinking into an armchair beside Hermione's
[26993]12301   I just hope Professor McGonagall's all right,' said Lavender tearfully
[26994]5591   They carried her back up to the castle, we watched through the dormitory window,' said Colin Creevey
[26995]3165    She didn't look very well
[26996]5384   'Madam Pomfrey will sort her out,' said Alicia Spinnet firmly
[26997]4761    She's never failed yet
[26998]792   'It was nearly four in the morning before the common room cleared
[26999]15673    Harry felt wide awake; the image of Hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting him; he was so angry with Umbridge he could not think of a punishment bad enough for her, though Ron's suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts had its merits
[27000]714    He fell asleep contemplating hideous revenges and arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested
[27001]503   Their final exam, History of Magic, was not to take place until that afternoon
[27002]10479    Harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast, but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of last-minute revision, so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the common-room window, trying hard not to doze off as he read through some of the three-and-a-half-feet-high stack of notes that Hermione had lent him
[27003]1681   The fifth-years entered the Great Hall at two o'clock and took their places in front of their face-down examination papers
[27004]6027    Harry felt exhausted
[27005]11108    He just wanted this to be over, so that he could go and sleep; then tomorrow, he and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch pitch-he was going to have a fly on Ron's broom-and savour their freedom from revision
[27006]6372   Turn over your papers,' said Professor Marchbanks from the front of the Hall, flicking over the giant hour-glass
[27007]5923    You may begin 'Harry stared fixedly at the first question
[27008]436    It was several seconds before it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it; there was a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high windows
[27009]356    Slowly, tortuously, he at last began to write an answer
[27010]320   He was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates
[27011]1454    He simply skipped question four (In your opinion, did wand legislation contribute to, or lead to better control of, goblin riots of the eighteenth century
[27012]863  ), thinking that he would go back to it if he had time at the end
[27013]91    He had a stab at question five (How was the Statute of Secrecy breached in 1749 and what measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence
[27014]813  ) but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several important points; he had a feeling vampires had come into the story somewhere
[27015]1734   He looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his eyes alighted upon number ten: Describe the circumstances that led to the formation of the International Confederation of Wizards and explain why the warlocks of Liechtenstein refused to join
[27016]7227   I know this, Harry thought, though his brain felt torpid and slack
[27017]6549    He could visualise a heading, in Hermione's handwriting: The formation of the International Confederation of Wizards 
[27018]0   
[27019]0   
[27020]261    he had read those notes only this morning
[27021]2089   He began to write, looking up now and again to check the large hour-glass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks
[27022]1827    He was sitting right behind Parvati Patil, whose long dark hair fell below the back of her chair
[27023]1940    Once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden lights that glistened in it when she moved her head slightly, and had to give his own head a little shake to clear it
[27024]0   
[27025]0   
[27026]0   
[27027]6847    the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards was Pierre Bonaccord, but his appointment was contested by the wizarding community of Liechtenstein, because-All around Harry quills were scratching on parchment like scurrying, burrowing rats
[27028]562    The sun was very hot on the back of his head
[27029]119    What was it that Bonaccord had done to offend the wizards of Liechtenstein
[27030]5915   Harry had a feeling it had something to do with trolls 
[27031]0   
[27032]0   
[27033]5335    he gazed blankly at the back of Parvati's head again
[27034]970    If he could only perform Legilimency and open a window in the back of her head and see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between Pierre Bonaccord and Liechtenstein 
[27035]0   
[27036]0   
[27037]7502   Harry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands, so that the glowing red of his eyelids grew dark and cool
[27038]345    Bonaccord had wanted to stop troll-hunting and give the trolls rights 
[27039]0   
[27040]0   
[27041]182    but Liechtenstein was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain trolls 
[27042]0   
[27043]0   
[27044]0    that was it
[27045]968   He opened his eyes; they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing white parchment
[27046]453    Slowly, he wrote two lines about the trolls, then read through what he had done so far
[27047]7475    It did not seem very informative or detailed, yet he was sure Hermione's notes on the Confederation had gone on for pages and pages
[27048]1153   He closed his eyes again, trying to see them, trying to remember 
[27049]0   
[27050]0   
[27051]968    the Confederation had met for the first time in France, yes, he had written that already

[27057]39    he had written that, too 
[27058]0   
[27059]0   
[27060]615   And nobody from Liechtenstein had wanted to come 
[27061]0   
[27062]0   
[27063]1804   Think, he told himself, his face in his hands, while all around him quills scratched out never-ending answers and the sand trickled through the hour-glass at the front

[27065]0   
[27066]888   He was walking along the cool, dark corridor to the Department of Mysteries again, walking with a firm and purposeful tread, breaking occasionally into a run, determined to reach his destination at last 
[27067]0   
[27068]0   
[27069]1680    the black door swung open for him as usual, and here he was in the circular room with its many doors

[27078]2572   He jogged the last few feet to the third door, which swung open just like the others

[27186]11138  'Yes,' said Harry wildly
[27187]231    I mean 
[27188]0   
[27189]0   
[27190]0    no 
[27191]0   
[27192]0   
[27193]1255    I've done-done as much as I can, I think 
[27194]0   
[27195]0   
[27196]5448   'Very well, very well,' said the old wizard gently
[27197]164    I shall go and collect your examination paper and I suggest that you go and have a nice lie down
[27198]11415   'I'll do that,' said Harry, nodding vigorously
[27199]40    Thanks very much
[27200]18708   'The second that the old man's heels disappeared over the threshold into the Great Hall, Harry ran up the marble staircase, hurtled along the corridors so fast the portraits he passed muttered reproaches, up more flights of stairs, and finally burst like a hurricane through the double doors of the hospital wing, causing Madam Pomfrey-who had been spooning some bright blue liquid into Montague's open mouth-to shriek in alarm
[27201]1205   Potter, what do you think you're doing
[27202]7068  'I need to see Professor McGonagall,' gasped Harry, the breath tearing his lungs
[27203]0    Now 
[27204]0   
[27205]0   
[27206]4761    it's urgent
[27207]10451  'She's not here, Potter,' said Madam Pomfrey sadly
[27208]43    She was transferred to St
[27209]4886    Mungo's this morning
[27210]242    Four Stunning Spells straight to the chest at her age
[27211]7572   It's a wonder they didn't kill her
[27212]4750   'She's 
[27213]0   
[27214]0   
[27215]129    gone
[27216]10845  ' said Harry, shocked
[27217]1727   The bell rang just outside the dormitory and he heard the usual distant rumbling of students starting to flood out into the corridors above and below him
[27218]970    He remained quite still, looking at Madam Pomfrey
[27219]249    Terror was rising inside him
[27220]607   There was nobody left to tell
[27221]2813    Dumbledore had gone, Hagrid had gone, but he had always expected Professor McGonagall to be there, irascible and inflexible, perhaps, but always dependably, solidly present 
[27222]0   
[27223]0   
[27224]9304   I don't wonder you're shocked, Potter,' said Madam Pomfrey, with a kind of fierce approval in her face
[27225]822    As if one of them could have Stunned Minerva McGonagall face-on by daylight
[27226]4754   Cowardice, that's what it was 
[27227]0   
[27228]0   
[27229]5    despicable cowardice 
[27230]0   
[27231]0   
[27232]3321    if I wasn't worried what would happen to you students without me, I'd resign in protest
[27233]11132   'Yes,' said Harry blankly
[27234]2579   He wheeled around and strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor where he stood, buffeted by the crowd, panic expanding inside him like poison gas so that his head swam and he could not think what to do 
[27235]0   
[27236]0   
[27237]9732   Ron and Hermione, said a voice in his head
[27238]654   He was running again, pushing students out of the way, oblivious to their angry protests
[27239]464    He sprinted, back down two floors and was at the top of the marble staircase when he saw them hurrying towards him
[27240]5732   Harry
[27241]7333  ' said Hermione at once, looking very frightened
[27242]143    What happened
[27243]557   Are you all right
[27244]18   Are you ill
[27245]0  'Where have you been
[27246]2031  ' demanded Ron
[27247]11409   Come with me,' Harry said quickly
[27248]2151    Come on, I've got to tell you something
[27249]5200   'He led them along the first-floor corridor, peering through doorways, and at last found an empty classroom into which he dived, closing the door behind Ron and Hermione the moment they were inside, and leaned against it, facing them
[27250]1339   Voldemorts got Sirius

[27258]7303  ' said Hermione, whose face was white
[27259]10862   I dunno how,' said Harry
[27260]872    But I know exactly where
[27261]6117    There's a room in the Department of Mysteries full of shelves covered in these little glass balls and they're at the end of row ninety-seven

[27272]622    He moved over to a desk and sat down on it, trying to master himself
[27273]489   How're we going to get there
[27274]356  ' he asked them
[27275]5097   There was a moment's silence
[27276]7096    Then Ron said, G-get there
[27277]765  'Get to the Department of Mysteries, so we can rescue Sirius

[27290]0    how

[27294]771  'How do I know

[27296]541    The question is how we're going to get in there

[27301]0   
[27302]0   
[27303]434    the Ministry of Magic must be full of workers

[27307]5732   Harry 
[27308]0   
[27309]0   
[27310]403    they're probably the two most wanted wizards in the world 
[27311]0   
[27312]0   
[27313]590    you think they could get into a building full of Aurors undetected
[27314]472  'I dunno, Voldemort used an Invisibility Cloak or something
[27315]5867  ' Harry shouted
[27316]14128    Anyway, the Department of Mysteries has always been completely empty whenever I've been-'You've never been there, Harry,' said Hermione quietly
[27317]5642    You've dreamed about the place, that's all
[27318]65   'They're not normal dreams
[27319]6811  ' Harry shouted in her face, standing up and taking a step closer to her in turn
[27320]187    He wanted to shake her
[27321]8378    How d'you explain Ron's dad then, what was all that about, how come I knew what had happened to him
[27322]14970  'He's got a point,' said Ron quietly, looking at Hermione
[27323]1623   But this is just -just so unlikely
[27324]6734  ' said Hermione desperately
[27325]12916    Harry, how on earth could Voldemort have got hold of Sirius when he's been in Grimmauld Place all the time
[27326]9697  'Sirius might've cracked and just wanted some fresh air,' said Ron, sounding worried
[27327]8191    He's been desperate to get out of that house for ages-'But why,' Hermione persisted, why on earth would Voldemort want to use Sirius to get the weapon, or whatever the thing is
[27328]77  'I dunno, there could be loads of reasons
[27329]5811  ' Harry yelled at her
[27330]14662    Maybe Sirius is just someone Voldemort doesn't care about seeing hurt-'You know what, I've just thought of something,' said Ron in a hushed voice
[27331]8082    Sirius's brother was a Death Eater, wasn't he
[27332]1113   Maybe he told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon
[27333]11844  'Yeah-and that's why Dumbledore's been so keen to keep Sirius locked up all the time
[27334]10818  ' said Harry
[27335]17356   Look, I'm sorry,' cried Hermione, but neither of you is making sense, and we've got no proof for any of this, no proof Voldemort and Sirius are even there-'Hermione, Harry's seen them
[27336]7096  ' said Ron, rounding on her
[27337]8293   OK,' she said, looking frightened yet determined, I've just got to say this-'What
[27338]0  'You 
[27339]0

[27384]39455  I mean, it was really great of you and everything,' said Hermione quickly, looking positively petrified at the look on Harry's face, everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do-'That's funny,' said Harry through gritted teeth, because I definitely remember Ron saying I'd wasted time acting the hero 
[27385]0   
[27386]0   
[27387]562    is that what you think this is
[27388]423   You reckon I want to act the hero again

[27391]4981    That's not what I mean at all
[27392]2222  'Well, spit out what you've got to say, because we're wasting time here
[27393]5867  ' Harry shouted
[27394]6974   I'm trying to say -Voldemort knows you, Harry
[27395]12060   He took Ginny down into the Chamber of Secrets to lure you there, it's the kind of thing he does, he knows you're the-the sort of person who'd go to Sirius's aid
[27396]5860   What if he's just trying to get you into the Department of Myst-
[27397]9935  'Hermione, it doesn't matter if he's done it to get me there or not-they've taken McGonagall to St
[27398]11872    Mungo's, there isn't anyone from the Order left at Hogwarts who we can tell, and if we don't go, Sirius is dead
[27399]6652  ' But Harry-what if your dream was-was just that, a dream
[27400]6076  'Harry let out a roar of frustration
[27401]2351    Hermione actually stepped back from him, looking alarmed
[27402]2941   You don't get it
[27403]7675  ' Harry shouted at her, I'm not having nightmares, I'm not just dreaming
[27404]3577   What d'you think all the Occlumency was for, why d'you think Dumbledore wanted me prevented from seeing these things
[27405]3210   Because they're REAL, Hermione-Sirius is trapped, I've seen him
[27406]10222    Voldemort's got him, and no one else knows, and that means we're the only ones who can save him, and if you don't want to do it, fine, but I'm going, understand
[27407]10618   And if I remember rightly, you didn't have a problem with my saving-people thing when it was you I was saving from the dementors, or-he rounded on Ron-when it was your sister I was saving from the Basilisk-'I never said I had a problem
[27408]7094  ' said Ron heatedly
[27409]28893   But Harry, you've just said it,' said Hermione fiercely, Dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind, if you'd done Occlumency properly you'd never have seen this-'IF YOU THINK I'M JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE I HAVEN'T SEEN-'Sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learning to close your mind
[27410]3411  'WELL, I EXPECT HE'D SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF HE KNEW WHAT I'D JUST-' The classroom door opened
[27411]9362    Harry, Ron and Hermione whipped around
[27412]2227    Ginny walked in, looking curious, closely followed by Luna, who as usual looked as though she had drifted in accidentally
[27413]5465   Hi,' said Ginny uncertainly
[27414]11047    We recognised Harry's voice
[27415]16    What are you yelling about
[27416]10977  'Never you mind,' said Harry roughly
[27417]503   Ginny raised her eyebrows
[27418]10257   There's no need to take that tone with me,' she said coolly, I was only wondering whether I could help
[27419]13157   'Well, you can't,' said Harry shortly
[27420]6024   You're being rather rude, you know,' said Luna serenely
[27421]6415   Harry swore and turned away
[27422]558    The very last thing he wanted now was a conversation with Luna Lovegood
[27423]6881   Wait,' said Hermione suddenly
[27424]77    Wait 
[27425]0   
[27426]0   
[27427]5877    Harry, they can help
[27428]8410   ' Harry and Ron looked at her
[27429]12331   Listen,' she said urgently, Harry, we need to establish whether Sirius really has left Headquarters
[27430]7518   'I've told you, I saw-'Harry, I'm begging you, please
[27431]6734  ' said Hermione desperately
[27432]9072    Please let's just check that Sirius isn't at home before we go charging off to London
[27433]7431    If we find out he's not there, then I swear I won't try to stop you
[27434]2330    I'll come, I'll d-do whatever it takes to try and save him
[27435]657   'Sirius is being tortured NOW
[27436]5867  ' shouted Harry
[27437]3696    We haven't got time to waste
[27438]13525   'But if this is a trick of Voldemort's, Harry, we've got to check, we've got to
[27439]0   'How
[27440]5761  ' Harry demanded
[27441]524    How're we going to check
[27442]13826  'We'll have to use Umbridge's fire and see if we can contact him, said Hermione, who looked positively terrified at the thought
[27443]7584    We'll draw Umbridge away again, but we'll need lookouts, and that's where we can use Ginny and Luna
[27444]13295   'Though clearly struggling to understand what was going on, Ginny said immediately, Yeah, we'll do it,' and Luna said, When you say Sirius", are you talking about Stubby Boardman
[27445]16  'Nobody answered her
[27446]15898   OK,' Harry said aggressively to Hermione, OK, if you can think of a way of doing this quickly, I'm with you, otherwise I'm going to the Department of Mysteries right now
[27447]112   'The Department of Mysteries
[27448]5886  ' said Luna, looking mildly surprised
[27449]489    But how are you going to get there
[27450]5755  'Again, Harry ignored her
[27451]7468   Right,' said Hermione, twisting her hands together and pacing up and down between the desks
[27452]557    Right 
[27453]0   
[27454]0   
[27455]0    well 
[27456]0

[27458]1224    one of us has to go and find Umbridge and-and send her off in the wrong direction, keep her away from her office

[27460]0   
[27461]0   
[27462]7655   'I'll do it,' said Ron at once
[27463]6339    I'll tell her Peeves is smashing up the Transfiguration department or something, it's miles away from her office
[27464]1551    Come to think of it, I could probably persuade Peeves to do it if I met him on the way
[27465]1751   'It was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made no objection to the smashing up of the Transfiguration department
[27466]5273   OK,' she said, her brow furrowed as she continued to pace
[27467]6408    Now, we need to keep students right away from her office while we force entry, or some Slytherin's bound to go and tip her off
[27468]11405   'Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,' said Ginny promptly, and warn people not to go down there because someone's let off a load of Garrotting Gas
[27469]9674   ' Hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie; Ginny shrugged and said, Fred and George were planning to do it before they left
[27470]6783   'OK,' said Hermione
[27471]13740    Well then, Harry, you and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak and we'll sneak into the office and you can talk to Sirius-'He's not there, Hermione
[27472]9500  'I mean, you can -can check whether Sirius is at home or not while I keep watch, I don't think you should be in there alone, Lee's already proved the windows a weak spot, sending those Nifflers through it
[27473]17742   'Even through his anger and impatience, Harry recognised Hermione's offer to accompany him into Umbridge's office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty
[27474]0   I 
[27475]0   
[27476]0   
[27477]229    OK, thanks,' he muttered
[27478]18041   Right, well, even if we do all of that, I don't think we're going to be able to bank on more than five minutes,' said Hermione, looking relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan, not with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around
[27479]16626   'Five minutes'll be enough,' said Harry C'mon, let's go-'Now
[27480]7333  ' said Hermione, looking shocked
[27481]217   Of course now
[27482]10901  ' said Harry angrily
[27483]1857    What did you think, we're going to wait until after dinner or something
[27484]2829   Hermione, Sirius is being tortured right now
[27485]6038  'I-oh, all right,' she said desperately
[27486]6487    You go and get the Invisibility Cloak and we'll meet you at the end of Umbridge's corridor, OK
[27487]9626  'Harry didn't answer, but flung himself out of the room and began to fight his way through the milling crowds outside
[27488]1396    Two floors up he met Seamus and Dean, who hailed him jovially and told him they were planning a dusk-till-dawn end-of-exams celebration in the common room
[27489]6067    Harry barely heard them
[27490]6518    He scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many black-market Butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it, the Invisibility Cloak and Sirius's knife secure in his bag, before they noticed he had left them
[27491]6767   Harry, d'you want to chip in a couple of Galleons
[27492]16421   Harold Dingle reckons he could sell us some Firewhisky-'But Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor, and a couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Luna, who were huddled together at the end of Umbridge's corridor
[27493]705   Got it,' he panted
[27494]80    Ready to go, then
[27495]2691  'All right,' whispered Hermione as a gang of loud sixth-years passed them
[27496]3063    So Ron-you go and head Umbridge off 
[27497]0   
[27498]0   
[27499]1084    Ginny, Luna, if you can start moving people out of the corridor 
[27500]0

[27505]14232   'Ron strode away, his bright-red hair visible right to the end of the passage; meanwhile Ginny's equally vivid head bobbed between the jostling students surrounding them in the other direction, trailed by Luna's blonde one
[27506]13292   Get over here,' muttered Hermione, tugging at Harry's wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column
[27507]6041    Are-are you sure you're OK, Harry
[27508]50   You're still very pale
[27509]5845   'I'm fine,' he said shortly, tugging the Invisibility Cloak from out of his bag
[27510]1821    In truth, his scar was aching, but not so badly that he thought Voldemort had yet dealt Sirius a fatal blow; it had hurt much worse than this when Voldemort had been punishing Avery 
[27511]0   
[27512]0   
[27513]5554   Here,' he said; he threw the Invisibility Cloak over both of them and they stood listening carefully over the Latin mumblings of the bust in front of them
[27514]2744   You can't come down here
[27515]448  ' Ginny was calling to the crowd
[27516]15103    No, sorry, you're going to have to go round by the swivelling staircase, someone's let off Garrotting Gas just along here-'They could hear people complaining; one surly voice said, I can't see no gas
[27517]19064   'That's because it's colourless,' said Ginny in a convincingly exasperated voice, but if you want to walk through it, carry on, then we'll have your body as proof for the next idiot who doesn't believe us
[27518]222   'Slowly, the crowd thinned
[27519]860    The news about the Garrotting Gas seemed to have spread; people were not coming this way any more
[27520]24503    When at last the surrounding area was quite clear, Hermione said quietly, I think that's as good as we're going to get, Harry-come on, let's do it
[27521]293   'They moved forwards, covered by the Cloak
[27522]773    Luna was standing with her back to them at the far end of the corridor
[27523]2532    As they passed Ginny, Hermione whispered, Good one 
[27524]0   
[27525]0   
[27526]2975    don't forget the signal
[27527]4760   'What's the signal
[27528]11682  ' muttered Harry, as they approached Umbridge's door
[27529]14894   A loud chorus of Weasley is our King if they see Umbridge coming,' replied Hermione, as Harry inserted the blade of Sirius's knife in the crack between door and wall
[27530]527    The lock clicked open and they entered the office
[27531]850   The garish kittens were basking in the late-afternoon sunshine that was warming their plates, but otherwise the office was as still and unoccupied as last time
[27532]1683    Hermione breathed a sigh of relief
[27533]686   I thought she might have added extra security after the second Niffler
[27534]2853   ' They pulled off the Cloak; Hermione hurried over to the window and stood out of sight, peering down into the grounds with her wand out
[27535]6187    Harry dashed over to the fireplace, seized the pot of Floo powder and threw a pinch into the grate, causing emerald flames to burst into life there
[27536]1013    He knelt down quickly, thrust his head into the dancing fire and cried, Number twelve, Grimmauld Place
[27537]2791  'His head began to spin as though he had just got off a fairground ride though his knees remained firmly planted on the cold office floor
[27538]2298    He kept his eyes screwed up against the whirling ash and when the spinning stopped he opened them to find himself looking out at the long, cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place
[27539]0   There was nobody there
[27540]811    He had expected this, yet was not prepared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst through his stomach at the sight of the deserted room
[27541]647   Sirius
[27542]135  ' he shouted
[27543]647    Sirius, are you there
[27544]1811  'His voice echoed around the room, but there was no answer except a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire
[27545]4750   Who's there
[27546]970  ' he called, wondering whether it was just a mouse
[27547]481   Kreacher the house-elf crept into view
[27548]1005    He looked highly delighted about something, though he seemed to have recently sustained a nasty injury to both hands, which were heavily bandaged
[27549]16574   It's the Potter boy's head in the fire,' Kreacher informed the empty kitchen, stealing furtive, oddly triumphant glances at Harry
[27550]558    What has he come for, Kreacher wonders
[27551]5515  'Where's Sirius, Kreacher
[27552]5761  ' Harry demanded
[27553]546   The house-elf gave a wheezy chuckle
[27554]6364   Master has gone out, Harry Potter
[27555]4879   'Where's he gone
[27556]4997   Where's he gone, Kreacher
[27557]168  'Kreacher merely cackled
[27558]470   I'm warning you
[27559]11040  ' said Harry, fully aware that his scope for inflicting punishment upon Kreacher was almost non-existent in this position
[27560]164    What about Lupin
[27561]241   Mad-Eye
[27562]0   Any of them, are any of them there
[27563]118  'Nobody here but Kreacher
[27564]12458  ' said the elf gleefully, and turning away from Harry he began to walk slowly towards the door at the end of the kitchen
[27565]10167    Kreacher thinks he will have a little chat with his mistress now, yes, he hasn't had a chance in a long time, Kreacher's master has been keeping him away from her-'Where has Sirius gone
[27566]5909  ' Harry yelled after the elf
[27567]359    Kreacher, has he gone to the Department of Mysteries
[27568]246  'Kreacher stopped in his tracks
[27569]7546    Harry could just make out the back of his bald head through the forest of chair legs before him
[27570]6421   Master does not tell poor Kreacher where he is going,' said the elf quietly
[27571]771   But you know
[27572]5867  ' shouted Harry
[27573]2941    Don't you
[27574]771   You know where he is
[27575]5521  'There was a moment's silence, then the elf let out his loudest cackle yet
[27576]590   Master will not come back from the Department of Mysteries
[27577]5097  ' he said gleefully
[27578]127    Kreacher and his mistress are alone again
[27579]810  'And he scurried forwards and disappeared through the door to the hall
[27580]0   You-'
[27581]10263  'But before he could utter a single curse or insult, Harry felt a great pain at the top of his head; he inhaled a lot of ash and, choking, found himself being dragged backwards through the flames, until with a horrible abruptness he was staring up into the wide, pallid face of Professor Umbridge who had dragged him backwards out of the fire by the hair and was now bending his neck back as far as it would go, as though she were going to slit his throat
[27582]13275   You think,' she whispered, bending Harry's neck back even further, so that he was looking up at the ceiling, that after two Nifflers I was going to let one more foul, scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge
[27583]948   I had Stealth Sensoring Spells placed all around my doorway after the last one got in, you foolish boy
[27584]1940    Take his wand,' she barked at someone he could not see, and he felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robes and remove the wand
[27585]0    Hers, too
[27586]9614   'Harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that Hermione had also just had her wand wrested from her
[27587]7265   I want to know why you are in my office,' said Umbridge, shaking the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered
[27588]246   I was-trying to get my Firebolt
[27589]5748  ' Harry croaked
[27590]10   Liar
[27591]556   ' She shook his head again
[27592]1293    Your Firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeons, as you very well know, Potter
[27593]490    You had your head in my fire
[27594]4    With whom have you been communicating
[27595]11420  'No one-' said Harry, trying to pull away from her
[27596]311    He felt several hairs part company with his scalp
[27597]10   Liar
[27598]706  ' shouted Umbridge
[27599]230    She threw him from her and he slammed into the desk
[27600]1781    Now he could see Hermione pinioned against the wall by Millicent Bulstrode
[27601]11744    Malfoy was leaning on the windowsill, smirking as he threw Harry's wand into the air one-handed and caught it again
[27602]14557   There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins entered, each gripping Ron, Ginny, Luna and-to Harry's bewilderment-Neville, who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation
[27603]3    All four of them had been gagged
[27604]8365   Got em all,' said Warrington, shoving Ron roughly forwards into the room
[27605]1943    That one,' he poked a thick finger at Neville, tried to stop me taking her,' he pointed at Ginny, who was trying to kick the shins of the large Slytherin girl holding her, so I brought him along too
[27606]11572   'Good, good,' said Umbridge, watching Ginny's struggles
[27607]3473    Well, it looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasley-free zone, doesn't it
[27608]629  'Malfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically
[27609]1852    Umbridge gave her wide, complacent smile and settled herself into a chintz-covered armchair, blinking up at her captives like a toad in a flowerbed
[27610]5547   So, Potter,' she said
[27611]4276    You stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon,' she nodded at Ron-Malfoy laughed even louder-'to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes- Mr
[27612]1030    Filch having just informed me so
[27613]295   'Clearly, it was very important for you to talk to somebody
[27614]838    Was it Albus Dumbledore
[27615]831   Or the half-breed, Hagrid
[27616]629   I doubt it was Minerva McGonagall, I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone
[27617]552   'Malfoy and a few of the other members of the Inquisitorial Squad laughed some more at that
[27618]5866    Harry found he was so full of rage and hatred he was shaking
[27619]4945   It's none of your business who I talk to,' he snarled
[27620]5850   Umbridge's slack face seemed to tighten
[27621]5693   Very well,' she said in her most dangerous and falsely sweet voice
[27622]372    Very well, Mr
[27623]461    Potter 
[27624]0   
[27625]0   
[27626]406    I offered you the chance to tell me freely
[27627]8    You refused
[27628]41    I have no alternative but to force you
[27629]1300    Draco- fetch Professor Snape
[27630]18279   'Malfoy slowed Harry's wand inside his robes and left the room smirking, but Harry hardly noticed
[27631]1054    He had just realised something; he could not believe he had been so stupid as to forget it
[27632]1613    He had thought that all the members of the Order, all those who could help him save Sirius, were gone-but he had been wrong
[27633]961    There was still a member of the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts-Snape
[27634]2339   There was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resulting from the Slytherins' efforts to keep Ron and the others under control
[27635]25750    Ron's lip was bleeding on to Umbridge's carpet as he struggled against Warrington's half-nelson; Ginny was still trying to stamp on the feel of the sixth-year girl who had both her upper arms in a tight grip; Neville was turning steadily more purple in the face while lugging at Crabbe's arms; and Hermione was attempting, in vain, to throw Millicent Bulstrode off her
[27636]575    Luna, however, stood limply by the side of her captor, gazing vaguely out of the window as though rather bored by the proceedings
[27637]7177   Harry looked back at Umbridge, who was watching him closely
[27638]2935    He kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and Draco Malfoy entered the room, closely followed by Snape
[27639]187   You wanted to see me, Headmistress
[27640]6449  ' said Snape, looking around at all the pairs of struggling students with an expression of complete indifference
[27641]7172   Ah, Professor Snape,' said Umbridge, smiling widely and standing up again
[27642]1107    Yes, I would like another bottle of Veritaserum, as quick as you can, please
[27643]6272   ' You took my last bottle to interrogate Potter,' he said, surveying her coolly through his greasy curtains of black hair
[27644]799    Surely you did not use it all
[27645]335   I told you that three drops would be sufficient
[27646]581   'Umbridge flushed
[27647]2512   You can make some more, can't you
[27648]6340  ' she said, her voice becoming more sweetly girlish as it always did when she was furious
[27649]5632   Certainly,' said Snape, his lip curling
[27650]158    It takes a full moon-cycle to mature, so I should have it ready for you in around a month
[27651]37   'A month
[27652]17  ' squawked Umbndge, swelling toadishly
[27653]37    A month
[27654]745  But I need it this evening, Snape
[27655]1387   I have just found Potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown
[27656]288  'Really
[27657]12219  ' said Snape, showing his first, faint sign of interest as he looked round at Harry
[27658]2458    Well, it doesn't surprise me
[27659]750    Potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules
[27660]12737   'His cold, dark eyes were boring into Harry's, who met his gaze unflinchingly, concentrating hard on what he had seen in his dream, willing Snape to read it in his mind, to understand 
[27661]0   
[27662]0   
[27663]51   I wish to interrogate him
[27664]8009  ' repeated Umbridge angrily, and Snape looked away from Harry back into her furiously quivering lace
[27665]524    I wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me the truth
[27666]5912  'I have already told you,' said Snape smoothly, that I have no further stocks of Veritaserum
[27667]1394    Unless you wish to poison Potter-and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy with you if you did-I cannot help you
[27668]322    The only trouble is that most venoms act too fast to give the victim much lime for truth-telling
[27669]7131   'Snape looked back at Harry, who stared at him, frantic to communicate without words
[27670]6853   Voldemort's got Sirius in the Department of Mysteries, he thought desperately
[27671]6330    Voldemort's got Sirius-'You are on probation
[27672]2838  ' shrieked Professor Umbridge, and Snape looked back at her, his eyebrows slightly raised
[27673]15    You arc being deliberately unhelpful
[27674]753   I expected better, Lucius Malfoy always speaks most highly of you
[27675]170   Now get out of my office
[27676]1185  'Snape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave
[27677]8050    Harry knew his last chance of letting the Order know what was going on was walking out of the door
[27678]5445   He's got Padfoot
[27679]135  ' he shouted
[27680]10418    He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden
[27681]6792  'Snape had stopped with his hand on Umbridge's door handle
[27682]5   Padfoot
[27683]8230  ' cried Professor Umbridge, looking eagerly from Harry to Snape
[27684]5    What is Padfoot
[27685]40   Where what is hidden
[27686]800   What does he mean, Snape
[27687]7013  'Snape looked round at Harry
[27688]522    His face was inscrutable
[27689]7439    Harry could not tell whether he had understood or not, but he did not dare speak more plainly in front of Umbridge
[27690]5709   I have no idea,' said Snape coldly
[27691]942    Potter, when I want nonsense shouted at me I shall give you a Babbling Beverage
[27692]417    And Crabbe, loosen your hold a little
[27693]495    If Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job
[27694]7036   'He closed the door behind him with a snap, leaving Harry in a state of worse turmoil than before: Snape had been his very last hope
[27695]1872    He looked at Umbridge, who seemed to be feeling the same way; her chest was heaving with rage and frustration
[27696]5667   Very well,' she said, and she pulled out her wand
[27697]0    Very well 
[27698]0

[27715]144   'She seemed to be talking herself into something
[27716]13169    She was shifting her weight nervously from foot to foot, staring at Harry, beating her wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily As he watched her, Harry felt horribly powerless without his own wand
[27717]471   You are forcing me, Potter 
[27718]0   
[27719]0   
[27720]6239    I do not want to,' said Umbridge, still moving restlessly on the spot, but sometimes circumstances justify the use

[27727]5919   The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue,' said Umbridge quietly
[27728]0   No
[27729]1644  ' shrieked Hermione
[27730]6086    Professor Umbridge-it's illegal
[27731]815   'But Umbridge took no notice
[27732]6952    There was a nasty eager, excited look on her face that Harry had never seen before
[27733]531    She raised her wand
[27734]4197   The Minister wouldn't want you to break the law, Professor Umbridge
[27735]1655  ' cried Hermione
[27736]23113   What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him,' said Umbridge, who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different parts of Harry's body in turn, apparently trying to decide where it would hurt most
[27737]1059    He never knew I ordered dementors to go after Potter last summer, but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him, all the same
[27738]0   'It was you
[27739]5772  ' gasped Harry
[27740]161    You sent the dementors after me
[27741]12060  'Somebody had to act,' breathed Umbridge, as her wand came to rest pointing directly at Harry's forehead
[27742]724    They were all bleating about silencing you somehow-discrediting you -but I was the one who actually did something about it 
[27743]0   
[27744]0   
[27745]3172    only you wriggled out of that one, didn't you, Potter
[27746]396   Not today though, not now-' And taking a deep breath, she cried, Cruc-'NO
[27747]2331  ' shouted Hermione in a cracked voice from behind Millicent Bulstrode
[27748]6631    No-Harry- we'll have to tell her
[27749]355  'No way
[27750]7892  ' yelled Harry, staring at the little of Hermione he could see
[27751]11651   We'll have to, Harry, she'll force it out of you anyway, what's 
[27752]0   
[27753]0   
[27754]4835    what's the point
[27755]6688  'And Hermione began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bulstrode's robes
[27756]1533    Millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted
[27757]0   Well, well, well

[27759]905    Little Miss Question-all is going to give us some answers

[27763]2311   Ginny was staring at Hermione as though she had never seen her before
[27764]458    Neville, still choking for breath, was gazing at her, too
[27765]6613    But Harry had just noticed something
[27766]1858    Though Hermione was sobbing desperately into her hands, there was no trace of a tear
[27767]7678   I'm-I'm sorry everyone,' said Hermione
[27768]13051    But-I can't stand it-' That's right, that's right, girl

[27772]0   
[27773]1273    with whom was Potter communicating just now

[27775]9042   'Ron froze, his eyes wide; Ginny stopped trying to stamp on her Slytherin captor's toes; and even Luna looked mildly surprised
[27776]2323    Fortunately, the attention of Umbridge and her minions was focused too exclusively upon Hermione to notice these suspicious signs
[27777]817   Dumbledore

[27787]418   But-but we needed to tell him something important
[27788]8609  ' wailed Hermione, holding her hands more tightly over her face, not, Harry knew, out of anguish, but to disguise the continued absence of tears
[27789]292   Yes

[27802]0

[27806]6167  ' said Umbridge, and her eyes seemed to pop with excitement
[27807]13    You have been developing some method of resistance
[27808]356   A weapon you could use against the Ministry
[27809]6549   On Professor Dumbledore's orders, of course
[27810]10290  ' Y-y-yes,' gasped Hermione, but he had to leave before it was finished and n-n-now we've finished it for him, and we c-c-can't find him t-t-to tell him
[27811]121  'What kind of weapon is it
[27812]12279  ' said Umbridge harshly, her stubby hands still tight on Hermione's shoulders
[27813]10181   We don't r-r- really understand it,' said Hermione, sniffing loudly
[27814]8141    We j-j-just did what P-P-Professor Dumbledore told us t-t-to do
[27815]1197   'Umbridge straightened up, looking exultant
[27816]5143   Lead me to the weapon,' she said
[27817]474   I'm not showing 
[27818]0   
[27819]0   
[27820]7427    them,' said Hermione shrilly, looking around at the Slytherins through her fingers
[27821]6555   It is not for you to set conditions,' said Professor Umbridge harshly
[27822]6963   Fine,' said Hermione, now sobbing into her hands again
[27823]75    Fine 
[27824]0   
[27825]0   
[27826]485    let them see it, I hope they use it on you
[27827]1561   In fact, I wish you'd invite loads and loads of people to come and see
[27828]7700   Th-that would serve you right-oh, I'd love it if the wh- whole school knew where it was, and how to u-use it, and then if you annoy any of them they'll, be able to s-sort you out
[27829]3126  'These words had a powerful impact on Umbridge: she glanced swiftly and suspiciously around at her Inquisitorial Squad, her bulging eyes resting for a moment on Malfoy, who was too slow to disguise the look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face
[27830]3870   Umbridge contemplated Hermione for another long moment, then spoke in what she clearly thought was a motherly voice
[27831]6729   All right, dear, let's make it just you and me 
[27832]0   
[27833]0   
[27834]1028    and we'll take Potter, too, shall we
[27835]0   Get up, now
[27836]10678   'Professor,' said Malfoy eagerly, Professor Umbridge, I think some of the Squad should come with you to look after-'I am a fully qualified Ministry official, Malfoy, do you really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone
[27837]982  ' asked Umbridge sharply
[27838]288    In any case, it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see
[27839]3333    You will remain here until I return and make sure none of these-' she gestured around at Ron, Ginny, Neville and Luna -escape
[27840]6708   ' All right,' said Malfoy, looking sulky and disappointed
[27841]13919   And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way,' said Umbridge, pointing at Harry and Hermione with her wand

[27855]7511     Harry had no idea what Hermione was planning, or even whether she had a plan
[27856]7962    He walked half a pace behind her as they headed down the corridor outside Umbridge's office, knowing it would look very suspicious if he appeared not to know where they were going
[27857]1766    He did not dare attempt to talk to her; Umbridge was walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged breathing
[27858]2364   Hermione led the way down the stairs into the Entrance Hall
[27859]7884    The din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out of the double doors to the Great Hall-it seemed incredible to Harry that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner, celebrating the end of exams, not a care in the world 
[27860]0   
[27861]0   
[27862]2404   Hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air
[27863]3972    The sun was falling towards the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now, and as Hermione marched purposefully across the grass-Umbridge jogging to keep up-their long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks
[27864]10196   It's hidden in Hagrid's hut, is it
[27865]16251  ' said Umbridge eagerly in Harry's ear
[27866]6923   Of course not,' said Hermione scathingly
[27867]799    Hagrid might have set it off accidentally
[27868]5983   'Yes,' said Umbridge, whose excitement seemed to be mounting
[27869]948    Yes, he would have done, of course, the great half-breed oaf
[27870]52   'She laughed
[27871]6231    Harry felt a strong urge to swing round and seize her by the throat, but resisted
[27872]1191    His scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned white-hot, as he knew it would if Voldemort had moved in for the kill
[27873]10   Th en 
[27874]0   
[27875]0   
[27876]0    where is it
[27877]3297   asked Umbridge, with a hint or uncertainty in her voice as Hermione continued to stride towards the Forest
[27878]7398   In there, of course,' said Hermione, pointing into the dark trees
[27879]5712    It had to be somewhere that students weren't going to find it accidentally, didn't it
[27880]6225  ' Of course,' said Umbridge, though she sounded a little apprehensive now
[27881]217    Of course 
[27882]0   
[27883]0   
[27884]0    very well, then 
[27885]0   
[27886]0   
[27887]124    you two stay ahead of me
[27888]898   'Can we have your wand, then, if we're going first
[27889]6088  ' Harry asked her
[27890]3875   No, I don't think so, Mr
[27891]6148    Potter,' said Umbridge sweetly, poking him in the back with it
[27892]815    The Ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours, I'm afraid
[27893]13124   'As they reached the cool shade of the first trees, Harry tried to catch Hermione's eye; walking into the Forest without wands seemed to him to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening
[27894]1870    She, however, merely gave Umbridge a contemptuous glance and plunged straight into the trees, moving at such a pace that Umbridge, with her shorter legs, had difficulty in keeping up
[27895]140   Is it very far in
[27896]957  ' Umbridge asked, as her robe ripped on a bramble
[27897]12437   Oh yes,' said Hermione, yes, it's well hidden
[27898]10488   'Harry's misgivings increased
[27899]2390    Hermione was not taking the path they had followed to visit Grawp, but the one he followed three years ago to the lair of the monster Aragog
[27900]2071    Hermione had not been with him on that occasion; he doubted she had any idea what danger lay at the end of it
[27901]1260   Er-are you sure this is the right way
[27902]357  ' he asked her pointedly
[27903]6756   Oh yes,' she said in a steely voice, crashing through the undergrowth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of noise
[27904]605    Behind them, Umbridge tripped over a fallen sapling
[27905]7096    Neither of them paused to help her up again; Hermione merely strode on, calling loudly over her shoulder, It's a bit further in
[27906]8071  'Hermione, keep your voice down,' Harry muttered, hurrying to catch up with her
[27907]1398    Anything could be listening in here-'I want us heard,' she answered quietly, as Umbridge jogged noisily after them
[27908]567    You'll see 
[27909]0   
[27910]0   
[27911]1464   'They walked on for what seemed a long time, until they were once again so deep into the Forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all light
[27912]6580    Harry had the feeling he had had before in the Forest, one of being watched by unseen eyes
[27913]0   How much further
[27914]683  ' demanded Umbridge angrily from behind him
[27915]140   Not far now
[27916]1825  ' shouted Hermione, as they emerged into a dim, dank clearing
[27917]2925    Just a little bit -'An arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in the tree just over her head
[27918]8965    The air was suddenly full of the sound of hooves; Harry could feel the Forest floor trembling; Umbridge gave a little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield-He wrenched himself free of her and turned
[27919]8243    Around fifty centaurs were emerging on every side, their bows raised and loaded, pointing at Harry, Hermione and Umbridge
[27920]1132    They backed slowly into the centre of the clearing, Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror
[27921]8072    Harry looked sideways at Hermione
[27922]189    She was wearing a triumphant smile
[27923]0   Who are you
[27924]5625  ' said a voice
[27925]6683   Harry looked left
[27926]1125    The chestnut-bodied centaur called Magorian was walking towards them out of the circle: his bow, like those of the others, was raised
[27927]12198    On Harry's right, Umbridge was still whimpering, her wand trembling violently as she pointed it at the advancing centaur
[27928]5504   I asked you who are you, human,' said Magorian roughly
[27929]602   I am Dolores Umbridge
[27930]6361  ' said Umbridge in a high-pitched, terrified voice
[27931]681    Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic and Headmistress and High Inquisitor of Hogwarts
[27932]432  'You are from the Ministry of Magic
[27933]5193  ' said Magorian, as many of the centaurs in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly
[27934]5307   That's right
[27935]6248  ' said Umbridge, in an even higher voice, so be very careful
[27936]1240   By the laws laid down by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, any attack by half-breeds such as yourselves on a human-' What did you call us
[27937]6800  ' shouted a wild-looking black centaur, whom Harry recognised as Bane
[27938]409    There was a great deal of angry muttering and tightening of bowstrings around them
[27939]2941   Don't call them that
[27940]8274  ' Hermione said furiously, but Umbridge did not appear to have heard her
[27941]1219    Still pointing her shaking wand at Magorian, she continued, Law Fifteen B states clearly that any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near-human intelligence, and therefore considered responsible for its actions-'"Near-human intelligence"
[27942]275  ' repeated Magorian, as Bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground
[27943]304    We consider that a great insult, human
[27944]150   Our intelligence, thankfully, far outstrips your own
[27945]292   'What are you doing in our Forest
[27946]7966  ' bellowed the hard-faced grey centaur Harry and Hermione had seen on their last trip into the Forest
[27947]0    Why are you here
[27948]110  'Your Forest
[27949]5768  ' said Umbridge, shaking now not only with fright but also, it seemed, with indignation
[27950]2747    I would remind you that you live here only because the Ministry of Magic permits you certain areas of land-'An arrow flew so close to her head that it caught at her mousy hair in passing: she let out an ear-splitting scream and threw her hands over her head, while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and others laughed raucously
[27951]413    The sound of their wild, neighing laughter echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely unnerving
[27952]147   Whose Forest is it now, human
[27953]46  ' bellowed Bane
[27954]206   Filthy half-breeds
[27955]730  ' she screamed, her hands still tight over her head
[27956]7    Beasts
[27957]6   Uncontrolled animals
[27958]41  'Be quiet
[27959]2911  ' shouted Hermione, but it was too late: Umbridge pointed her wand at Magorian and screamed, Incarcerous
[27960]6231  'Ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes, wrapping themselves tightly around the centaur's torso and trapping his arms: he gave a cry of rage and reared on to his hind legs, attempting to free himself, while the other centaurs charged
[27961]9280   Harry grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the ground; face down on the Forest floor, he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered around him, but the centaurs leapt over and around them, bellowing and screaming with rage
[27962]2   Nooooo
[27963]855  ' he heard Umbridge shriek
[27964]3    Noooooo 
[27965]0   
[27966]0   
[27967]12    I am Senior Undersecretary 
[27968]0   
[27969]0   
[27970]6    you cannot-Unhand me, you animals 
[27971]0   
[27972]0   
[27973]2    nooooo
[27974]6784  'Harry saw a flash of red light and knew she had attempted to Stun one of them; then she screamed very loudly
[27975]7561    Lifting his head a few inches, Harry saw that Umbridge had been seized from behind by Bane and lifted high into the air, wriggling and yelling with fright
[27976]11648    Her wand fell from her hand to the ground, and Harry's heart leapt
[27977]6658    If he could just reach it-'But as he stretched out a hand towards it, a centaur's hoof descended upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half
[27978]0   Now
[27979]11457  ' roared a voice in Harry's ear and a thick hairy arm descended from thin air and dragged him upright
[27980]2031    Hermione, too, had been pulled to her feet
[27981]7192    Over the plunging, many-coloured backs and heads of the centaurs, Harry saw Umbridge being borne away through the trees by Bane
[27982]1025    Screaming non-stop, her voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves surrounding them
[27983]0   And these
[27984]7072  ' said the hard-faced, grey centaur holding Hermione
[27985]11422   They are young,' said a slow, doleful voice from behind Harry
[27986]68    We do not attack foals
[27987]5860   'They brought her here, Ronan,' replied the centaur who had such a firm grip on Harry
[27988]43    And they are not so young 
[27989]0   
[27990]0   
[27991]2    he is nearing manhood, this one
[27992]6012   'He shook Harry by the neck of his robes
[27993]16756   Please,' said Hermione breathlessly, please, don't attack us, We don't think like her, we aren't Ministry of Magic employees
[27994]900   We only came in here because we hoped you'd drive her off for us
[27995]8935   'Harry knew at once, from the look on the face of the grey centaur holding Hermione, that she had made a terrible mistake in saying this
[27996]805    The grey centaur threw back his head, his back legs stamping furiously, and bellowed, You see, Ronan
[27997]88   They already have the arrogance of their kind
[27998]229   So we were to do your dirty work, were we, human girl
[27999]1151   We were to act as your servants, drive away your enemies like obedient hounds
[28000]0  'No
[28001]6711  ' said Hermione in a horrorstruck squeak
[28002]2939    Please-I didn't mean that
[28003]2355   I just hoped you'd be able to-to help us-'But she seemed to be going from bad to worse
[28004]160   We do not help humans
[28005]17897  ' snarled the centaur holding Harry, tightening his grip and rearing a little at the same time, so that Harry's feet left the ground momentarily
[28006]58    We are a race apart and proud to be so
[28007]729    We will not permit you to walk from here, boasting that we did your bidding
[28008]1493  'We're not going to say anything like that
[28009]5867  ' Harry shouted
[28010]4379    We know you didn't do what you did because we wanted you to-'But nobody seemed to be listening to him
[28011]514   A bearded centaur towards the back of the crowd shouted, They came here unasked, they must pay the consequences
[28012]485  'A roar of approval met these words and a dun-coloured centaur shouted, They can join the woman
[28013]7874  'You said you didn't hurt the innocent
[28014]2387  ' shouted Hermione, real tears sliding down her face now
[28015]7628    We haven't done anything to hurt you, we haven't used wands or threats, we just want to go back to school, please let us go back-'We are not all like the traitor Firenze, human girl
[28016]229  ' shouted the grey centaur, to more neighing roars of approval from his fellows
[28017]580    Perhaps you thought us pretty talking horses
[28018]558   We are an ancient people who will not stand wizard invasions and insults
[28019]9780   We do not recognise your laws, we do not acknowledge your superiority, we are-'But they did not hear what else centaurs were, for at that moment there came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all of them, Harry, Hermione and the fifty or so centaurs filling the clearing, looked around
[28020]11245    Harry's centaur let him fall to the ground again as his hands flew to his bow and quiver of arrows
[28021]7823    Hermione had been dropped, too, and Harry hurried towards her as two thick tree trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the giant appeared in the gap
[28022]1908   The centaurs nearest him backed into those behind; the clearing was now a forest of bows and arrows waiting to be fired, all pointing upwards at the enormous greyish face now looming over them from just beneath the thick canopy of branches
[28023]6234    Grawp's lopsided mouth was gaping stupidly; they could see his bricklike yellow teeth glimmering in the half-light, his dull sludge-coloured eyes narrowed as he squinted down at the creatures at his feet
[28024]65    Broken ropes trailed from both ankles
[28025]361   He opened his mouth even wider
[28026]6   Hagger
[28027]24063   'Harry did not know what hagger' meant, or what language it was from, nor did he much care; he was watching Grawp's feet, which were almost as long as Harry's whole body
[28028]3790    Hermione gripped his arm tightly; the centaurs were quite silent, staring up at the giant, whose huge, round head moved from side to side as he continued to peer amongst them as though looking for something he had dropped
[28029]6   Hagger
[28030]5087  ' he said again, more insistently
[28031]398   Get away from here, giant
[28032]136  ' called Magorian
[28033]26    You are not welcome among us
[28034]397  'These words seemed to make no impression whatsoever on Grawp
[28035]459    He stooped a little (the centaurs' arms tensed on their bows), then bellowed, HAGGER
[28036]763  'A few of the centaurs looked worried now
[28037]1856    Hermione, however, gave a gasp
[28038]5732   Harry
[28039]123  ' she whispered
[28040]6467    I think he's trying to say Hagrid"
[28041]582  ' At this precise moment Grawp caught sight of them, the only two humans in a sea of centaurs
[28042]778    He lowered his head another foot or so, staring intently at them
[28043]13760    Harry could feel Hermione shaking as Grawp opened his mouth wide again and said, in a deep, rumbling voice, Hermy
[28044]18072   'Goodness,' said Hermione, gripping Harry's arm so tightly it was growing numb and looking as though she was about to faint, he-he remembered
[28045]5  'HERMY
[28046]94  ' roared Grawp
[28047]6    WHERE HAGGER
[28048]3712  'I don't know
[28049]1656  ' squealed Hermione, terrified
[28050]4295    I'm sorry, Grawp, I don't know
[28051]388  'GRAWP WANT HAGGER
[28052]360  'One of the giants massive hands reached down
[28053]2340    Hermione let out a real scream, ran a few steps backwards and fell over
[28054]7029    Devoid of a wand, Harry braced himself to punch, kick, bite or whatever else it took as the hand swooped towards him and knocked a snow-white centaur off his legs
[28055]12618   It was what the centaurs had been waiting for-Grawp's outstretched fingers were a foot from Harry when fifty arrows soared through the air at the giant, peppering his enormous face, causing him to howl with pain and rage and straighten up, rubbing his face with his enormous hands, breaking off the arrow shafts but forcing the arrowheads in still deeper
[28056]13720   He yelled and stamped his enormous feet and the centaur; scattered out of the way; pebble-sized droplets of Grawp's blood showered Harry as he pulled Hermione to her feet and the pair of them ran as fast as they could for the shelter of the trees
[28057]1908    Once there they looked back; Grawp was snatching blindly at the centaurs as blood ran down his face; they were retreating in disorder, galloping away through the trees on the other side of the clearing
[28058]7835    Harry and Hermione watched Grawp give another roar of fury and plunge after them, smashing more trees aside as he went
[28059]7724   Oh no,' said Hermione, quaking so badly that her knees gave way
[28060]416    Oh, that was horrible
[28061]84    And he might kill them all
[28062]11288   'I'm not that fussed, to be honest,' said Harry bitterly
[28063]181   The sounds of the galloping centaurs and the blundering giant grew fainter and fainter
[28064]6413    As Harry listened to them, his scar gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him
[28065]1233   They had wasted so much time-they were even further from rescuing Sirius than they had been when he had had the vision
[28066]6507    Not only had Harry managed to lose his wand but they were stuck in the middle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transport whatsoever
[28067]1792   Smart plan,' he spat at Hermione, having to release some of his fury
[28068]321    Really smart plan
[28069]0    Where do we go from here
[28070]7014  'We need to get back up to the castle,' said Hermione faintly
[28071]2621   By the time we've done that, Sirius'll probably be dead
[28072]10932  ' said Harry, kicking a nearby tree in temper
[28073]1458    A high-pitched chattering started up overhead and he looked up to see an angry Bowtruckle flexing its long twiglike fingers at him
[28074]9072   Well, we can't do anything without wands,' said Hermione hopelessly, dragging herself up again
[28075]6235    Anyway, Harry, how exactly were you planning to get all the way to London
[28076]1123  'Yeah, we were just wondering that
[28077]5644   ' said a familiar voice from behind her
[28078]7520   Harry and Hermione moved together instinctively and peered through the trees
[28079]3288   Ron came into sight, closely followed by Ginny, Neville and Luna
[28080]20117    All of them looked a little the worse for wear-there were several long scratches running the length of Ginny's cheek; a large purple lump was swelling above Neville's right eye; Ron's lip was bleeding worse than ever-but all were looking rather pleased with themselves
[28081]18273   So,' said Ron, pushing aside a low-hanging branch and holding out Harry's wand, had any ideas
[28082]1011  'How did you get away
[28083]8633  ' asked Harry in amazement, taking his wand from Ron
[28084]15009   Couple of Stunners, a Disarming Charm, Neville brought off a really nice little Impediment Jinx,' said Ron airily, now handing back Hermione's wand, too
[28085]2569    But Ginny was best, she got Malfoy-Bat Bogey Hex-it was superb, his whole face was covered in the great flapping things
[28086]749    Anyway, we saw you out of the window heading into the Forest and followed
[28087]1264    What've you done with Umbridge
[28088]11874  ' She got carried away,' said Harry
[28089]48    By a herd of centaurs
[28090]275   'And they left you behind
[28091]1301  ' asked Ginny, looking astonished
[28092]11560   No, they got chased off by Grawp,' said Harry
[28093]4797   Who's Grawp
[28094]502  ' Luna asked interestedly
[28095]12815   Hagrid's little brother,' said Ron promptly
[28096]151    Anyway, never mind that now
[28097]6399    Harry, what did you find out in the fire
[28098]2108   Has You-Know-Who got Sirius or-
[28099]15746  ' Yes,' said Harry, as his scar gave another painful prickle, and I'm sure Sirius is still alive, but I can't see how we're going to get there to help him
[28100]898   'They all fell silent, looking rather scared; the problem facing them seemed insurmountable
[28101]3051   Well, we'll have to fly, won't we
[28102]12234  ' said Luna, in the closest thing to a matter-of-fact voice Harry had ever heard her use
[28103]10931   OK,' said Harry irritably, rounding on her
[28104]13377    First of all, we aren't doing anything if you're including yourself in that, and second of all, Ron's me only one with a broomstick that isn't being guarded by a security troll, so-'I've got a broom
[28105]5422  ' said Ginny
[28106]7554   Yeah, but you're not coming,' said Ron angrily
[28107]755   Excuse me, but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do
[28108]6480  ' said Ginny, her jaw set so that her resemblance to Fred and George was suddenly striking
[28109]34268   You're too-' Harry began, but Ginny said fiercely, I'm three years older than you were when you fought You-Know-Who over the Philosophers Stone, and it's because of me that Malfoy's stuck back in Umbridge's office with giant flying bogies attacking him-'Yeah, but-'We were all in the DA together,' said Neville quietly
[28110]3334    It was all supposed to be about fighting You-Know-Who, wasn't it
[28111]1629   And this is the first chance we've had to do something real-or was that all just a game or something
[28112]13529  ' No-of course it wasn't-' said Harry impatiently
[28113]5872   Then we should come too,' said Neville simply
[28114]480    We want to help
[28115]10643   'That's right,' said Luna, smiling happily
[28116]17778   Harry's eyes met Ron's
[28117]7714    He knew Ron was thinking exactly what he was: if he could have chosen any members of the DA, in addition to himself, Ron and Hermione, to join him in the attempt to rescue Sirius, he would not have picked Ginny, Neville or Luna
[28118]23359   Well, it doesn't matter, anyway,' said Harry through gritted teeth, because we still don't know how to get there-'I thought we'd settled that,' said Luna maddeningly
[28119]71    We're flying
[28120]15676  'Look,' said Ron, barely containing his anger, you might be able to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us can't sprout wings whenever we-'There are ways of flying other than with broomsticks,' said Luna serenely
[28121]5259   I s'pose we're going to ride on the back of the Kacky Snorgle or whatever it is
[28122]2031  ' Ron demanded
[28123]9856   The Crumple-Horned Snorkack can't fly,' said Luna in a dignified voice, but they can, and Hagrid says they're very good at finding places their riders are looking for
[28124]5866   'Harry whirled round
[28125]1242    Standing between two trees, their white eyes gleaming eerily, were two Thestrals, watching the whispered conversation as though they understood every word
[28126]292   Yes
[28127]219  ' he whispered, moving towards them
[28128]12186    They tossed their reptilian heads, throwing back long black manes, and Harry stretched out his hand eagerly and patted the nearest one's shining neck; how could he ever have thought them ugly
[28129]247   Is it those mad horse things
[28130]13570  ' said Ron uncertainly, staring at a point slightly to the left of the Thestral Harry was patting
[28131]3158    Those ones you can't see unless you've watched someone snuff it
[28132]11095  'Yeah,' said Harry
[28133]0   How many
[28134]808  'Just two
[28135]8625   'Well, we need three,' said Hermione, who was still looking a little shaken, but determined just the same
[28136]7044   Four, Hermione,' said Ginny, scowling
[28137]5886   I think there are six of us, actually,' said Luna calmly, counting
[28138]5320   Don't be stupid, we can't all go
[28139]10901  ' said Harry angrily
[28140]1407    Look, you three-' he pointed at Neville, Ginny and Luna, you're not involved in this, you're not-'They burst into more protests
[28141]340    His scar gave another, more painful, twinge
[28142]1501    Every moment they delayed was precious; he did not have time to argue
[28143]20699   OK, fine, it's your choice,' he said curtly, but unless we can find more Thestrals you're not going to be able-'Oh, more of them will come,' said Ginny confidently, who like Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the impression that she was looking at the horses
[28144]589   What makes you think that
[28145]10899  'Because, in case you hadn't noticed, you and Hermione are both covered in blood,' she said coolly, and we know Hagrid lures Thestrals with raw meat
[28146]5332    That's probably why these two turned up in the first place
[28147]12096   'Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest Thestral licking his sleeve, which was damp with Grawp's blood
[28148]10128   OK, then,' he said, a bright idea occurring, Ron and I will take these two and go ahead, and Hermione can stay here with you three and she'll attract more Thestrals-'I'm not staying behind
[28149]6750  ' said Hermione furiously
[28150]10229   There's no need,' said Luna, smiling
[28151]893    Look, here come more now 
[28152]0   
[28153]0   
[28154]314    you two must really smell 
[28155]0   
[28156]0   
[28157]7485   'Harry turned: no fewer than six or seven Thestrals were picking their way through the trees, their great leathery wings folded tight to their bodies, their eyes gleaming through the darkness
[28158]22    He had no excuse now
[28159]5747   All right,' he said angrily, pick one and get on, then

[28169]11131     Harry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest Thestral, placed a foot on a stump nearby and scrambled clumsily on to the horse's silken back
[28170]1424    It did not object, but twisted its head around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes
[28171]1261   He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure, then looked around at the others
[28172]5239    Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next Thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature's back
[28173]1435    Luna was already in place, sitting side-saddle and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day
[28174]4580    Ron, Hermione and Ginny, however, were still standing motionless on the spot, open-mouthed and staring
[28175]0   What
[28176]5086  ' he said
[28177]92   How're we supposed to get on
[28178]7105  ' said Ron faintly
[28179]2442    When we can't see the things
[28180]12362  'Oh, it's easy,' said Luna, sliding obligingly from her Thestral and marching over to him, Hermione and Ginny
[28181]436    Come here 
[28182]0   
[28183]0   
[28184]562   'She pulled them over to the other Thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help them on to the back of their mount
[28185]2032    All three looked extremely nervous as she wound their hands into their horses mane and told them to grip tightly before she got back on to her own steed
[28186]7457   This is mad,' Ron murmured, moving his free hand gingerly up and down his horse's neck
[28187]87    Mad 
[28188]0   
[28189]0   
[28190]12545    if I could just see it-'You'd better hope it stays invisible,' said Harry darkly
[28191]80    We all ready, then
[28192]669  'They all nodded and he saw live pairs of knees tighten beneath their robes
[28193]82   OK 
[28194]0   
[28195]0   
[28196]6196   'He looked down at the back of his Thestral's glossy black head and swallowed
[28197]5642   Ministry of Magic, visitors' entrance, London, then,' he said uncertainly
[28198]121    Er

[28206]0   
[28207]17951   'For a moment Harry's Thestral did nothing at all; then, with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him, the wings on either side extended; the horse crouched slowly, then rocketed upwards so fast and so steeply that Harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backwards over its bony rump
[28208]1541    He closed his eyes and pressed his face down into the horses silky mane as they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out into a blood-red sunset
[28209]20510   Harry did not think he had ever moved so fast: the Thestral streaked over the castle, its wide wings hardly beating; the cooling air was slapping Harry's face; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind, he looked round and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him, each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their Thestral to protect themselves from his slipstream
[28210]6180   They were over the Hogwarts grounds, they had passed Hogsmeade; Harry could see mountains and gullies below them
[28211]7095    As the daylight began to fail, Harry saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills 
[28212]0   
[28213]0   
[28214]5   This is bizarre
[28215]8335  ' Harry barely heard Ron yell from somewhere behind him, and he imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible means of support
[28216]1425   Twilight fell: the sky was turning to a light, dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars, and soon only the lights of Muggle towns gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were, or how very fast they were travelling
[28217]15466    Harry's arms were wrapped tightly around his horse's neck as he willed it to go even faster
[28218]1853    How much time had elapsed since he had seen Sirius lying on the Department of Mysteries floor
[28219]1072   How much longer would Sirius be able to resist Voldemort
[28220]12969   All Harry knew for sure was that his godfather had neither done as Voldemort wanted, nor died, for he was convinced that either outcome would have caused him to feel Voldemort's jubilation or fury course through his own body, making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Mr
[28221]694    Weasley was attacked
[28222]17184   On they flew through the gathering darkness; Harry's face felt stiff and cold, his legs numb from gripping the Thestral's sides so tightly, but he did not dare shift his position lest he slip 
[28223]0   
[28224]0   
[28225]811    he was deaf from the thundering rush of air in his ears, and his mouth was dry and frozen from the cold night wind
[28226]1056    He had lost all sense of how far they had come; all his faith was in the beast beneath him, still streaking purposefully through the night, barely flapping its wings as it sped ever onwards
[28227]44   If they were too late 
[28228]0   
[28229]0   
[28230]9691   He's still alive, he's still fighting, I can feel it

[28234]0

[28236]1392   I'd know 
[28237]0   
[28238]0   
[28239]16616   Harry's stomach gave a jolt; the Thestral's head was suddenly pointing towards the ground and he actually slid forwards a few inches along its neck
[28240]4    They were descending at last 
[28241]0   
[28242]0   
[28243]871    he thought he heard a shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously, but could see no sign of a falling body 
[28244]0   
[28245]0   
[28246]945    presumably they had all received a shock from the change of direction, just as he had
[28247]1530   And now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on all sides; they could see the tops of buildings, streams of headlights like luminous insect eyes, squares of pale yellow that were windows
[28248]13744    Quite suddenly, it seemed, they were hurtling towards the pavement; Harry gripped the Thestral with every last ounce of his strength, braced for a sudden impact, but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and Harry slid from its back, looking around at the street where the overflowing skip still stood a short way from the vandalised telephone box, both drained of colour in the flat orange glare of the streetlights
[28249]2536   Ron landed a short way off and toppled immediately from his Thestral on to the pavement
[28250]5357   Never again,' he said, struggling to his feet
[28251]552    He made as though to stride away from his Thestral, but, unable to see it, collided with its hindquarters and almost fell over again
[28252]0    Never, ever again 
[28253]0   
[28254]0   
[28255]5139    that was the worst-'Hermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him: both slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than Ron, though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground; Neville jumped down, shaking; and Luna dismounted smoothly
[28256]0   Where do we go from here, then
[28257]6857  ' she asked Harry in a politely interested voice, as though this was all a rather interesting day-trip
[28258]5086   Over here,' he said
[28259]1590    He gave his Thestral a quick, grateful pat, then led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the door
[28260]436    Come on
[28261]32  ' he urged the others, as they hesitated
[28262]10898   Ron and Ginny marched in obediently; Hermione, Neville and Luna squashed themselves in after them; Harry took one glance back at the Thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the skip, then forced himself into the box after Luna
[28263]4798   Whoever's nearest the receiver, dial six two four four two
[28264]5086  ' he said
[28265]3914   Ron did it, his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial; as it whirred back into place the cool female voice sounded inside the box
[28266]458   Welcome to the Ministry of Magic
[28267]55    Please state your name and business
[28268]22951   ' Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger,' Harry said very quickly, Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood 
[28269]0   
[28270]0   
[28271]298    we're here to save someone, unless your Ministry can do it first
[28272]5718  'Thank you,' said the cool female voice
[28273]180    Visitors, please take the badges and attach them to the front of your robes
[28274]446   'Half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned coins normally appeared
[28275]19235    Hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to Harry over Ginny's head; he glanced at the topmost one, Harry Potter,Rescue Mission
[28276]864   Visitors to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wands for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium
[28277]75   'Fine
[28278]11276  ' Harry said loudly, as his scar gave another throb
[28279]0    Now can we move
[28280]1601  'The floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past its glass windows; the scavenging Thestrals were sliding out of sight; blackness closed over their heads and with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Ministry of Magic
[28281]634   A chink of soft golden light hit their feet and, widening, rose up their bodies
[28282]6672    Harry bent his knees and held his wand as ready as he could in such cramped conditions as he peered through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium, but it seemed, to be completely empty
[28283]1597    The light was dimmer than it had been by day; there were no fires burning under the mantelpieces set into the walls, but as the lift slid smoothly to a halt he saw that golden symbols continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling
[28284]10965   The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening,' said the woman's voice
[28285]7233   The door of the telephone box burst open; Harry toppled out of it, closely followed by Neville and Luna
[28286]15610    The only sound in the Atrium was the steady rush of water from the golden fountain, where jets from the wands of the witch and wizard, the point of the centaur's arrow, the tip of the goblin's hat and the house-elf's ears continued to gush into the surrounding pool
[28287]28733   Come on, said Harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall, Harry in the lead, past the fountain towards the desk where the watchwizard who had weighed Harry's wand had sat, and which was now deserted
[28288]7079   Harry felt sure there ought to be a security person there, sure their absence was an ominous sign, and his feeling of foreboding increased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts
[28289]925    He pressed the nearest down' button and a lift clattered into sight almost immediately, the golden grilles slid apart with a great, echoing clanking and they dashed inside
[28290]6131    Harry stabbed the number nine button; the grilles closed with a bang and the lift began to descend, jangling and rattling
[28291]6765    Harry had not realised how noisy the lifts were on the day he had come with Mr
[28292]7089    Weasley; he was sure the din would raise every security person within the building, yet when the lilt halted, the cool female voice said, Department of Mysteries,' and the grilles slid open
[28293]554    They stepped out into the corridor where nothing was moving out but the nearest torches, flickering in the rush of air from the lift
[28294]6813   Harry turned towards the plain black door
[28295]106    After months and months of dreaming about it, he was here at last
[28296]7066   Let's go,' he whispered, and he led the way down the corridor, Luna right behind him, gazing around with her mouth slightly open
[28297]11737   OK, listen,' said Harry, stopping again within six feet of the door
[28298]73    Maybe 
[28299]0   
[28300]0   
[28301]6954    maybe a couple of people should stay here as a-as a lookout, and-' And how're we going to let you know something's coming
[28302]859  ' asked Ginny, her eyebrows raised
[28303]360    You could be miles away
[28304]11230   'We're coming with you, Harry,' said Neville
[28305]12203   Let's get on with it,' said Ron firmly
[28306]6757   Harry still did not want to take them all with him, but it seemed he had no choice
[28307]1573    He turned to face the door and walked forwards 
[28308]0   
[28309]0   
[28310]1197    just as it had in his dream, it swung open and he marched over the threshold, the others at his heels
[28311]834   They were standing in a large, circular room
[28312]2879    Everything in here was black including the floor and ceiling; identical, unmarked, handleless black doors were set at intervals all around the black walls, interspersed with branches of candles whose flames burned blue; their cool, shimmering light reflected in the shining marble floor made it look as though there was dark water underfoot
[28313]6442   Someone shut the door,' Harry muttered
[28314]799   He regretted giving this order the moment Neville had obeyed it
[28315]1960    Without the long chink of light from the torchlit corridor behind them, the place became so dark that for a moment the only things they could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and their ghostly reflections in the floor
[28316]7214   In his dream, Harry had always walked purposefully across this room to the door immediately opposite the entrance and walked on
[28317]123    But there were around a dozen doors here
[28318]2413    Just as he was gazing ahead at the doors opposite him, trying to decide which was the right one, there was a great rumbling noise and the candles began to move sideways
[28319]164    The circular wall was rotating
[28320]13201   Hermione grabbed Harry's arm as though frightened the floor might move, too, but it did not
[28321]903    For a few seconds, the blue flames around them were blurred to resemble neon lines as the wall sped around; then, quite as suddenly as it had started, the rumbling stopped and everything became stationary once again
[28322]11039   Harry's eyes had blue streaks burned into them; it was all he could see
[28323]0   What was that about
[28324]2132  ' whispered Ron fearfully
[28325]7418   I think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in through,' said Ginny in a hushed voice
[28326]7981   Harry realised at once she was right: he could no sooner identify the exit door than locate an ant on the jet-black floor; and the door through which they needed to proceed could be any one of the dozen surrounding them
[28327]489   How're we going to get back out
[28328]5403  ' said Neville uncomfortably
[28329]20931   Well, that doesn't matter now,' said Harry forcefully, blinking to try to erase the blue lines from his vision, and clutching his wand tighter than ever, we won't need to get out till we've found Sirius-'Don't go calling for him, though
[28330]12582  ' Hermione said urgently; but Harry had never needed her advice less, his instinct was to keep as quiet as possible
[28331]5732   Where do we go, then, Harry
[28332]2358  ' Ron asked
[28333]8794   I don't-' Harry began
[28334]22    He swallowed
[28335]7809    In the dreams I went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark room-that's this one-and then I went through another door into a room that kind of 
[28336]0   
[28337]0   
[28338]1    glitters
[28339]7562    We should try a few doors,' he said hastily, I'll know the right way when I see it
[28340]59    C'mon
[28341]2752   'He marched straight at the door now facing him, the others following close behind him, set his left hand against its cool, shining surface, raised his wand ready to strike the moment it opened, and pushed
[28342]303   It swung open easily
[28343]7830   After the darkness of the first room, the lamps hanging low on golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rectangular room was much brighter, though there were no glittering, shimmering lights as Harry had seen in his dreams
[28344]1482    The place was quite empty except for a few desks and, in the very middle of the room, an enormous glass tank of deep green liquid, big enough for all of them to swim in; a number of pearly-white objects were drifting around lazily in it
[28345]134   What're those things
[28346]2125  ' whispered Ron
[28347]10862   Dunno,' said Harry
[28348]6   Are they fish
[28349]358  ' breathed Ginny
[28350]2   Aquavirius Maggots
[28351]5257  ' said Luna excitedly
[28352]12120    Dad said the Ministry were breeding-'No,' said Hermione
[28353]112    She sounded odd
[28354]604    She moved forward to look through the side of the tank
[28355]19    They're brains
[28356]19   'Brains
[28357]292  'Yes 
[28358]0   
[28359]0   
[28360]212    I wonder what they're doing with them
[28361]5776  'Harry joined her at the tank
[28362]681    Sure enough, there could be no mistake now he saw them at close quarters
[28363]1568    Glimmering eerily, they drifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green liquid, looking something like slimy cauliflowers
[28364]15888   Let's get out of here,' said Harry
[28365]3733    This isn't right, we need to try another door
[28366]7352   'There are doors here, too,' said Ron, pointing around the walls
[28367]10861    Harry's heart sank; how big was this place
[28368]6256  In my dream I went through that dark room into the second one,' he said
[28369]648    I think we should go back and try from there
[28370]12021   'So they hurried back into the dark, circular room; the ghostly shapes of the brains were now swimming before Harry's eyes instead of the blue candle flames
[28371]77   Wait
[28372]7990  ' said Hermione sharply, as Luna made to close the door of the brain room behind them
[28373]1    Flagrate
[28374]1067  'She drew with her wand in midair and a fiery X' appeared on the door
[28375]2430    No sooner had the door clicked shut behind them than there was a great rumbling, and once again the wall began to revolve very fast, but now there was a great red-gold blur in amongst the faint blue and, when all became still again, the fiery cross still burned, showing the door they had already tried
[28376]11249   Good thinking,' said Harry
[28377]6675    OK, let's try this one-'Again, he strode directly at the door facing him and pushed it open, his wand still raised, the others at his heels
[28378]1249   This room was larger than the last, dimly lit and rectangular, and the centre of it was sunken, forming a great stone pit some twenty feet deep
[28379]7491    They were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep steps like an amphitheatre, or the courtroom in which Harry had been tried by the Wizengamot
[28380]7545    Instead, of a chained chair, however, there was a raised stone dais in the centre of the pit, on which stood a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing was still standing
[28381]1807    Unsupported by any surrounding wall, the archway was hung with a tattered black curtain or veil which, despite the complete stillness of the cold surrounding air, was fluttering very slightly as though it had just been touched
[28382]4750   Who's there
[28383]10862  ' said Harry, jumping down on to the bench below
[28384]661    There was no answering voice, but the veil continued to flutter and sway
[28385]30   Careful
[28386]1738  ' whispered Hermione
[28387]6022   Harry scrambled down the benches one by one until he reached the stone bottom of the sunken pit
[28388]507    His footsteps echoed loudly as he walked slowly towards the dais
[28389]2168    The pointed archway looked much taller from where he now stood than it had when he'd been looking down on it from above
[28390]1038    Still the veil swayed gently, as though somebody had just passed through it
[28391]647   Sirius
[28392]5972  ' Harry spoke again, but more quietly now that he was nearer
[28393]918   He had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right behind the veil on the other side of the archway
[28394]939    Gripping his wand very tightly, he edged around the dais, but there was nobody there; all that could be seen was the other side of the tattered black veil
[28395]7037   Let's go,' called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps
[28396]14204    This isn't right, Harry, come on, let's go
[28397]7007   'She sounded scared, much more scared than she had in the room where the brains swam, yet Harry thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it, old though it was
[28398]429    The gently rippling veil intrigued him; he felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it
[28399]10884   Harry, let's go, OK
[28400]6715  ' Said Hermione more forcefully
[28401]5835   OK,' he said, but did not move
[28402]1079    He had just heard something
[28403]195    There were faint whispering, murmuring noises coming from the other side of the veil
[28404]104   What are you saying
[28405]5482  ' he said, very loudly, so that his words echoed all around the stone benches
[28406]10626   Nobody's talking, Harry
[28407]6797  ' said Hermione, now moving over to him
[28408]10028   Someone's whispering behind there,' he said, moving out of her reach and continuing to frown at the veil
[28409]2002    Is that you, Ron
[28410]7574  'I'm here, mate,' said Ron, appearing around the side of the archway
[28411]2497   Can't anyone else hear it
[28412]6211  ' Harry demanded, for the whispering and murmuring was becoming louder; without really meaning to put it there, he found his foot was on the dais
[28413]471   I can hear them too,' breathed Luna, joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil
[28414]312    There are people in there
[28415]231  ' What do you mean, in there
[28416]14957  ' demanded Hermione, jumping down from the bottom step and sounding much angrier than the occasion warranted, there isn't any in there", it's just an archway, there's no room for anybody to be there
[28417]6962    Harry, stop it, come away-'She grabbed his arm and pulled, but he resisted
[28418]6471   Harry, we are supposed to be here for Sirius
[28419]5766  ' she said in a high-pitched, strained voice
[28420]6525   Sirius,' Harry repeated, still gazing, mesmerised, at the continuously swaying veil
[28421]277    Yeah 
[28422]0   
[28423]0   
[28424]1237   'Something finally slid back into place in his brain; Sirius, captured, bound and tortured, and he was staring at this archway 
[28425]0   
[28426]0   
[28427]752   He took several paces back from the dais and wrenched his eyes from the veil
[28428]10156   Let's go,' he said
[28429]6112   That's what I've been trying to-well, come on, then
[28430]7120  ' said Hermione, and she led the way back around the dais
[28431]900    On the other side, Ginny and Neville were staring, apparently entranced, at the veil too
[28432]15271    Without speaking, Hermione took hold of Ginny's arm,Ron grabbed Neville's, and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the way back up to the door
[28433]675   What d'you reckon that arch was
[28434]8486  ' Harry asked Hermione as they regained the dark circular room
[28435]9416   I don't know, but whatever it was, it was dangerous,' she said firmly, again inscribing a fiery cross on the door
[28436]144   Once more, the wall span and became still again
[28437]6306    Harry approached another door at random and pushed
[28438]667    It did not move
[28439]4828   What's wrong
[28440]6701  ' said Hermione
[28441]4750   It's 
[28442]0   
[28443]0   
[28444]26    locked 
[28445]0   
[28446]0   
[28447]14088   ' said Harry, throwing his weight at the door, but it didn't budge
[28448]2409   This is it, then, isn't it
[28449]13672  ' said Ron excitedly, joining Harry in the attempt to force the door open
[28450]34    Bound to be
[28451]355  'Get out of the way
[28452]6756  ' said Hermione sharply
[28453]6292    She pointed her wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door and said, Alohomora
[28454]143  'Nothing happened
[28455]5417   Sirius's knife
[28456]10818  ' said Harry
[28457]1248    He pulled it out from inside his robes and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall
[28458]855    The others all watched eagerly as he ran it from top to bottom, withdrew it and then flung his shoulder again at the door
[28459]188    It remained as firmly shut as ever
[28460]6762    What was more, when Harry looked down at the knife, he saw the blade had melted
[28461]7772   Right, we're leaving that room,' said Hermione decisively
[28462]4750   But what if that's the one
[28463]7283  ' said Ron, staring at it with a mixture of apprehension and longing
[28464]26670   It can't be, Harry could get through all the doors in his dream,' said Hermione, marking the door with another fiery cross as Harry replaced the now-useless handle of Sirius's knife in his pocket
[28465]771   You know what could be in there
[28466]5538  ' said Luna eagerly, as the wall started to spin yet again
[28467]7726   Something blibbering, no doubt,' said Hermione under her breath and Neville gave a nervous little laugh
[28468]6915   The wall slid to a halt and Harry, with a feeling of increasing desperation, pushed the next door open
[28469]0   This is it
[28470]454  'He knew it at once by the beautiful, dancing, diamond-sparkling light
[28471]13496    As Harry's eyes became accustomed to the brilliant glare, he saw clocks gleaming from every surface, large and small, grandfather and carriage, hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging the length of the room, so that a busy, relentless ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule, marching footsteps
[28472]1289    The source of the dancing, diamond-bright light was a towering crystal bell jar that stood at the far end of the room
[28473]355   This way
[28474]12906  'Harry's heart was pumping frantically now that he knew they were on the right track; he led the way down the narrow space between the lines of desks, heading, as he had done in his dream, for the source of the light, the crystal bell jar quite as tall as he was that stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing, glittering wind
[28475]574   Oh, took
[28476]5762  ' said Ginny, as they drew nearer, pointing at the very heart of the bell jar
[28477]355   Drifting along in the sparkling current inside was a tiny, jewel-bright egg
[28478]1190    As it rose in the jar, it cracked open and a hummingbird emerged, which was carried to the very top of the jar, but as it fell on the draught its feathers became bedraggled and damp again, and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg
[28479]489   Keep going
[28480]16316  ' said Harry sharply, because Ginny showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the egg's progress back into a bird
[28481]195   You dawdled enough by that old arch
[28482]5940  ' she said crossly, but followed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it
[28483]17141   This is it,' Harry said again, and his heart was now pumping so hard and fast he felt it must interfere with his speech, it's through here-'He glanced around at them all; they had their wands out and looked suddenly serious and anxious
[28484]1221    He looked back at the door and pushed
[28485]284    It swung open
[28486]682   They were there, they had found the place: high as a church and full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small, dusty glass orbs
[28487]352    They glimmered dully in the light issuing from more candle-brackets set at intervals along the shelves
[28488]1319    Like those in the circular room behind them, their flames were burning blue
[28489]549    The room was very cold
[28490]5876   Harry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles between two rows of shelves
[28491]298    He could not hear anything or see the slightest sign of movement
[28492]6924   You said it was row ninety-seven,' whispered Hermione
[28493]6907   Yeah,' breathed Harry, looking up at the end of the closest row
[28494]315    Beneath the branch of blue-glowing candles protruding from it glimmered the silver figure fifty-three
[28495]3098   We need to go right, I think,' whispered Hermione, squinting to the next row
[28496]292    Yes 
[28497]0   
[28498]0   
[28499]4790    that's fifty-four 
[28500]0   
[28501]0   
[28502]10988   'Keep your wands ready,' Harry said softly
[28503]791   They crept forward, glancing behind them as they went on down the long alleys of shelves, the further ends of which were in near-total darkness
[28504]282    Tiny, yellowing labels had been stuck beneath each glass orb on the shelves
[28505]526    Some of them had a weird, liquid glow; others were as dull and dark within as blown light bulbs
[28506]163   They passed row eighty-four 
[28507]0   
[28508]0   
[28509]4    eighty-five 
[28510]0   
[28511]0   
[28512]6769    Harry was listening hard for the slightest sound of movement, but Sirius might be gagged now, or else unconscious 
[28513]0   
[28514]0   
[28515]6406    or, said an unbidden voice inside his head, he might already be dead 
[28516]0   
[28517]0   
[28518]7481    I'd have felt it, he told himself, his heart now hammering against his Adam's apple, I'd already know 
[28519]0   
[28520]0   
[28521]56   Ninety-seven
[28522]1738  ' whispered Hermione
[28523]512   They stood grouped around the end of the row, gazing down the alley beside it
[28524]0    There was nobody there
[28525]16709   He's right down at the end,' said Harry, whose mouth had become slightly dry
[28526]2332    You can't see properly from here
[28527]360   'And he led them between the towering rows of glass balls, some of which glowed softly as they passed 
[28528]0   
[28529]0   
[28530]7484   He should be near here,' whispered Harry, convinced that every step was going to bring the ragged form of Sirius into view on the darkened floor
[28531]0    Anywhere here 
[28532]0   
[28533]0   
[28534]386    really close 
[28535]0   
[28536]0   
[28537]5732   'Harry
[28538]7721  ' said Hermione tentatively, but he did not want to respond
[28539]201    His mouth was very dry
[28540]0   Somewhere about 
[28541]0   
[28542]0   
[28543]0    here 
[28544]0   
[28545]0

[28547]454   They had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim candlelight, There was nobody there
[28548]132    All was echoing, dusty silence
[28549]0   He might be 
[28550]0   
[28551]0   
[28552]5920   ' Harry whispered hoarsely, peering down the next alley
[28553]73    Or maybe 
[28554]0   
[28555]0   
[28556]532   ' He hurried to look down the one beyond that
[28557]5732   Harry
[28558]6701  ' said Hermione again
[28559]0   What
[28560]37  ' he snarled
[28561]0   I 
[28562]0   
[28563]0   
[28564]4150    I don't think Sirius is here
[28565]65   'Nobody spoke
[28566]7191    Harry did not want to look at any of them
[28567]316    He felt sick
[28568]1402    He did not understand why Sirius was not here
[28569]0    He had to be here
[28570]5915    This was where he, Harry, had seen him 
[28571]0   
[28572]0   
[28573]490   He ran up the space at the end of the rows, staring down them
[28574]170    Empty aisle after empty aisle flickered past
[28575]750    He ran the other way, back past his staring companions
[28576]734    There was no sign of Sirius anywhere, nor any hint of a struggle
[28577]5732   Harry
[28578]2121  ' Ron called
[28579]0   What
[28580]9398  'He did not want to hear what Ron had to say; did not want to hear Ron tell him he had been stupid or suggest that they ought to go back to Hogwarts, but the heat was rising in his face and he felt as though he would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while before facing the brightness of the Atrium above and the others' accusing stares 
[28581]0   
[28582]0   
[28583]183   Have you seen this
[28584]7088  ' said Ron
[28585]0   What
[28586]12158  ' said Harry, but eagerly this time-it had to be a sign that Sirius had been there, a clue
[28587]3261    He strode back to where they were all standing, a little way down row ninety-seven, but found nothing except Ron staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelf
[28588]0   What
[28589]5794  ' Harry repeated glumly
[28590]17278   It's-it's got your name on,' said Ron
[28591]6140   Harry moved a little closer
[28592]2840    Ron was pointing at one of the small glass spheres that glowed with a dull inner light, though it was very dusty and appeared not to have been touched for many years
[28593]0   My name
[28594]10840  ' said Harry blankly
[28595]128   He stepped forwards
[28596]2990    Not as tall as Ron, he had to crane his neck to read the yellowish label affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty glass ball
[28597]5051    In spidery writing was written a date of some sixteen years previously, and below that:S

[28609]4932    What's your name doing down here
[28610]87  'He glanced along at the other labels on that stretch of shelf
[28611]5575   I'm not here,' he said, sounding perplexed
[28612]108    None of the rest of us are here
[28613]16412   'Harry, I don't think you should touch it,' said Hermione sharply, as he stretched out his hand
[28614]0   Why not
[28615]5086  ' he said
[28616]7159    It's something to do with me, isn't it
[28617]14168  'Don't, Harry,' said Neville suddenly
[28618]6408    Harry looked at him
[28619]5910    Neville's round face was shining slightly with sweat
[28620]677    He looked as though he could not take much more suspense
[28621]16258   It's got my name on,' said Harry
[28622]5330   And feeling slightly reckless, he closed his fingers around the dusty ball's surface
[28623]937    He had expected it to feel cold, but it did not
[28624]607    On the contrary, it felt as though it had been lying in the sun for hours, as though the glow of light within was warming it
[28625]7264    Expecting, even hoping, that something dramatic was going to happen, something exciting that might make their long and dangerous journey worth while after all, Harry lifted the glass ball down from its shelf and stared at it
[28626]151   Nothing whatsoever happened
[28627]5997    The others moved in closer around Harry, gazing at the orb as he brushed it free of the clogging dust
[28628]1164   And then, from right behind them, a drawling voice spoke
[28629]804   Very good, Potter
[28630]252    Now turn around, nice and slowly, and give that to me

[28639]3324     Black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them, blocking their way left and right; eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts; Ginny gave a gasp of horror
[28640]1971   To me, Potter,' repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he held out his hand, palm up
[28641]10506   Harry's insides plummeted sickeningly
[28642]17    They were trapped, and outnumbered two to one
[28643]5526   To me,' said Malfoy yet again
[28644]5397   Where's Sirius
[28645]10818  ' Harry said
[28646]17213   Several of the Death Eaters laughed; a harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to Harry's left said triumphantly, The Dark Lord always knows
[28647]512  'Always,' echoed Malfoy softly
[28648]523    Now, give me the prophecy, Potter
[28649]1753   'I want to know where Sirius is
[28650]1753  'I want to know where Sirius is
[28651]338  ' mimicked the woman to his left
[28652]17859   She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from Harry and the others, the light from their wands dazzling Harry's eyes
[28653]12519   You've got him,' said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest, the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row
[28654]4750    He's here
[28655]771    I know he is
[28656]6099   'The little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was twoo,' said the woman in a horrible, mock baby voice
[28657]8020    Harry felt Ron stir beside him

[28659]469    Not yet-'The woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of laughter
[28660]189   You hear him
[28661]189   You hear him
[28662]178  Giving instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us
[28663]10160  'Oh, you don't know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,' said Malfoy softly
[28664]662    He has a great weakness for heroics; the Dark Lord understands this about him
[28665]523    Now give me the prophecy, Potter
[28666]12650   'I know Sirius is here,' said Harry, though panic was causing his chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly
[28667]2154    I know you've got him
[28668]420  'More of the Death Eaters laughed, though the woman laughed loudest of all
[28669]11441   It's time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,' said Malfoy
[28670]210    Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands
[28671]11332   'Go on, then,' said Harry, raising his own wand to chest height
[28672]5158    As he did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny and Luna rose on either side of him
[28673]10557    The knot in Harry's stomach tightened
[28674]1092    If Sirius really was not here, he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all 
[28675]0   
[28676]0   
[28677]932   But the Death Eaters did not strike
[28678]6214   Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,' said Malfoy coolly
[28679]10605   It was Harry's turn to laugh
[28680]834   Yeah, right
[28681]5086  ' he said
[28682]62    I give you this-prophecy, is it
[28683]1781   And you'll just let us skip off home, will you
[28684]7779  'The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked: Accio proph -'Harry was just ready for her: he shouted Protego' before she had finished her spell, and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it
[28685]7069   Oh, he knows how to play, little bitty baby Potter,' she said, her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood
[28686]322    Very well, then-'I TOLD YOU, NO
[28687]602  ' Lucius Malfoy roared at the woman
[28688]5    If you smash it-
[28689]10643  ' Harry's mind was racing
[28690]558    The Death Eaters wanted this dusty spun-glass sphere
[28691]0    He had no interest in it
[28692]1570    He just wanted to get them all out of this alive, to make sure none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity 
[28693]0   
[28694]0   
[28695]710   The woman stepped forward, away from her fellows, and pulled off her hood
[28696]6309    Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange's face, making it gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow
[28697]184   You need more persuasion
[28698]5222  ' she said, her chest rising and falling rapidly
[28699]265    Very well-take the smallest one,' she ordered the Death Eaters beside her
[28700]756    Let him watch while we torture the little girl
[28701]567    I'll do it
[28702]7296   'Harry felt the others close in around Ginny; he stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her, the prophecy held up to his chest
[28703]1347   You'll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us,' he told Bellatrix
[28704]4004    I don't think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it, will he
[28705]1066  'She did not move; she merely stared at him, the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth
[28706]11111   So,' said Harry, what kind of prophecy are we talking about, anyway
[28707]706  'He could not think what to do but to keep talking
[28708]6114    Neville's arm was pressed against his, and he could feel him shaking; he could feel one of the others' quickened breath on the back of his head
[28709]479    He was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this, because his mind was blank
[28710]149   What kind of prophecy
[28711]655  ' repeated Bellatrix, the grin fading from her face
[28712]6194    You jest, Harry Potter
[28713]12402   'Nope, not jesting,' said Harry, his eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they could escape
[28714]707    How come Voldemort wants it
[28715]660  Several of the Death Eaters let out low hisses
[28716]99   You dare speak his name
[28717]176  ' whispered Bellatrix
[28718]11346   Yeah,' said Harry, maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him
[28719]2086    Yeah, I've got no problem with saying Vol-Shut your mouth
[28720]82  ' Bellatrix shrieked
[28721]11672    You dare speak his name with your unworthy lips, you dare besmirch it with your half-blood's tongue, you dare-' Did you know he's a half-blood too
[28722]10819  ' said Harry recklessly
[28723]2198    Hermione gave a little moan in his ear
[28724]233    Voldemort
[28725]5705   Yeah, his mother was a witch but his dad was a Muggle-or has he been telling you lot he's pure-blood
[28726]1  'STUPEF-'NO
[28727]12582  'A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange's wand, but Malfoy had deflected it; his spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered
[28728]6453   Two figures, pearly-white as ghosts, fluid as smoke, unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak; their voices vied with each other, so that only fragments of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrix's shouts

[28738]2493  'He dared-he dares-' shrieked Bellatrix incoherently, he stands there-filthy half-blood -'WAIT UN'I'LL WE'VE GOT THE PROPHECY

[28740]0   
[28741]0

[28743]436    and none will come after 
[28744]0   
[28745]0   
[28746]5217   ' said the figure of a young woman
[28747]272   The two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air
[28748]416    Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor
[28749]5921    They had, however, given Harry an idea
[28750]520    The problem was going to be conveying it to the others
[28751]13830   You haven't told me what's so special about this prophecy I'm supposed to be handing over,' he said, playing for time
[28752]5242    He moved his foot slowly sideways, feeling around for someone else's
[28753]6019   Do not play games with us, Potter,' said Malfoy
[28754]11918   I'm not playing games,' said Harry, half his mind on the conversation, half on his wandering foot
[28755]4781    And then he found someone's toes and pressed down upon them
[28756]6806    A sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were Hermione's
[28757]0   What
[28758]123  ' she whispered
[28759]1442   Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries
[28760]453  ' Malfoy sneered
[28761]0   I-what
[28762]10818  ' said Harry
[28763]501    And for a moment he quite forgot his plan
[28764]90    What about my scar
[28765]0  'What
[28766]1761  ' whispered Hermione more urgently behind him
[28767]0   Can this be
[28768]14969  ' said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of their laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, moving his lips as little as possible, Smash shelves-' Dumbledore never told you
[28769]493  ' Malfoy repeated
[28770]7814    Well, this explains why you didn't come earlier, Potter, the Dark Lord wondered why-'-when I say now- '-you didn't come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams
[28771]1131    He thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording 
[28772]0   
[28773]0   
[28774]667   'Did he
[28775]10818  ' said Harry
[28776]2632    Behind him he felt rather than heard Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking, to distract the Death Eaters
[28777]1276    So he wanted me to come and get it, did he
[28778]0   Why
[28779]0  'Why
[28780]527  ' Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted
[28781]1508    Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him
[28782]1073   'And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me
[28783]461  'About both of you, Potter, about both of you 
[28784]0   
[28785]0   
[28786]3112    haven't you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby
[28787]11753  'Harry stared into the slitted eye-holes through which Malfoy's grey eyes were gleaming
[28788]10876    Was this prophecy the reason Harry's parents had died, the reason he carried his lightning-bolt scar
[28789]443   Was the answer to all of this clutched in his hand
[28790]295  Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me
[28791]6326  ' he said quietly, gazing at Lucius Malfoy, his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand
[28792]130    It was hardly larger than a Snitch and still gritty with dust
[28793]5186    And he's made me come and get it for him
[28794]2873   Why couldn't he come and get it himself
[28795]0  'Get it himself
[28796]228  ' shrieked Bellatrix, over a cackle of mad laughter
[28797]972   The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so sweetly ignoring his return
[28798]1359   The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Aurors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin
[28799]5752  'So, he's got you doing his dirty work for him, has he
[28800]10818  ' said Harry
[28801]915    Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it-and Bode
[28802]1147  'Very good, Potter, very good 
[28803]0   
[28804]0   
[28805]5652   ' said Malfoy slowly
[28806]463    But the Dark Lord knows you are not unintell-NOW
[28807]5811  ' yelled Harry
[28808]123   Five different voices behind him bellowed, REDUCTO
[28809]2303  ' Five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit; the towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor-RUN
[28810]6105  ' Harry yelled, as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to fall from above
[28811]7480    He seized a handful of Hermione's robes and dragged her forwards, holding one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them
[28812]19887    A Death Eater lunged forwards through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face; they were all yelling, there were cries of pain, and thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres-Harry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron, Ginny and Luna sprint past him, their arms over their heads; something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onwards; a hand caught him by the shoulder; he heard Hermione shout, Stupefy
[28813]23576  ' The hand released him at once-They were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest; he could hear footsteps right behind him and Hermione's voice urging Neville on; straight ahead, the door through which they had come was ajar; Harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar; he pelted through the doorway, the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand, and waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them-Colloportus
[28814]2296  ' gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise
[28815]0   Where-where are the others
[28816]5772  ' gasped Harry
[28817]3452   He had thought Ron, Luna and Ginny were ahead of them, that they would be waiting in this room, but there was nobody there
[28818]562   They must have gone the wrong way
[28819]2280  ' whispered Hermione, terror in her face
[28820]75   Listen
[28821]429  ' whispered Neville
[28822]9664   Footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed; Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius Malfoy roar, Leave Nott, leave him, I say- his injuries will be nothing to the Dark Lord compared to losing that prophecy
[28823]623    Jugson, come back here, we need to organise
[28824]7679   We'll split into pairs and search, and don't forget, be gentle with Potter until we've got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary-Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the left; Crabbe, Rabastan, go right-Jugson, Dolohov, the door straight ahead-Macnair and Avery, through here-Rookwood, over there- Mulciber, come with me
[28825]0  'What do we do
[28826]8303  ' Hermione asked Harry, trembling from head to foot
[28827]13985   Well, we don't stand here waiting for them to find us, for a start,' said Harry
[28828]5912    Let's get away from this door
[28829]1372   'They ran as quietly as they could, past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching, towards the exit into the circular hallway at the far end of the room
[28830]8486    They were almost there when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door Hermione had charmed shut
[28831]105   Stand aside
[28832]5636  ' said a rough voice
[28833]3    Alohomora
[28834]8496  'As the door flew open, Harry, Hermione and Neville dived under desks
[28835]829    They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters' robes drawing nearer, their feet moving rapidly
[28836]6694   They might've run straight through to the hall,' said the rough voice
[28837]5139   Check under the desks,' said another
[28838]7059   Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend; poking his wand out from under the desk, he shouted, STUPEFY
[28839]14369  'A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backwards into a grandfather clock and knocked it over; the second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry's spell and was pointing his own wand at Hermione, who was crawling out from under the desk to get a better aim
[28840]6340   Avada-'Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry
[28841]1266    Neville overturned a desk in his anxiety to help; and pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair, he cried:EXPELLIARMUS
[28842]22706  'Both Harry's and the Death Eater's wands flew out of their hands and soared back towards the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in front, Harry hot on his heels, and Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horrorstruck by what he had done
[28843]6087   Get out of the way, Harry
[28844]513  ' yelled Neville, clearly determined to repair the damage
[28845]6482   Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and shouted:STUPEFY
[28846]3879  'The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eaters shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hour-glasses; the cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying everywhere, sprang back up on to the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered-The Death Eater had snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar
[28847]8825    Harry ducked down behind another desk as the man turned; his mask had slipped so that he couldn't see
[28848]586    He ripped it off with his free hand and shouted: STUP-'STUPEFY
[28849]2557  ' screamed Hermione, who had just caught up with them
[28850]1886    The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his chest: he froze, his arm still raised, his wand fell to the floor with a flatter and he collapsed backwards towards the bell jar
[28851]8690    Harry expected to hear a clunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar on to the floor, but instead, his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it were nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest, sprawled on his back on the table, with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind
[28852]419   Accio wand
[28853]1655  ' cried Hermione
[28854]11781    Harry's wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him
[28855]5126   Thanks,' he said
[28856]6084    Right, let's get out of-'Look out
[28857]5410  ' said Neville, horrified
[28858]5706    He was staring at the Death Eater's head in the bell jar
[28859]5903   All three of them raised their wands again, but none of them struck: they were all gazing, open-mouthed, appalled, at what was happening to the man's head
[28860]766   It was shrinking very fast, growing balder and balder, the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull; his cheeks becoming smooth, his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz 
[28861]0   
[28862]0   
[28863]7085   A baby's head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again; but even as they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell to its previous proportions again; thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin 
[28864]0   
[28865]0   
[28866]12553   It's Time,' said Hermione in an awestruck voice
[28867]556    Time 
[28868]0   
[28869]0   
[28870]1252   'The Death Eater shook his ugly head again, trying to clear it, but before he could pull himself together it began to shrink back to babyhood once more 
[28871]0   
[28872]0   
[28873]536   There was a shout from a room nearby, then a crash and a scream
[28874]2002   RON
[28875]6368  ' Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them
[28876]336    GINNY
[28877]144   LUNA
[28878]5732  'Harry
[28879]1651  ' Hermione screamed
[28880]951   The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar
[28881]11396    His appearance was utterly bizarre, his tiny baby's head bawling loudly while his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions, narrowly missing Harry, who had ducked
[28882]8059    Harry raised his wand but to his amazement Hermione seized his arm
[28883]2393   You can't hurt a baby
[28884]7918  'There was no time to argue the point; Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy and knew, too late, that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position
[28885]436   Come on
[28886]7506  ' he said, and leaving the ugly baby-headed Death Eater staggering behind them they took off for the door that stood open at the other end of the room, leading back into the black hallway
[28887]9490   They had run halfway towards it when Harry saw through the open door two more Death Eaters running across the black room towards them; veering left, he burst instead into a small, dark, cluttered office and slammed the door behind them
[28888]3527   Collo-' began Hermione, but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open and the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside
[28889]91   With a cry of triumph, both yelled:IMPEDIMENTA
[28890]22502  'Harry, Hermione and Neville were all knocked backwards off their feet; Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view; Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books; the back of Harry's head slammed into the stone wall behind him, tiny lights burst in front of his eyes and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react
[28891]1383   WE'VE GOT HIM
[28892]6062  ' yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry
[28893]178    IN AN OFFICE OFF-'Silencio
[28894]7076  ' cried Hermione and the man's voice was extinguished
[28895]631    He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound came out
[28896]292    He was thrust aside by his fellow Death Eater
[28897]8   Petrificus Totalus
[28898]6771  ' shouted Harry, as the second Death Eater raised his wand
[28899]11735    His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forwards, face down on to the rug at Harry's feet, stiff as a board and unable to move
[28900]11716   Well done, Ha-'But the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand; a streak of what looked like purple flame passed right across Hermione's chest
[28901]658    She gave a tiny Oh
[28902]412  ' as though of surprise and crumpled on to the floor, where she lay motionless
[28903]1615   HERMIONE
[28904]6853  'Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly towards her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of him
[28905]12104    The Death Eater kicked out hard at Neville's head as he emerged-his foot broke Neville's wand in two and connected with his face
[28906]949    Neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching his mouth and nose
[28907]14435    Harry twisted around, his own wand held high, and saw that the Death Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at Harry, who recognised the long, pale, twisted face from the Daily Prophet:Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the Prewetts
[28908]29   Dolohov grinned
[28909]13028    With his free hand, he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in Harry's hand, to himself, then at Hermione
[28910]160    Though he could no longer speak, his meaning could not have been clearer
[28911]62    Give me the prophecy, or you get the same as her 
[28912]0   
[28913]0   
[28914]3883   Like you won't kill us all anyway, the moment I hand it over
[28915]10818  ' said Harry
[28916]8856   A whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly: he had one hand on Hermione's shoulder, which was still warm, yet did not dare look at her properly
[28917]16322    Don't let her be dead, don't let her be dead, it's my fault if she's dead 
[28918]0   
[28919]0   
[28920]13245   Whaddever you do, Harry,' said Neville fiercely from under the desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin, don'd gib it to him
[28921]2627  'Then there was a crash outside the door and Dolohov looked over his shoulder-the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him
[28922]5859    Harry seized his chance:PETRIFICUS TOTALUS
[28923]326  'The spell hit Dolohov before he could block it and he toppled forwards across his comrade, both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch
[28924]12903   Hermione,' Harry said at once, shaking her as the baby-headed Death Eater blundered out of sight again
[28925]1647    Hermione, wake up 
[28926]0   
[28927]0   
[28928]1   'Whaddid he do to her
[28929]5782  ' said Neville, crawling out from under the desk to kneel at her other side, blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose
[28930]44   I dunno 
[28931]0   
[28932]0   
[28933]6685   'Neville groped for Hermione's wrist
[28934]10734   Dat's a pulse, Harry, I'b sure id is
[28935]6567   'Such a powerful wave of relief swept through Harry that for a moment he felt light-headed
[28936]4793   She's alive
[28937]280  'Yeah, I dink so
[28938]7001   'There was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sound of more footsteps, but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby-headed Death Eater in the next room
[28939]7337   Neville, we're not far from the exit,' Harry whispered, we're right next to that circular room 
[28940]0   
[28941]0   
[28942]4929    if we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, I'll bet you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift 
[28943]0   
[28944]0   
[28945]0    then you could find someone 
[28946]0   
[28947]0   
[28948]24    raise the alarm 
[28949]0   
[28950]0   
[28951]490   'And whad are you going do do
[28952]11322  ' said Neville, mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at Harry
[28953]12201   I've got to find the others,' said Harry
[28954]5948   Well, I'b going do find dem wid you,' said Neville firmly
[28955]7622   But Hermione-'We'll dake her wid us,' said Neville firmly
[28956]24588    I'll carry her-you're bedder at fighding dem dan I ab-He stood up and seized one of Hermione's arms, glaring at Harry, who hesitated, then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermione's limp form over Neville's shoulders
[28957]24170   Wait,' said Harry, snatching up Hermione's wand from the floor and shoving it into Neville's hand, you'd better take this
[28958]1605   'Neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly towards the door
[28959]16476   My gran's going do kill be,' said Neville thickly, blood spattering from his nose as he spoke, dat was by dad's old wand
[28960]7443   'Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously
[28961]7171    The baby-headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks, bawling and confused, while the glass-fronted cabinet that Harry now suspected had contained Time-Turners continued to fall, shatter and repair itself on the wall behind them
[28962]5394   He's never going to notice us,' he whispered
[28963]59    C'mon 
[28964]0   
[28965]0   
[28966]98    keep close behind me 
[28967]0   
[28968]0   
[28969]1010   'They crept out of the office and back towards the door into the black hallway, which now seemed completely deserted
[28970]8988    They walked a few steps forwards, Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione's weight; the door of the Time Room swung shut behind them and the walls began to rotate once more
[28971]11952    The recent blow on the back of Harry's head seemed to have unsteadied him; he narrowed his eyes, swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again
[28972]12663    With a sinking heart, Harry saw that Hermione's fiery crosses had faded from the doors
[28973]977   So which way d'you reck-
[28974]2428  'But before they could make a decision as to which way to try, a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it
[28975]2002   Ron
[28976]5755  ' croaked Harry, dashing towards them
[28977]336    Ginny-are you all-
[28978]24112  'Harry,' said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forwards, seizing the front of Harry's robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes, there you are 
[28979]0   
[28980]0   
[28981]87    ha ha ha 
[28982]0   
[28983]0   
[28984]6242    you look funny, Harry 
[28985]0   
[28986]0   
[28987]5    you're all messed up 
[28988]0   
[28989]0   
[28990]7947   'Ron's face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth
[28991]17401    Next moment his knees had given way, but he still clutched the front of Harry's robes, so that Harry was pulled into a kind of bow
[28992]336   Ginny
[28993]10825  ' Harry said fearfully
[28994]143    What happened
[28995]1359  'But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her ankle
[28996]5945   I think her ankle's broken, I heard something crack,' whispered Luna, who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt
[28997]8853    Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets; it was a very odd place, some of the time we were just floating in the dark-'Harry, we saw Uranus up close
[28998]7110  ' said Ron, still giggling feebly
[28999]5732    Get it, Harry
[29000]7649   We saw Uranus-ha ha ha-'A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron's mouth and burst
[29001]5836   -anyway, one of them grabbed Ginny's foot, I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but 
[29002]0   
[29003]0   
[29004]1466   'Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very shallow way, her eyes still closed
[29005]2002   And what about Ron
[29006]23595  ' said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to giggle, still hanging off the front of Harry's robes
[29007]14224   I don't know what they hit him with,' said Luna sadly, but he's gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all
[29008]30218   'Harry,' said Ron, pulling Harry's ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly, you know who this girl is, Harry
[29009]4758   She's Loony 
[29010]0   
[29011]0   
[29012]33    Loony Lovegood

[29016]0   
[29017]0   
[29018]12246   'We've got to get out of here,' said Harry firmly
[29019]625    Luna, can you help Ginny
[29020]11321  'Yes,' said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping, then putting an arm around Ginny's waist and pulling her up
[29021]4758   It's only my ankle, I can do it myself
[29022]5988  ' said Ginny impatiently, but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support
[29023]18891    Harry pulled Ron's arm over his shoulder just as, so many months ago, he had pulled Dudley's
[29024]6133    He looked around: they had a one in twelve chance of getting the exit right first time-He heaved Ron towards a door; they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters sped in, led by Bellatrix Lestrange
[29025]0   There they are
[29026]29  ' she shrieked
[29027]13277   Stunning Spells shot across the room: Harry smashed his way through the door ahead, flung Ron unceremoniously from him and ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione: they were all over the threshold just in time to slam the door against Bellatrix
[29028]3   Colloportus
[29029]6647  ' shouted Harry, and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side
[29030]2503   It doesn't matter
[29031]10496  ' said a man's voice
[29032]1394    There are other ways in-WE'VE GOT THEM, THEY'RE HERE
[29033]6626  'Harry span around; they were back in the Brain Room and, sure enough, there were doors all around the walls
[29034]1009    He could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join the first
[29035]595   Luna-Neville- help me
[29036]7063  'The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they went; Harry crashed into a tbale and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door:Colloportus
[29037]7811  'There were footsteps running along behind the doors, every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one, so it creaked and shuddered; Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall-then, as Harry reached the very top of the room, he heard Luna cry:Collo-aaaaaaaaargh 
[29038]0   
[29039]0   
[29040]5426   'He turned in time to see her flying through the air; five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and on to the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled, as still as Hermione
[29041]461   Get Potter
[29042]1575  ' shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him; he dodged her and sprinted back up the room; he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy-Hey
[29043]13095  ' said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly towards Harry, giggling
[29044]14020    Hey, Harry, there are brains in here, ha ha ha, isn't that weird, Harry
[29045]4860  'Ron, get out of the way, get down-'But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank
[29046]6276   Honest, Harry, they're brains-look-Accio brain
[29047]42  'The scene seemed momentarily frozen
[29048]39438    Harry, Ginny and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish: for a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared towards Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unravelling like rolls of film-Ha ha ha, Harry, look at it-' said Ron, watching it disgorge its gaudy innards, Harry, come and touch it; bet it's weird-'RON, NO
[29049]10324  'Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would not be anything good
[29050]2408    He darted forwards but Ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands
[29051]8023   The moment they made contact with his skin, the tentacles began wrapping themselves around Ron's arms like ropes
[29052]27584   Harry, look what's happen-No-no-I don't like it-no, stop-stop-'But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron's chest now; he tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an octopus's body
[29053]1   Diffindo
[29054]8615  ' yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break
[29055]2152    Ron fell over, still thrashing against his bonds
[29056]6300   Harry, it'll suffocate him
[29057]6635  ' screamed Ginny, immobilised by her broken ankle on the floor- then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater's wands and hit her squarely in the face
[29058]146    She keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious
[29059]5   STUBEFY
[29060]7511  ' shouted Neville, wheeling around and waving Hermione's wand at the oncoming Death Eaters, STUBEFY, STUBEFY
[29061]143  'But nothing happened
[29062]739   One of the Death Eaters shot their own Stunning Spell at Neville; it missed him by inches
[29063]8083    Harry and Neville were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of whom sent off streams of silver light like arrows which missed but left craters in the wall behind them
[29064]9002    Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange raced right at him: holding the prophecy high above his head, he sprinted back up the room; all he could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from the others
[29065]4577   It seemed to have worked; they streaked after him, knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy, and he dashed through the only door still open, the one through which the Death Eaters themselves had come; inwardly praying that Neville would stay with Ron and find some way of releasing him
[29066]2411    He ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish-He was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body, he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais
[29067]7206    The whole room was ringing with the Death Eater's laughter: he looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending towards him, while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench towards him
[29068]8610    Harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him: the prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand, his wand clutched tightly in his right
[29069]1561    He backed away, looking around, trying to keep all the Death Eaters within his sight
[29070]525    The back of his legs hit something solid: he had reached the dais where the archway stood
[29071]75    He climbed backwards onto it
[29072]312   The Death Eaters all halted, gazing at him
[29073]197    Some were panting as hard as he was
[29074]11801    One was bleeding badly; Dolohov, freed of the Body-Bind Curse, was leering, his wand pointing straight at Harry's face
[29075]2748   Potter, your race is run,' drawled Lucius Malfoy, pulling off his mask, now hand me the prophecy like a good boy
[29076]1207   'Let-let the others go, and I'll give it to you
[29077]10851  ' said Harry desperately
[29078]303   A few of the Death Eaters laughed
[29079]6669   You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,' said Lucius Malfoy, his pale face flushed with pleasure
[29080]0    You see, there are ten of us and only one of you 
[29081]0   
[29082]0   
[29083]3214    or hasn't Dumbledore ever taught you how to count
[29084]4751  'He's dot alone
[29085]674  ' shouted a voice from above them
[29086]4755    He's still god be
[29087]18361  ' Harry's heart sank: Neville was scrambling down the stone benches towards them, Hermione's wand held fast in his trembling hand
[29088]2313   Neville-no- go back to Ron-'STUBEFY
[29089]1230  ' Neville shouted again, pointing his wand at each Death Eater in turn
[29090]5    STUBEFY
[29091]722   STUBE-'One of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind, pinioning his arms to his sides
[29092]344    He struggled and kicked; several of the Death Eaters laughed
[29093]7195   It's Longbottom, isn't it
[29094]507  ' sneered Lucius Malfoy
[29095]236    Well, your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause 
[29096]0   
[29097]0   
[29098]896    your death will not come as a great shock
[29099]36   'Longbottom
[29100]796  ' repeated Bellatrix, and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face
[29101]279    Why, I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents, boy
[29102]3   'I DOE YOU HAB
[29103]5681  ' roared Neville, and he fought so hard against his captor's encircling grip that the Death Eater shouted, Someone Stun him
[29104]5139  'No, no, no,' said Bellatrix
[29105]6845    She looked transported, alive with excitement as she glanced at Harry, then back at Neville
[29106]6257    No, let's see how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents 
[29107]0   
[29108]0   
[29109]598    unless Potter wants to give us the prophecy
[29110]1267   'DON'D GIB ID DO DEM
[29111]1018  ' roared Neville, who seemed beside himself, kicking and writhing as Bellatrix drew nearer to him and his captor, her wand raised
[29112]6999    DON'D GIB ID DO DEM, HARRY
[29113]584  'Bellatrix raised her wand
[29114]4    Crucio
[29115]1008  'Neville screamed, his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground
[29116]730    The Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor, twitching and screaming in agony
[29117]809   That was just a taster
[29118]11099  ' said Bellatrix, raising her wand so that Neville's screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet
[29119]6090    She turned and gazed up at Harry
[29120]1502    Now, Potter, either give us the prophecy, or watch your little friend die the hard way
[29121]6984  'Harry did not have to think; there was no choice
[29122]571    The prophecy was hot with the heat of his clutching hand as he held it out
[29123]551    Malfoy jumped forwards to take it
[29124]2367   Then, high above them, two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room: Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks and Kingsley
[29125]2116   Malfoy turned, and raised his wand, but Tonks had already sent a Stunning Spell right at him
[29126]6892    Harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact, but dived off the dais out of the way
[29127]970    The Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step towards the sunken floor
[29128]6199    Through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, Harry could see Neville crawling along
[29129]765    He dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach Neville
[29130]82   Are you OK
[29131]265  ' he yelled, as another spell soared inches over their heads
[29132]5942   Yes,' said Neville, trying to pull himself up
[29133]2002   And Ron
[29134]18584  'I dink he's all righd-he was still fighding de brain when I lefd-' The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where Neville's hand had been only seconds before; both scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere, seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes were barely touching the floor
[29135]11359   Give it to me,' growled a voice in his ear, give me the prophecy-'The man was pressing so tightly on Harry's windpipe that he could not breathe
[29136]8393    Through watering eyes he saw Sirius duelling with a Death Eater some ten feet away; Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix-nobody seemed to realise that Harry was dying
[29137]17208    He turned his wand backwards towards the man's side, but had no breath to utter an incantation, and the man's free hand was groping towards the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy-'AARGH
[29138]12763  'Neville had come lunging out of nowhere; unable to articulate a spell, he had jabbed Hermione's wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eater's mask
[29139]5933    The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of pain
[29140]6309    Harry whirled around to face him and gasped:STUPEFY
[29141]5566  'The Death Eater keeled over backwards and his mask slipped off: it was Macnair, Buckbeak's would-be killer, one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot
[29142]40   Thanks
[29143]23236  ' Harry said to Neville, pulling him aside as Sirius and his Death Eater lurched past, duelling so fiercely that their wands were blurs; then Harry's foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped
[29144]6856    For a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy, but then he saw Moody's magical eye spinning away across the floor
[29145]7620   Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his long pale face twisted with glee
[29146]2   Tarantallegra
[29147]1698  ' he shouted, his wand pointing at Neville, whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap-dance, unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again
[29148]9208    Now, Potter-'He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, Protego
[29149]12993  'Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife; the force of it knocked him sideways and he fell over Neville's jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell
[29150]545   Dolohov raised his wand again
[29151]1303    Accio proph-'Sirius had hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his shoulder and sent him flying out of the way
[29152]10699    The prophecy had again flown to the tips of Harry's fingers but he had managed to cling on to it
[29153]10064    Now Sirius and Dolohov were duelling, their wands flashing like swords, sparks flying from their wand-tips-Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on Harry and Hermione
[29154]5823    Springing up, Harry yelled, Petrificus Totalus
[29155]5081  ' Once again, Dolohov's arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backwards, landing with a crash on his back
[29156]56   Nice one
[29157]11946  ' shouted Sirius, forcing Harry's head down as a pair of Stunning Spells flew towards them
[29158]1298    Now I want you to get out of-'They both ducked again; a jet of green light had narrowly missed Sirius
[29159]7385    Across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps, her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat and Bellatrix, triumphant, running back towards the fray
[29160]6181   Harry, take the prophecy, grab Neville and run
[29161]838  ' Sirius yelled, dashing to meet Bellatrix
[29162]18391    Harry did not see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across his field of vision, battling with the pockmarked and no longer masked Rookwood; another jet of green light flew over Harry's head as he launched himself towards Neville-Can you stand
[29163]10323  ' he bellowed in Neville's ear, as Neville's legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably
[29164]30071    Put your arm round my neck-'Neville did so- Harry heaved-Neville's legs were still lying in every direction, they would not support him, and then, out of nowhere, a man lunged at them: both fell backwards, Neville's legs waving wildly like an overturned beetle's, Harry with his left arm held up in the air to try to save the small glass ball from being smashed
[29165]585   The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter
[29166]17674  ' snarled Lucus Malfoy's voice in his ear, and Harry felt the tip of Malfoy's wand pressing hard between his ribs
[29167]0   No-get-off- me 
[29168]0   
[29169]0   
[29170]354    Neville-catch it
[29171]6496  'Harry flung the prophecy across the floor, Neville span himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest
[29172]7653    Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled, Impedimenta
[29173]445  'Malfoy was blasted off his back
[29174]7919    As Harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now duelling
[29175]7221    Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and Neville again, but before he could draw breath to strike, Lupin had jumped between them
[29176]5857   Harry, round up the others and GO
[29177]28946  'Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily on to the first tier of stone steps; Neville's legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight; Harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step-'A spell hit the stone bench at Harry's heel; it crumbled away and he fell back to the step below
[29178]679    Neville sank to the ground, his legs still jerking and thrashing, and he thrust the prophecy into his pocket
[29179]436   Come on
[29180]16061  ' said Harry desperately, hauling at Neville's robes
[29181]13464    Just try and push with your legs-'He gave another stupendous heave and Neville's robes tore all along the left seam-the small spun-glass ball dropped from his pocket and, before either of them could catch it, one of Neville's floundering feet kicked it: it flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them
[29182]1313    As both of them stared at the place where it had broken, appalled at what had happened, a pearly-white figure with hugely magnified eyes rose into the air, unnoticed by any but them
[29183]6381    Harry could see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could he hear
[29184]196    The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness
[29185]5843   Harry, I'b sorry
[29186]1045  ' cried Neville, his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder
[29187]9368    I'b so sorry, Harry, I didn'd bean do-'It doesn't matter
[29188]5867  ' Harry shouted
[29189]6033    Just try and stand, let's get out of-'Dubbledore
[29190]16801  ' said Neville, his sweaty face suddenly transported, staring over Harry's shoulder
[29191]0   What
[29192]2  'DUBBLEDORE
[29193]7004  'Harry turned to look where Neville was staring
[29194]2590    Directly above them, framed in the doorway from the Brain Room, stood Albus Dumbledore, his wand aloft, his face white and furious
[29195]6227    Harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body-they were saved
[29196]7195   Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry, who had no more thoughts of leaving
[29197]1377    Dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realised he was there and yelled to the others
[29198]1284    One of the Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite
[29199]6180    Dumbledore's spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line-Only one pair was still battling, apparently unaware of the new arrival
[29200]11825    Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix's jet of red light: he was laughing at her
[29201]619   Come on, you can do better than that
[29202]1092  ' he yelled, his voice echoing around the cavernous room
[29203]487   The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest
[29204]1346   The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened in shock
[29205]6242   Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so
[29206]1735    He was jumping down the steps again, pulling out his wand, as Dumbledore, too, turned towards the dais
[29207]941   It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall: his body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backwards through the ragged veil hanging from the arch
[29208]12900   Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his godfather's wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind, then fell back into place
[29209]12849   Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange's triumphant scream, but knew it meant nothing-Sirius had only just fallen through the archway, he would reappear from the other side any second 
[29210]0   
[29211]0   
[29212]1317   But Sirius did not reappear
[29213]647   SIRIUS
[29214]5811  ' Harry yelled
[29215]647    SIRIUS
[29216]605  'He had reached the floor, his breath coming in searing gasps
[29217]7225    Sirius must be just behind the curtain, he, Harry, would pull him back out 
[29218]0   
[29219]0   
[29220]6358   But as he reached the ground and sprinted towards the dais, Lupin grabbed Harry around the chest, holding him back
[29221]16210   There's nothing you can do, Harry-'Get him, save him, he's only just gone through
[29222]10526  '-it's too late, Harry
[29223]6436   'We can still reach him-' Harry struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go 
[29224]0   
[29225]0   
[29226]10482   There's nothing you can do, Harry

[29252]2492     He hasn't gone
[29253]5811  ' Harry yelled
[29254]1256   He did not believe it; he would not believe it; still he fought Lupin with every bit of strength he had
[29255]8355    Lupin did not understand; people hid behind that curtain; Harry had heard them whispering the first time he had entered the room
[29256]1486    Sirius was hiding, simply lurking out of sight-SIRIUS
[29257]34  ' he bellowed
[29258]647    SIRIUS
[29259]20040  'He can't come back, Harry,' said Lupin, his voice breaking as he struggled to contain Harry
[29260]8206    He can't come back, because he's d-HE-IS-NOT- DEAD
[29261]5779  ' roared Harry
[29262]647    SIRIUS
[29263]582  'There was movement going on around them, pointless bustling, the flashes of more spells
[29264]9728    To Harry it was meaningless noise, the deflected curses flying past them did not matter, nothing mattered except that Lupin should stop pretending that Sirius-who was standing feet from them behind that old curtain-was not going to emerge at any moment, shaking back his dark hair and eager to re-enter the battle
[29265]6278   Lupin dragged Harry away from the dais
[29266]7941    Harry still staring at the archway, was angry at Sirius now for keeping him waiting-But some part of him realised, even as he fought to break free from Lupin, that Sirius had never kept him waiting before 
[29267]0   
[29268]0   
[29269]6526    Sirius had risked everything, always, to see Harry to help him 
[29270]0   
[29271]0   
[29272]6979    if Sirius was not reappearing out of that archway when Harry was yelling for him as though his life depended on it, the only possible explanation was that he could not come back 
[29273]0   
[29274]0   
[29275]8751    that he really was-Dumbledore had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in the middle of the room, seemingly immobilised by invisible ropes; Mad-Eye Moody had crawled across the room to where Tonks lay, and was attempting to revive her; behind the dais there were still flashes of light, grunts and cries-Kingsley had run forward to continue Sirius's duel with Bellatrix
[29276]5732   Harry
[29277]6557  'Neville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where Harry stood
[29278]6122    Harry was no longer struggling against Lupin, who maintained a precautionary grip on his arm nevertheless
[29279]5732   Harry 
[29280]0   
[29281]0   
[29282]399    I'b really sorry 
[29283]0   
[29284]0   
[29285]5392   ' said Neville
[29286]111    His legs were still dancing uncontrollably
[29287]1177    Was dad man-was Sirius Black a-a friend of yours
[29288]5790  'Harry nodded
[29289]16121   Here,' said Lupin quietly, and pointing his wand at Neville's legs he said, Finite
[29290]5681   ' The spell was lifted: Neville's legs fell back to the floor and remained still
[29291]5485    Lupin's face was pale
[29292]10140    Let's-let's find the others
[29293]306    Where are they all, Neville
[29294]924  'Lupin turned away from the archway as he spoke
[29295]231    It sounded as though every word was causing him pain
[29296]5394   Dey're all back dere,' said Neville
[29297]11843    A brain addacked Ron bud I dink he's all righd-and Herbione's unconscious, bud we could feel a bulse-'There was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais
[29298]7722    Harry saw Kingsley hit the ground yelling in pain: Bellatrix Lestrange turned tail and ran as Dumbledore whipped around
[29299]5924    He aimed a spell at her but she deflected it; she was halfway up the steps now -Harry-no
[29300]11013  ' cried Lupin, but Harry had already ripped his arm from Lupin's slackened grip
[29301]681   SHE KILLED SIRIUS
[29302]5766  ' bellowed Harry
[29303]685    SHE KILLED HIM-I'LL KILL HER
[29304]1213  'And he was off, scrambling up the stone benches; people were shouting behind him but he did not care
[29305]5625    The hem of Bellatrix's robes whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the room where the brains were swimming 
[29306]0   
[29307]0   
[29308]162   She aimed a curse over her shoulder
[29309]218    The tank rose into the air and tipped
[29310]6590    Harry was deluged in the foul-smelling potion within: the brains slipped and slid over him and began spinning their long coloured tentacles, but he shouted, Wingardium Leviosa
[29311]219  ' and they flew off him up into the air
[29312]12355    Slipping and sliding, he ran on towards the door; he leapt over Luna, who was groaning on the floor, past Ginny, who said, Harry-what-
[29313]3798  ', past Ron, who giggled feebly, and Hermione, who was still unconscious
[29314]2708    He wrenched open the door into the circular black hall and saw Bellatrix disappearing through a door on the other side of the room; beyond her was the corridor leading back to the lifts
[29315]657   He ran, but she had slammed the door behind her and the walls were already rotating
[29316]216    Once more, he was surrounded by streaks of blue light from the whirling candelabra
[29317]4759   Where's the exit
[29318]335  ' he shouted desperately, as the wall rumbled to a halt again
[29319]5105    Where's the way out
[29320]639  'The room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask
[29321]1615    The door right behind him flew open and the corridor towards the lifts stretched ahead of him, torch-lit and empty
[29322]62    He ran 
[29323]0   
[29324]0   
[29325]709   He could hear a lift clattering ahead; he sprinted up the passageway, swung around the corner and slammed his fist on to the button to call a second lift
[29326]6356    It jangled and banged lower and lower; the grilles slid open and Harry dashed inside, now hammering the button marked Atrium'
[29327]289    The doors slid shut and he was rising 
[29328]0   
[29329]0   
[29330]1377   He forced his way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open and looked around
[29331]1292    Bellatrix was almost at the telephone lift at the other end of the hall, but she looked back as he sprinted towards her and aimed another spell at him
[29332]1556    He dodged behind the Fountain of Magical Brethren: the spell zoomed past him and hit the wrought-gold gates at the other end of the Atrium so that they rang like bells
[29333]47    There were no more footsteps
[29334]182    She had stopped running
[29335]80    He crouched behind the statues, listening
[29336]6893   Come out, come out, little Harry
[29337]761  ' she called in her mock baby voice, which echoed off the polished wooden floors
[29338]1103    What did you come after me for, then
[29339]500   I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin
[29340]0  'I am
[29341]16365  ' shouted Harry, and a score of ghostly Harry's seemed to chorus I am
[29342]0   I am
[29343]0   I am
[29344]445   all around the room
[29345]1   Aaaaaah 
[29346]0   
[29347]0   
[29348]1461    did you love him, little baby Potter
[29349]5911  'Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before; he flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed, Crucio
[29350]1862  'Bellatrix screamed: the spell had knocked her off her feet, but she did not writhe and shriek with pain as Neville had-she was already back on her feet, breathless, no longer laughing
[29351]5818    Harry dodged behind the golden fountain again
[29352]2113    Her counter-spell hit the head of the handsome wizard, which was blown off and landed twenty feet away, gouging long scratches into the wooden floor
[29353]246   Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy
[29354]79  ' she yelled
[29355]572    She had abandoned her baby voice now
[29356]875    You need to mean them, Potter
[29357]4378   You need to really want to cause pain-to enjoy it-righteous anger won't hurt me for long-I'll show you how it is done, shall I
[29358]6428   I'll give you a lesson-'Harry was edging around the fountain on the other side when she screamed, Crucio
[29359]10922  ' and he was forced to duck down again as the centaur's arm, holding its bow, span off and landed with a crash on the floor a short distance from the golden wizard's head
[29360]468   Potter, you cannot win against me
[29361]40  ' she cried
[29362]1187   He could hear her moving to the right, trying to get a clear shot of him
[29363]10852    He backed around the statue away from her, crouching behind the centaur's legs, his head level with the house-elf's
[29364]5157   I was and am the Dark Lord's most loyal servant
[29365]1761    I learned the Dark Arts from him, and I know spells of such power that you, pathetic little boy, can never hope to compete- 'Stupefy
[29366]5811  ' yelled Harry
[29367]1121    He had edged right around to where the goblin stood beaming up at the now headless wizard and taken aim at her back as she peered around the fountain
[29368]704    She reacted so fast he barely had time to duck
[29369]4   Protego
[29370]341  'The jet of red light, his own Stunning Spell, bounced back at him
[29371]11343    Harry scrambled back behind the fountain and one of the goblin's ears went flying across the room
[29372]1446   Potter, I'm going to give you one chance
[29373]188  ' shouted Bellatrix
[29374]175    Give me the prophecy-roll it out towards me now-and I may spare your life
[29375]5452  'Well, you're going to have to kill me, because it's gone
[29376]6652  ' Harry roared and, as he shouted it, pain seared across his forehead; his scar was on fire again, and he felt a surge of fury that was quite unconnected with his own rage
[29377]65    And he knows
[29378]15807  ' said Harry, with a mad laugh to match Bellatrix's own
[29379]5477    Your dear old mate Voldemort knows it's gone
[29380]5293   He's not going to be happy with you, is he
[29381]0  'What
[29382]231   What do you mean
[29383]1166  ' she cried, and for the first time there was fear in her voice
[29384]702   The prophecy smashed when I was trying to get Neville up the steps
[29385]1632   What do you think Voldemort'll say about that, then
[29386]115  'His scar seared and burned 
[29387]0   
[29388]0   
[29389]667    the pain of it was making his eyes stream 
[29390]0   
[29391]0   
[29392]10   LIAR
[29393]278  ' she shrieked, but he could hear the terror behind the anger now
[29394]1844    YOU'VE GOT IT, POTTER, AND YOU WILL GIVE IT TO ME
[29395]72   Accio prophecy
[29396]72   ACCIO PROPHECY
[29397]7140  'Harry laughed again because he knew it would incense her, the pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst
[29398]971    He waved his empty hand from behind the one-eared goblin and withdrew it quickly as she sent another jet of green light flying at him
[29399]0   Nothing there
[29400]135  ' he shouted
[29401]4    Nothing to summon
[29402]5726   It smashed and nobody heard what it said, tell your boss that
[29403]0  'No
[29404]36  ' she screamed
[29405]2544    It isn't true, you're lying
[29406]3347   MASTER, I TRIED, I TRIED-DO NOT PUNISH ME-'Don't waste your breath
[29407]6511  ' yelled Harry, his eyes screwed up against the pain in his scar, now more terrible than ever
[29408]2497    He can't hear you from here
[29409]2769  'Can't I, Potter
[29410]5845  ' said a high, cold voice
[29411]6382   Harry opened his eyes
[29412]1617   Tall, thin and black-hooded, his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt, his scarlet, slit-pupilled eyes staring 
[29413]0   
[29414]0   
[29415]7304    Lord Voldemort had appeared in the middle of the hall, his wand pointing at Harry who stood frozen, quite unable to move
[29416]93   So, you smashed my prophecy
[29417]11846  ' said Voldemort softly, staring at Harry with those pitiless red eyes
[29418]85    No, Bella, he is not lying 
[29419]0   
[29420]0   
[29421]801    I see the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind 
[29422]0   
[29423]0   
[29424]117    months of preparation, months of effort 
[29425]0   
[29426]0   
[29427]6765    and my Death Eaters have let Harry Potter thwart me again 
[29428]0   
[29429]0   
[29430]681   ' Master, I am sorry, I knew not, I was fighting the Animagus Black
[29431]5462  ' sobbed Bellatrix, flinging herself down at Voldemort's feet as he paced slowly nearer
[29432]6184    Master, you should know-'Be quiet, Bella,' said Voldemort dangerously
[29433]306    I shall deal with you in a moment
[29434]1263    Do you think I have entered the Ministry of Magic to hear your snivelling apologies
[29435]325  'But Master-he is here-he is below-'Voldemort paid no attention
[29436]5954   I have nothing more to say to you, Potter,' he said quietly
[29437]354    You have irked me too often, for too long
[29438]7    AVADA KEDAVRA
[29439]7055  'Harry had not even opened his mouth to resist; his mind was blank, his wand pointing uselessly at the floor
[29440]6636   But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its plinth to land with a crash on the floor between Harry and Voldemort
[29441]6096    The spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms to protect Harry
[29442]0   What-
[29443]450  ' cried Voldemort, staring around
[29444]839    And then he breathed, Dumbledore
[29445]6517  'Harry looked behind him, his heart pounding
[29446]1037    Dumbledore was standing in front of the golden gates
[29447]2387   Voldemort raised his wand and another jet of green light streaked at Dumbledore, who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak
[29448]864    Next second, he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his wand towards the remnants of the fountain
[29449]106    The other statues sprang to life
[29450]749    The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix, who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest, before it dived at her, pinning her to the floor
[29451]982    Meanwhile, the goblin and the house-elf scuttled towards the fireplaces set along the wall and the one-armed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool
[29452]7403    The headless statue thrust Harry backwards, away from the fight, as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both
[29453]6447   It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,' said Dumbledore calmly
[29454]1145    The Aurors are on their way-'By which time I shall be gone, and you will be dead
[29455]244  ' spat Voldemort
[29456]6082    He sent another killing curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security guard's desk, which burst into flame
[29457]9133   Dumbledore flicked his own wand: the force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his golden guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it
[29458]1144    The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gong-like note reverberated from it-an oddly chilling sound
[29459]904   You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore
[29460]894  ' called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield
[29461]1    Above such brutality, are you
[29462]7608  'We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,' Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk towards Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall
[29463]1309    Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit-'There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore
[29464]270  ' snarled Voldemort
[29465]6574   You are quite wrong,' said Dumbledore, still closing in upon Voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks
[29466]6741    Harry felt scared to see him walking along, undefended, shieldless; he wanted to cry out a warning, but his headless guard kept shunting him backwards towards the wall, blocking his every attempt to get out from behind it
[29467]886    Indeed, your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness-'Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield
[29468]3321    This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip
[29469]722    A long thin flame flew from the tip; it wrapped itself around Voldemort, shield and all
[29470]3266    For a moment, it seemed Dumbledore had won, but then the fiery rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold on Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore
[29471]3116   Voldemort vanished; the snake reared from the floor, ready to strike-There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood
[29472]457   Look out
[29473]5811  ' Harry yelled
[29474]8797   But even as he shouted, another jet of green light flew at Dumbledore from Voldemort's wand and the snake struck-Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak wide and swallowed the jet of green light whole: he burst into flame and fell to the floor, small, wrinkled and flightless
[29475]3962    At the same moment, Dumbledore brandished his wand in one long, fluid movement-the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; and the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass
[29476]1511   For a few seconds Voldemort was visible only as a dark, rippling, faceless figure, shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth, clearly struggling to throw off the suffocating mass-Then he was gone and the water fell with a crash back into its pool, slopping wildly over the sides, drenching the polished floor
[29477]42   MASTER
[29478]89  ' screamed Bellatrix
[29479]13235   Sure it was over, sure Voldemort had decided to flee, Harry made to run out from behind his statue guard, but Dumbledore bellowed: Stay where you are, Harry
[29480]1455  'For the first time, Dumbledore sounded frightened
[29481]38012    Harry could not see why: the hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing Bellatrix still trapped under the witch statue, and the baby phoenix Fawkes croaking feebly on the floor-'Then Harry's scar burst open and he knew he was dead: it was pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance-He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the creatures began: they were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no escape-And when the creature spoke, it used Harry's mouth, so that in his agony he felt his jaw move 
[29482]0   
[29483]0   
[29484]901   Kill me now, Dumbledore 
[29485]0   
[29486]0   
[29487]6188   'Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the creature use him again 
[29488]0   
[29489]0   
[29490]1202   If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy 
[29491]0   
[29492]0   
[29493]6644   'Let the pain stop, thought Harry

[29496]404    let him kill us 
[29497]0   
[29498]0

[29506]0   
[29507]0   
[29508]17847   And as Harry's heart filled with emotion, the creatures coils loosened, the pain was gone; Harry was lying face down on the floor, his glasses gone, shivering as though he lay upon ice, not wood 
[29509]0   
[29510]0   
[29511]316   And there were voices echoing through the hall, more voices than there should have been 
[29512]0   
[29513]0   
[29514]7080    Harry opened his eyes, saw his glasses lying by the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him, but which now lay flat on its back, cracked and immobile
[29515]6622    He put them on and raised his head a little to find Dumbledore's crooked nose inches from his own
[29516]6289   Are you all right, Harry
[29517]11779  'Yes,' said Harry, shaking so violently he could not hold his head up properly
[29518]11548    Yeah, I'm -where's Voldemort, where-who are all these-what's-'The Atrium was full of people; the floor was reflecting the emerald green flames that had burst into fire in all the fireplaces along one wall; and streams of witches and wizards were emerging from them
[29519]8710    As Dumbledore pulled him back to his feet, Harry saw the tiny gold statues of the house-elf and the goblin, leading a stunned-looking Cornelius Fudge forward
[29520]0   He was there
[29521]781  ' shouted a scarlet-robed man with a ponytail, who was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall, where Bellatrix had lain trapped only moments before
[29522]698    I saw him, Mr
[29523]1083    Fudge, I swear it was You-Know-Who, he grabbed a woman and Disapparated
[29524]1870  'I know, Williamson, I know, I saw him too
[29525]1273  ' gibbered Fudge, who was wearing pyjamas under his pinstriped cloak and was gasping as though he had just run miles
[29526]4788    Merlin's beard-here-here
[29527]432  - in the Ministry of Magic
[29528]2791  -great heavens above-it doesn't seem possible-my word-how can this be-
[29529]15901  'If you proceed downstairs into the Department of Mysteries, Cornelius,' said Dumbledore- apparently satisfied that Harry was all right, and walking forwards so that the newcomers realised he was there for the first time (a few of them raised their wands; others simply looked amazed; the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and Fudge jumped so much that his slipper-clad feet left the floor)-'you will find several escaped Death Eaters contained in the Death Chamber, bound by an Anti-Disapparation Jinx and awaiting your decision as to what to do with them
[29530]817   'Dumbledore
[29531]246  ' gasped Fudge, beside himself with amazement
[29532]1109    You-here-I-I-'He looked wildly around at the Aurors he had brought with him and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry, Seize him
[29533]166  'Cornelius, I am ready to fight your men-and win, again
[29534]6444  ' said Dumbledore in a thunderous voice
[29535]1322    But a few minutes ago you saw proof, with your own eyes, that I have been telling you the truth for a year
[29536]1240    Lord Voldemort has returned, you have been chasing the wrong man for twelve months, and it is time you listened to sense
[29537]4645  'I-don't-well -' blustered Fudge, looking around as though hoping somebody was going to tell him what to do
[29538]5762    When nobody did, he said, Very well-Dawlish

[29542]0   
[29543]1701    Dumbledore, you-you will need to tell me exactly-the Fountain of Magical Brethren-what happened
[29544]1002  ' he added in a kind of whimper, staring around at the floor, where the remains of the statues of the witch, wizard and centaur now lay scattered
[29545]11960   We can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts,' said Dumbledore
[29546]11925   Harry-Harry Potter
[29547]12208  'Fudge wheeled around and stared at Harry, who was still standing against the wall beside the fallen statue that had guarded him during Dumbledore and Voldemort's duel
[29548]0   He-here
[29549]11021  ' said Fudge, goggling at Harry
[29550]4750    Why-what's all this about
[29551]6865  ' I shall explain everything,' repeated Dumbledore, when Harry is back at school
[29552]6492   'He walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wizard's head lay on the floor
[29553]601    He pointed his wand at it and muttered, Portus
[29554]939   ' The head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the wooden floor for a few seconds, then became still once more
[29555]817   Now see here, Dumbledore
[29556]12562  ' said Fudge, as Dumbledore picked up the head and walked back to Harry carrying it
[29557]3139    You haven't got authorisation for that Portkey
[29558]5595   You can't do things like that right in front of the Minister for Magic, you-you-'His voice faltered as Dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over his half-moon spectacles
[29559]6913   You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hogwarts,' said Dumbledore
[29560]945    You will tell your Aurors to stop searching for my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that he can return to work
[29561]0    I will give you

[29566]0   
[29567]1819   'half an hour of my time tonight, in which I think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here
[29568]463    After that, I shall need to return to my school
[29569]835    If you need more help from me you are, of course, more than welcome to contact me at Hogwarts
[29570]105    Letters addressed to the Headmaster will find me
[29571]1568   'Fudge goggled worse than ever; his mouth was open and his round face grew pinker under his rumpled grey hair
[29572]1149   I-you-'Dumbledore turned his back on him
[29573]5741   Take this Portkey, Harry
[29574]7774   'He held out the golden head of the statue and Harry placed his hand on it, past caring what he did next or where he went

[29611]17157     Harry's feet hit solid ground; his knees buckled a little and the golden wizard's head fell with a resounding clunk to the floor
[29612]6805    He looked around and saw that he had arrived in Dumbledore's office
[29613]23   Everything seemed to have repaired itself during the Headmasters absence
[29614]330    The delicate silver instruments stood once more on the spindle-legged tables, puffing and whirring serenely
[29615]221    The portraits of the headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames, heads lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of the picture
[29616]6569    Harry looked through the window
[29617]238    There was a cool line of pale green along the horizon: dawn was approaching
[29618]206   The silence and the stillness, broken only by the occasional grunt or snuffle of a sleeping portrait, was unbearable to him
[29619]339    If his surroundings could have reflected the feelings inside him, the pictures would have been screaming in pain
[29620]1360    He walked around the quiet, beautiful office, breathing quickly, trying not to think
[29621]562    But he had to think 
[29622]0   
[29623]0   
[29624]29    there was no escape 
[29625]0   
[29626]0   
[29627]758   It was his fault Sirius had died; it was all his fault
[29628]28958    If he, Harry, had not been stupid enough to fall for Voldemort's trick, if he had not been so convinced that what he had seen in his dream was real, if he had only opened his mind to the possibility that Voldemort was, as Hermione had said, banking on Harry's love of playing the hero 
[29629]0   
[29630]0   
[29631]631   It was unbearable, he would not think about it, he could not stand it 
[29632]0   
[29633]0   
[29634]10621    there was a terrible hollow inside him he did not want to feel or examine, a dark hole where Sirius had been, where Sirius had vanished; he did not want to have to be alone with that great, silent space, he could not stand it-A picture behind him gave a particularly loud grunting snore, and a cool voice said, Ah

[29637]6193    Harry Potter 
[29638]0   
[29639]0   
[29640]6997   'Phineas Nigellus gave a long yawn, stretching his arms as he surveyed Harry out of shrewd, narrow eyes
[29641]193   And what brings you here in the early hours of the morning
[29642]5127  ' said Phineas eventually
[29643]321    This office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful Headmaster
[29644]895    Or has Dumbledore sent you here
[29645]3635   Oh, don't tell me 
[29646]0   
[29647]0   
[29648]244   ' He gave another shuddering yawn
[29649]553    Another message for my worthless great-great-grandson
[29650]5808  'Harry could not speak
[29651]8299    Phineas Nigellus did not know that Sirius was dead, but Harry could not tell him
[29652]518    To say it aloud would be to make it final, absolute, irretrievable
[29653]38   A few more of the portraits had stirred now
[29654]6233    Terror of being interrogated made Harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob
[29655]70   It would not turn
[29656]105    He was shut in
[29657]6647   I hope this means,' said the corpulent, red-nosed wizard who hung on the wall behind the Headmasters desk, that Dumbledore will soon be back among us
[29658]6064  ' Harry turned
[29659]414    The wizard was surveying him with great interest
[29660]5790    Harry nodded
[29661]53    He tugged again on the doorknob behind his back, but it remained immovable
[29662]5938   Oh good,' said the wizard
[29663]58    It has been very dull without him, very dull indeed
[29664]6645   'He settled himself on the throne-like chair on which he had been painted and smiled benignly upon Harry
[29665]6989   Dumbledore thinks very highly of you, as I am sure you know,' he said comfortably
[29666]654    Oh yes
[29667]261    Holds you in great esteem
[29668]11311   'The guilt filling the whole of Harry's chest like some monstrous, weighty parasite, now writhed and squirmed
[29669]5866    Harry could not stand this, he could not stand being himself any more 
[29670]0   
[29671]0   
[29672]1157    he had never felt more trapped inside his own head and body, never wished so intensely that he could be somebody, anybody else 
[29673]0   
[29674]0   
[29675]7400   The empty fireplace burst into emerald green flame, making Harry leap away from the door, staring at the man spinning inside the grate
[29676]5995    As Dumbledore's tall form unfolded itself from the fire, the wizards and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake, many of them giving cries of welcome
[29677]5989   Thank you,' said Dumbledore softly
[29678]8563   He did not look at Harry at first, but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew, from an inside pocket of his robes, the tiny, ugly, featherless Fawkes, whom he placed gently on the tray of soft ashes beneath the golden post where the full-grown Fawkes usually stood
[29679]18067   Well, Harry,' said Dumbledore, finally turning away from the baby bird, you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the night's events
[29680]6796   'Harry tried to say, Good,' but no sound came out
[29681]8687    It seemed to him that Dumbledore was reminding him of the amount of damage he had caused, and although Dumbledore was for once looking at him directly, and although his expression was kindly rather than accusatory, Harry could not bear to meet his eyes
[29682]6087   Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up,' said Dumbledore
[29683]1190    Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St
[29684]209    Mungos, but it seems she will make a full recovery
[29685]6022   'Harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet, which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler
[29686]8381    He was sure all the: portraits around the room were listening closely to every word Dumbledore spoke, wondering where Dumbledore and Harry had been, and why there had been injuries
[29687]12711   I know how you're feeling, Harry,' said Dumbledore very quietly
[29688]16036   No, you don't,' said Harry, and his voice was suddenly loud and strong; white-hot anger leapt inside him; Dumbledore knew nothing about his feelings
[29689]817   You see, Dumbledore
[29690]5148  ' said Phineas Nigellus slyly
[29691]321    Never try to understand the students
[29692]12    They hate it
[29693]10731    They would much rather be tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own-'That's enough, Phineas,' said Dumbledore
[29694]7170   Harry turned his back on Dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the window
[29695]191    He could see the Quidditch stadium in the distance
[29696]6849    Sirius had appeared there once, disguised as the shaggy black dog, so he could watch Harry play 
[29697]0   
[29698]0   
[29699]6656    he had probably come to see whether Harry was as good as James had been 
[29700]0

[29702]6088    Harry had never asked him 
[29703]0   
[29704]0   
[29705]17103   There is no shame in what you are feeling, Harry,' said Dumbledore's voice
[29706]12    On the contrary 
[29707]0   
[29708]0   
[29709]1039    the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength
[29710]7263   'Harry felt the white-hot anger lick his insides, blazing in the terrible emptiness, filling him with the desire to hurt Dumbledore for his calmness and his empty words
[29711]27   My greatest strength, is it
[29712]11846  ' said Harry, his voice shaking as he stared out at the Quidditch stadium, no longer seeing it
[29713]3147    You haven't got a clue 
[29714]0   
[29715]0   
[29716]3712    you don't know 
[29717]0   
[29718]0   
[29719]3712   'What don't I know
[29720]1204  ' asked Dumbledore calmly
[29721]0   It was too much
[29722]6190    Harry turned around, shaking with rage
[29723]4079   I don't want to talk about how I feel, all right
[29724]6592  'Harry, suffering like this proves you are still a man
[29725]3421   This pain is part of being human-'THEN-I-DON'T -WANT-TO-BE-HUMAN
[29726]6874  ' Harry roared, and he seized the delicate silver instrument from the spindle-legged table beside him and flung it across the room; it shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall
[29727]5838    Several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright, and the portrait of Armando Dippet said, Really
[29728]3018  'I DON'T CARE
[29729]5876  ' Harry yelled at them, snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace
[29730]6073    I'VE HAD ENOUGH, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I DON'T CARE ANY MORE-'He seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that, too
[29731]520    It broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in different directions
[29732]5980   You do care,' said Dumbledore
[29733]6078    He had not flinched or made a single move to stop Harry demolishing his office
[29734]102    His expression was calm, almost detached
[29735]445    You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it
[29736]2941   'I-DON'T
[29737]8882  ' Harry screamed, so loudly that he felt his throat might tear, and for a second he wanted to rush at Dumbledore and break him, too; shatter that calm old face, shake him, hurt him, make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside himself
[29738]6588   Oh, yes, you do,' said Dumbledore, still more calmly
[29739]479    You have now lost your mother, your father, and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known
[29740]294    Of course you care
[29741]3838   'YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL
[29742]5779  ' Harry roared
[29743]3229    YOU-STANDING THERE-YOU-'But words were no longer enough, smashing things was no more help; he wanted to run, he wanted to keep running and never look back, he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes staring at him, that hatefully calm old face
[29744]998    He turned on his heel and ran to the door, seized the doorknob again and wrenched at it
[29745]743   But the door would not open
[29746]6881   Harry turned back to Dumbledore
[29747]5406   Let me out,' he said
[29748]657    He was shaking from head to foot
[29749]5947   No,' said Dumbledore simply
[29750]194   For a few seconds they stared at each other
[29751]11138   Let me out,' Harry said again
[29752]870   No,' Dumbledore repeated
[29753]12187   If you don't- if you keep me in here-if you don't let me-'By all means continue destroying my possessions,' said Dumbledore serenely
[29754]10    I daresay I have too many
[29755]6299   'He walked around his desk and sat down behind it, watching Harry
[29756]17379   Let me out,' Harry said yet again, in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as Dumbledore's
[29757]6173   Not until I have had my say,' said Dumbledore
[29758]6130   Do you-do you think I want to-do you think I give a-I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO SAY
[29759]5779  ' Harry roared
[29760]5118    I don't want to hear anything you've got to say
[29761]5921  'You will,' said Dumbledore steadily
[29762]247    Because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be
[29763]1881    If you are to attack me, as I know you are close to doing, I would like to have thoroughly earned it
[29764]144   'What are you talking-
[29765]6705  'It is my fault that Sirius died,' said Dumbledore clearly
[29766]323    Or should I say, almost entirely my fault-I will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole
[29767]1143    Sirius was a brave, clever and energetic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger
[29768]195    Nevertheless, you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight
[29769]7975    If I had been open with you, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight
[29770]1083    And Sirius would not have had to come after you
[29771]38    That blame lies with me, and with me alone
[29772]6256   'Harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but was unaware of it
[29773]1150    He was gazing at Dumbledore, hardly breathing, listening yet barely understanding what he was hearing
[29774]5946   Please sit down,' said Dumbledore
[29775]153    It was not an order, it was a request
[29776]12657   Harry hesitated, then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood, and took the seat facing Dumbledore's desk
[29777]16729   Am I to understand,' said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harry's left, that my great-great-grandson-the last of the Blacks-is dead
[29778]6233  'Yes, Phineas,' said Dumbledore
[29779]8170   I don't believe it,' said Phineas brusquely
[29780]7872   Harry turned his head in time to see Phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in Grimmauld Place
[29781]1039    He would walk, perhaps, from portrait to portrait, calling for Sirius through the house 
[29782]0   
[29783]0   
[29784]11653   Harry, I owe you an explanation,' said Dumbledore
[29785]5077    An explanation of an old man's mistakes
[29786]34    For I see now that what I have done, and not done, with regard to you, bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age
[29787]857    Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels
[29788]289    But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young 
[29789]0   
[29790]0   
[29791]51    and I seem to have forgotten, lately 
[29792]0   
[29793]0   
[29794]242   'The sun was rising properly now; there was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colourless and bright
[29795]1320    The light fell upon Dumbledore, upon the silver of his eyebrows and beard, upon the lines gouged deeply into his lace
[29796]6850   I guessed, fifteen years ago,' said Dumbledore, when I saw the scar on your forehead, what it might mean
[29797]320    I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort
[29798]12588   'You've told me this before, Professor,' said Harry bluntly
[29799]756    He did not care about being rude
[29800]744    He did not care about anything very much any more
[29801]6202   Yes,' said Dumbledore apologetically
[29802]465    Yes, but you see-it is necessary to start with your scar
[29803]918    For it became apparent, shortly after you rejoined the magical world, that I was correct, and that your scar was giving you warnings when Voldemort was close to you, or else feeling powerful emotion
[29804]11601   'I know,' said Harry wearily
[29805]6353   And this ability of yours-to detect Voldemort's presence, even when he is disguised, and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused-has become more and more pronounced since Voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers
[29806]6428   'Harry did not bother to nod
[29807]278    He knew all of this already
[29808]6198   More recently,' said Dumbledore, I became concerned that Voldemort might realise that this connection between you exists
[29809]1418    Sure enough, there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence
[29810]893    I am speaking, of course, of the night when you witnessed the attack on Mr
[29811]636    Weasley
[29812]6918   'Yeah, Snape told me,' Harry muttered
[29813]7923   Professor Snape, Harry,' Dumbledore corrected him quietly
[29814]718    But did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you
[29815]739   Why I did not teach you Occlumency
[29816]724   Why I had not so much as looked at you for months
[29817]6408  'Harry looked up
[29818]1526    He could see now that Dumbledore looked sad and tired
[29819]6032   Yeah,' Harry mumbled
[29820]318    Yeah, I wondered
[29821]2124   'You see,' Dumbledore continued, I believed it could not be long before Voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind, to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and I was not eager to give him more incentives to do so
[29822]603    I was sure that if he realised that our relationship was-or had ever been-closer than that of headmaster and pupil, he would seize his chance to use you as a means to spy on me
[29823]111    I feared the uses to which he would put you, the possibility that he might try and possess you
[29824]7642    Harry, I believe I was right to think that Voldemort would have made use of you in such a way
[29825]1351    On those rare occasions when we had close contact, I thought I saw a shadow of him stir behind your eyes 
[29826]0   
[29827]0   
[29828]7127   'Harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him, ready to strike, in those moments when he and Dumbledore had made eye-contact
[29829]5050   Voldemort's aim in possessing you, as he demonstrated tonight, would not have been my destruction
[29830]0    It would have been yours
[29831]248    He hoped, when he possessed you briefly a short while ago, that I would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him
[29832]5975    So you see, I have been trying, in distancing myself from you, to protect you, Harry
[29833]5084    An old man s mistake 
[29834]0   
[29835]0   
[29836]60   'He sighed deeply
[29837]5867    Harry was letting the words wash over him
[29838]1803    He would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago, but now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that was the loss of Sirius; none of it mattered 
[29839]0   
[29840]0   
[29841]7435   Sirius told me you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley's attack
[29842]725    I knew at once that my worst fears were correct: Voldemort had realised he could use you
[29843]6613    In an attempt to arm you against Voldemort's assaults on your mind, I arranged Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape
[29844]29   'He paused
[29845]11980    Harry watched the sunlight, which was sliding slowly across the polished surface of Dumbledore's desk, illuminate a silver ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill
[29846]12202    Harry could tell that the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to Dumbledore's explanation; he could hear the occasional rustle of robes, the slight clearing of a throat
[29847]119    Phineas Nigellus had still not returned 
[29848]0   
[29849]0   
[29850]2732   Professor Snape discovered,' Dumbledore resumed, that you had been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for months
[29851]3310    Voldemort, of course, had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body; and as he dwelled on the door, so did you, though you did not know what it meant
[29852]1406   And then you saw Rookwood, who worked in the Department of Mysteries before his arrest, telling Voldemort what we had known all along-that the prophecies held in the Ministry of Magic are heavily protected
[29853]1151    Only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the shelves without suffering madness: in this case, either Voldemort himself would have to enter the Ministry of Magic, and risk revealing himself at last-or else you would have to take it for him
[29854]169    It became a matter of even greater urgency that you should master Occlumency
[29855]8547   'But I didn't,' muttered Harry
[29856]5706    He said it aloud to try and ease the dead weight of guilt inside him: a confession must surely relieve some of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart
[29857]48188    I didn't practise, I didn't bother, I could've stopped myself having those dreams, Hermione kept telling me to do it, if I had he'd never have been able to show me where to go, and-Sirius wouldn't-Sirius wouldn't-'Something was erupting inside Harry's head: a need to justify himself, to explain-I tried to check he'd really taken Sirius, I went to Umbridge's office, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire and he said Sirius wasn't there, he said he'd gone
[29858]6065  'Kreacher lied,' said Dumbledore calmly
[29859]76    You are not his master, he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself
[29860]562    Kreacher intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic
[29861]85   'He-he sent me on purpose
[29862]654  'Oh yes
[29863]248    Kreacher, I am afraid, has been serving more than one master for months
[29864]0   'How
[29865]10840  ' said Harry blankly
[29866]2749    He hasn't been out of Grimmauld Place for years
[29867]7036   'Kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas,' said Dumbledore, when Sirius, apparently, shouted at him to get out"
[29868]1426    He took Sirius at his word, and interpreted this as an order to leave the house
[29869]813    He went to the only Black family member for whom he had any respect left 
[29870]0   
[29871]0   
[29872]5596    Black's cousin Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius Malfoy
[29873]771   'How do you know all this
[29874]10818  ' Harry said
[29875]192    His heart was beating very fast
[29876]316    He felt sick
[29877]5185    He remembered worrying about Kreacher's odd absence over Christmas, remembered him turning up again in the attic 
[29878]0   
[29879]0   
[29880]6533   Kreacher told me last night,' said Dumbledore
[29881]2337    You see, when you gave Professor Snape that cryptic warning, he realised that you had had a vision of Sirius trapped in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries
[29882]1432    He, like you, attempted to contact Sirius at once
[29883]5827    I should explain that members of the Order of the Phoenix have more reliable methods of communicating than the fire in Dolores Umbridge's office
[29884]2171    Professor Snape found that Sirius was alive and safe in Grimmauld Place
[29885]8490   When, however, you did not return from your trip into the Forest with Dolores Umbridge, Professor Snape grew worried that you still believed Sirius to be a captive of Lord Voldemort's
[29886]218    He alerted certain Order members at once
[29887]1684   ' Dumbledore heaved a great sigh and continued, Alastor Moody, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Remus Lupin were at Headquarters when he made contact
[29888]21    All agreed to go to your aid at once
[29889]2778    Professor Snape requested that Sirius remain behind, as he needed somebody to remain at Headquarters to tell me what had happened, for I was due there at any moment
[29890]1367    In the meantime he, Professor Snape, intended to search the Forest for you
[29891]1593   But Sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you
[29892]361    He delegated to Kreacher the task of telling me what had happened
[29893]2164    And so it was that when I arrived in Grimmauld Place shortly after they had all left for the Ministry, it was the elf who told me-laughing fit to burst-where Sirius had gone
[29894]56   'He was laughing
[29895]11383  ' said Harry in a hollow voice
[29896]6557   Oh, yes,' said Dumbledore
[29897]250    You see, Kreacher was not able to betray us totally
[29898]10690    He is not Secret Keeper for the Order, he could not give the Malfoy's our whereabouts, or tell them any of the Order's confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal
[29899]1239    He was bound by the enchantments of his kind, which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master, Sirius
[29900]1793    But he gave Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort, yet must have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from repeating it
[29901]734   'Like what
[29902]10818  ' said Harry
[29903]7651   Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world was you,' said Dumbledore quietly
[29904]1698    Like the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother
[29905]7708    Voldemort knew already, of course, that Sirius was in the Order, and that you knew where he was-but Kreacher's information made him realise that the one person for whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was Sirius Black
[29906]10621   'Harry's lips were cold and numb
[29907]0   So 
[29908]0   
[29909]0   
[29910]1311    when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night 
[29911]0   
[29912]0   
[29913]12779   'The Malfoy's- undoubtedly on Voldemort's instructions-had told him he must find a way of keeping Sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of Sirius being tortured
[29914]1055    Then, if you decided to check whether Sirius was at home or not, Kreacher would be able to pretend he was not
[29915]1130    Kreacher injured Buckbeak the hippogriff yesterday, and, at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire, Sirius was upstairs tending to him
[29916]11016   'There seemed to be very little air in Harry's lungs; his breathing was quick and shallow
[29917]440   And Kreacher told you all this 
[29918]0   
[29919]0   
[29920]52    and laughed
[29921]16  ' he croaked
[29922]6951   He did not wish to tell me,' said Dumbledore
[29923]1580    But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I-persuaded him-to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of Mysteries
[29924]20479   'And,' whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees, and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him-'She was quite right, Harry,' said Dumbledore
[29925]1055    I warned Sirius when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our Headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect
[29926]487    I also told him that Kreacher could be dangerous to us
[29927]26647    I do not think Sirius took me very seriously, or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human's-'Don't you blame -don't you-talk-about Sirius like-' Harry's breath was constricted, he could not get the words out properly; but the rage that had subsided briefly flared in him again: he would not let Dumbledore criticise Sirius
[29928]16838    Kreacher's a lying-foul-he deserved-'Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards, Harry,' said Dumbledore
[29929]293    Yes, he is to be pitied
[29930]5040    His existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobby's
[29931]6499    He was forced to do Sirius's bidding, because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved, but he felt no true loyalty to him
[29932]15815    And whatever Kreacher's faults, it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher's lot easier-'DON'T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT
[29933]5811  ' Harry yelled
[29934]1922   He was on his feet again, furious, ready to fly at Dumbledore, who had plainly not understood Sirius at all, how brave he was, how much he had suffered 
[29935]0   
[29936]0   
[29937]480   What about Snape
[29938]5743  ' Harry spat
[29939]144    You're not talking about him, are you
[29940]21815   When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me as usual-'Harry you know Professor Snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge,' said Dumbledore steadily, but as I have explained, he informed the Order as soon as possible about what you had said
[29941]965    It was he who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the Forest
[29942]7358    It was he, too, who gave Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum when she was attempting to force you to tell her Sirius's whereabouts
[29943]7769   'Harry disregarded this; he felt a savage pleasure in blaming Snape, it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt, and he wanted to hear Dumbledore agree with him
[29944]9380   Snape-Snape g -goaded Sirius about staying in the house-he made out Sirius was a coward- 'Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him,' said Dumbledore
[29945]766   Snape stopped giving me Occlumency lessons
[29946]5769  ' Harry snarled
[29947]237    He threw me out of his office
[29948]5980  'I am aware of it,' said Dumbledore heavily
[29949]30588    I have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my presence-'Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him-' Harry remembered Ron's thoughts on the subject and plunged on -how do you know he wasn't trying to soften me up for Voldemort, make it easier for him to get inside my- 'I trust Severus Snape,' said Dumbledore simply
[29950]5265    But I forgot-another old man's mistake- that some wounds run too deep for the healing
[29951]1816    I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about your father-I was wrong
[29952]4832   ' But that's OK, is it
[29953]5988  ' yelled Harry, ignoring the scandalised faces and disapproving mutterings of the portraits on the walls
[29954]11043    It's OK for Snape to hate my dad, but it's not OK for Sirius to hate Kreacher
[29955]7347  'Sirius did not hate Kreacher,' said Dumbledore
[29956]42    He regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice
[29957]34    Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike 
[29958]0   
[29959]0   
[29960]412    the fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie
[29961]472    We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward
[29962]2010   'SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT, DID HE
[29963]5811  ' Harry yelled
[29964]2359   I did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it,' Dumbledore replied quietly
[29965]1100    Sirius was not a cruel man, he was kind to house-elves in general
[29966]1021    He had no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living reminder of the home Sirius had hated
[29967]956   'Yeah, he did hate it
[29968]12671  ' said Harry, his voice cracking, turning his back on Dumbledore and walking away
[29969]1911    The sun was bright inside the room now and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked, without realising what he was doing, without seeing the office at all
[29970]12476    You made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it, that's why he wanted to get out last night-'I was trying to keep Sirius alive,' said Dumbledore quietly
[29971]4013   People don't like being locked up
[29972]10875  ' Harry said furiously, rounding on him
[29973]3195    You did it to me all last summer-'Dumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his long-fingered hands
[29974]7378    Harry watched him, but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion, or sadness, or whatever it was from Dumbledore, did not soften him
[29975]1183    On the contrary, he felt even angrier that Dumbledore was showing signs of weakness
[29976]5998    He had no business being weak when Harry wanted to rage and storm at him
[29977]7035   Dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his half-moon glasses
[29978]12274   It is time,' he said, for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago, Harry
[29979]43    Please sit down
[29980]821    I am going to tell you everything
[29981]404    I ask only a little patience
[29982]889    You will have your chance to rage at me-to do whatever you like- when I have finished
[29983]133    I will not stop you
[29984]7064   'Harry glared at him for a moment, then flung himself back into the chair opposite Dumbledore and waited
[29985]19381   Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended
[29986]188    Well-not quite whole
[29987]10    You had suffered
[29988]5575    I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep
[29989]805    I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years
[29990]29   'He paused
[29991]10818    Harry said nothing
[29992]496   You might ask- and with good reason-why it had to be so
[29993]196    Why could some wizarding family not have taken you in
[29994]73   Many would have done so more than gladly, would have been honoured and delighted to raise you as a son
[29995]118   My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive
[29996]79    You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but I realised
[29997]638    Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters-and many of them are almost as terrible as he-were still at large, angry, desperate and violent
[29998]440    And I had to make my decision, too, with regard to the years ahead
[29999]1130    Did I believe that Voldemort was gone for ever
[30000]0   No
[30001]1169    I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure, too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you
[30002]5679   I knew that Voldemort's knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive
[30003]511    I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power
[30004]526   But I knew, too, where Voldemort was weak
[30005]12    And so I made my decision
[30006]317    You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated-to his cost
[30007]524    I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you
[30008]455    She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day
[30009]4949    I put my trust, therefore, in your mother's blood
[30010]42    I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative
[30011]13255   'She doesn't love me,' said Harry at once
[30012]3492    She doesn't give a damn-' But she took you,' Dumbledore cut across him
[30013]642    She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you
[30014]4953    Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you
[30015]8395   'I still don't- 'While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort
[30016]134    He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister
[30017]100    Her blood became your refuge
[30018]911    You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, whilst you are there he cannot hurt you
[30019]170    Your aunt knows this
[30020]390    I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her doorstep
[30021]553    She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years
[30022]10895   'Wait,' said Harry
[30023]342    Wait a moment
[30024]1243   'He sat up straighter in his chair, staring at Dumbledore
[30025]91   You sent that Howler
[30026]8242    You told her to remember-it was your voice-' I thought,' said Dumbledore, inclining his head slightly, that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you
[30027]244    I suspected the Dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son
[30028]11622   'It did,' said Harry quietly
[30029]161    Well-my uncle more than her
[30030]5573    He wanted to chuck me out, but after the Howler came she-she said I had to stay
[30031]16850   'He stared at the floor for a moment, then said, But what's this got to do with-'He could not say Sirius's name
[30032]1679   Five years ago, then,' continued Dumbledore, as though he had not paused in his story, you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well-nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy
[30033]485    You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances
[30034]201    Thus far, my plan was working well
[30035]0   And then 
[30036]0   
[30037]0   
[30038]789    well, you will remember the events of your first year at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do
[30039]1384    You rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you and sooner-much sooner-than I had anticipated, you found yourself face to face with Voldemort
[30040]10    You survived again
[30041]667    You did more
[30042]110    You delayed his return to full power and strength
[30043]4920    You fought a man's fight
[30044]0    I was 
[30045]0   
[30046]0   
[30047]271    prouder of you than I can say
[30048]5963   Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine,' said Dumbledore
[30049]301    An obvious flaw that I knew, even then, might be the undoing of it all
[30050]443    And yet, knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed, I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to ruin it
[30051]31    I alone could prevent this, so I alone must be strong
[30052]460    And here was my first test, as you lay in the hospital wing, weak from your struggle with Voldemort
[30053]13951   'I don't understand what you're saying,' said Harry
[30054]3734   Don't you remember asking me, as you lay in the hospital wing, why Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby
[30055]5790  'Harry nodded
[30056]384   Ought I to have told you then
[30057]11582  'Harry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing, but his heart was racing again
[30058]33   You do not see the flaw in the plan yet
[30059]0   No 
[30060]0   
[30061]0   
[30062]0    perhaps not
[30063]882    Well, as you know, I decided not to answer you
[30064]1136    Eleven, I told myself, was much too young to know
[30065]344    I had never intended to tell you when you were eleven
[30066]84    The knowledge would be too much at such a young age
[30067]85   I should have recognised the danger signs then
[30068]2117    I should have asked myself why I did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which I knew, one day, I must give a terrible answer
[30069]1478    I should have recognised that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day 
[30070]0   
[30071]0   
[30072]86    you were too young, much too young
[30073]657   And so we entered your second year at Hogwarts
[30074]257    And once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced; once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams
[30075]1302    You did not ask me again, however, why Voldemort had left that mark on you
[30076]746    We discussed your scar, oh yes 
[30077]0   
[30078]0   
[30079]368    we came very, very close to the subject
[30080]999    Why did I not tell you everything
[30081]274  Well, it seemed to me that twelve was, after all, hardly better than eleven to receive such information
[30082]895    I allowed you to leave my presence, bloodstained, exhausted but exhilarated, and if I felt a twinge of unease that I ought, perhaps, to have told you then, it was swiftly silenced
[30083]242    You were still so young, you see, and I could not find it in myself to spoil that night of triumph 
[30084]0   
[30085]0   
[30086]5732   Do you see, Harry
[30087]59   Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now
[30088]388   I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could avoid, that I must avoid
[30089]8900   'I don't-'I cared about you too much,' said Dumbledore simply
[30090]475    I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed
[30091]499    In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act
[30092]68   Is there a defence
[30093]704   I defy anyone who has watched you as I have-and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined-not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered
[30094]1239    What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy
[30095]270   I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands
[30096]256   We entered your third year
[30097]864    I watched from afar as you struggled to repel dementors, as you found Sirius, learned what he was and rescued him
[30098]861    Was I to tell you then, at the moment when you had triumphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the Ministry
[30099]98   But now, at the age of thirteen, my excuses were running out
[30100]53    Young you might be, but you had proved you were exceptional
[30101]5745    My conscience was uneasy, Harry
[30102]1344    I knew the time must come soon 
[30103]0   
[30104]0   
[30105]987   But you came out of the maze last year, having watched Cedric Diggory die, having escaped death so narrowly yourself 
[30106]0   
[30107]0   
[30108]1644    and I did not tell you, though I knew, now Voldemort had returned, I must do it soon
[30109]1770    And now, tonight, I know you have long been ready for the knowledge I have kept from you for so long, because you have proved that I should have placed the burden upon you before this
[30110]619    My only defence is this: I have watched you struggling under more burdens than any student who has ever passed through this school and I could not bring myself to add another-the greatest one of all
[30111]7324   'Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak
[30112]3029   I still don't understand
[30113]545   'Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth
[30114]1791    He knew the prophecy had been made, though he did not know its full contents
[30115]316    He set out to kill you when you were still a baby, believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy
[30116]170    He discovered, to his cost, that he was mistaken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired
[30117]662    And so, since his return to his body, and particularly since your extraordinary escape from him last year, he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its entirety
[30118]122    This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his return: the knowledge of how to destroy you
[30119]5791   'The sun had risen fully now: Dumbledore's office was bathed in it
[30120]7384    The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the baby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes
[30121]15683   The prophecy's smashed,' Harry said blankly
[30122]1177    I was pulling Neville up those benches in the- the room where the archway was, and I ripped his robes and it fell 
[30123]0   
[30124]0   
[30125]560   'The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the Department of Mysteries
[30126]277    But the prophecy was made to somebody, and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly
[30127]271   'Who heard it
[30128]6827  ' asked Harry, though he thought he knew the answer already
[30129]6570   I did,' said Dumbledore
[30130]6292    On a cold, wet night sixteen years ago, in a room above the bar at the Hog's Head inn
[30131]361    I had gone there to see an applicant for the post of Divination teacher, though it was against my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all
[30132]1092    The applicant, however, was the great-great-granddaughter of a very famous, very gifted Seer and I thought it common politeness to meet her
[30133]16    I was disappointed
[30134]27    It seemed to me that she had not a trace of the gift herself
[30135]1643    I told her, courteously I hope, that I did not think she would be suitable for the post
[30136]454    I turned to leave
[30137]13004   'Dumbledore got to his feet and walked past Harry to the black cabinet that stood beside Fawkes's perch
[30138]7202    He bent down, slid back a catch and took from inside it the shallow stone basin, carved with runes around the edges, in which Harry had seen his father tormenting Snape
[30139]1707    Dumbledore walked back to the desk, placed the Pensieve upon it, and raised his wand to his own temple
[30140]928    From it, he withdrew silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to the wand and deposited them into the basin
[30141]880    He sat back down behind his desk and watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment
[30142]606    Then, with a sigh, he raised his wand and prodded the silvery substance with its tip
[30143]1100   A figure rose out of it, draped in shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size behind her glasses, and she revolved slowly, her feet in the basin
[30144]7370    But when Sybill Trelawney spoke, it was not in her usual ethereal, mystic voice, but in the harsh, hoarse tones Harry had heard her use once before:The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches 
[30145]0   
[30146]0   
[30147]130    born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies 
[30148]0   
[30149]0   
[30150]924    and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not 
[30151]0   
[30152]0   
[30153]411    and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives 
[30154]0   
[30155]0   
[30156]536    the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies 
[30157]0   
[30158]0   
[30159]1176   'The slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished
[30160]255   The silence within the office was absolute
[30161]6682    Neither Dumbledore nor Harry nor any of the portraits made a sound
[30162]123    Even Fawkes had fallen silent
[30163]1568   Professor Dumbledore
[30164]12485  ' Harry said very quietly, for Dumbledore, still staring at the Pensieve, seemed completely lost in thought
[30165]0    It 
[30166]0   
[30167]0   
[30168]898    did that mean 
[30169]0   
[30170]0   
[30171]898    what did that mean
[30172]7385  'It meant,' said Dumbledore, that the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end of July, nearly sixteen years ago
[30173]529    This boy would be born to parents who had already defied Voldemort three times
[30174]6037   'Harry felt as though something was closing in on him
[30175]82    His breathing seemed difficult again
[30176]45   It means-me
[30177]1162  'Dumbledore surveyed him for a moment through his glasses
[30178]11152   The odd thing, Harry,' he said softly, is that it may not have meant you at all
[30179]6239    Sybill's prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys, both born at the end of July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix, both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times
[30180]217    One, of course, was you
[30181]342    The other was Neville Longbottom
[30182]0   'But then 
[30183]0   
[30184]0   
[30185]5118    but then, why was it my name on the prophecy and not Neville's
[30186]10982  'The official record was re-labelled after Voldemort's attack on you as a child,' said Dumbledore
[30187]1036    It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom Sybill was referring
[30188]0   'Then-it might not be me
[30189]10818  ' said Harry
[30190]7061   I am afraid,' said Dumbledore slowly, looking as though every word cost him a great effort, that there is no doubt that it is you
[30191]6296   'But you said- Neville was born at the end of July, too-and his mum and dad-'You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort 
[30192]0   
[30193]0   
[30194]255    Voldemort himself would mark him as his equal
[30195]6399   And so he did, Harry
[30196]320    He chose you, not Neville
[30197]368    He gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse
[30198]89   'But he might have chosen wrong
[30199]10818  ' said Harry
[30200]167    He might have marked the wrong person
[30201]6488  'He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him,' said Dumbledore
[30202]7203    And notice this, Harry: he chose, not the pure-blood (which, according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing) but the half-blood, like himself
[30203]7063    He saw himself in you before he had ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not kill you, as he intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have fitted you to escape him not once, but four times so far- something that neither your parents, nor Neville's parents, ever achieved
[30204]667   'Why did he do it, then
[30205]11214  ' said Harry, who felt numb and cold
[30206]861    Why did he try and kill me as a baby
[30207]12497   He should have waited to see whether Neville or I looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was then-'That might, indeed, have been the more practical course,' said Dumbledore, except that Voldemort's information about the prophecy was incomplete
[30208]5968    The Hog's Head inn, which Sybill chose for its cheapness, has long attracted, shall we say, a more interesting clientele than the Three Broomsticks
[30209]488    As you and your friends found out to your cost, and I to mine that night, it is a place where it is never safe to assume you are not being overheard
[30210]732    Of course, I had not dreamed, when I set out to meet Sybill Trelawney, that I would hear anything worth overhearing
[30211]877    My-our-one stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the prophecy and thrown from the building
[30212]271   'So he only heard -
[30213]719  'He heard only the beginning, the part foretelling the birth of a boy in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort
[30214]199    Consequently, he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you, and marking you as his equal
[30215]664    So Voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you, that it might be wise to wait, to learn more
[30216]4884    He did not know that you would have power the Dark Lord knows not-'But I don't
[30217]11362  ' said Harry, in a strangled voice
[30218]13355    I haven't any powers he hasn't got, I couldn't fight the way he did tonight, I can't possess people or-or kill them -'There is a room in the Department of Mysteries,' interrupted Dumbledore, that is kept locked at all times
[30219]322    It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than the forces of nature
[30220]46    It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there
[30221]788    It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all
[30222]987    That power took you to save Sirius tonight
[30223]432    That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests
[30224]471    In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind
[30225]122    It was your heart that saved you
[30226]6314   'Harry closed his eyes
[30227]1521    If he had not gone to save Sirius, Sirius would not have died 
[30228]0   
[30229]0   
[30230]7919    More to stave off the moment when he would have to think of Sirius again, Harry asked, without caring much about the answer, The end of the prophecy 
[30231]0   
[30232]0   
[30233]0    it was something about 
[30234]0

[30236]32    neither can live

[30239]0   '
[30240]0   
[30241]0   
[30242]5905    while the other survives,' said Dumbledore
[30243]12540   So,' said Harry, dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him, so does that mean that 
[30244]0   
[30245]0   
[30246]774    that one of us has got to kill the other one 
[30247]0   
[30248]0   
[30249]219    in the end
[30250]6195  'Yes,' said Dumbledore
[30251]974   For a long time, neither of them spoke
[30252]7169    Somewhere far beyond the office walls, Harry could hear the sound of voices, students heading down to the Great Hall for an early breakfast, perhaps
[30253]1774    It seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food, who laughed, who neither knew nor cared that Sirius Black was gone for ever
[30254]9007    Sirius seemed a million miles away already; even now a part of Harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil, he would have found Sirius looking back at him, greeting him, perhaps, with his laugh like a bark 
[30255]0   
[30256]0   
[30257]11780   I feel I owe you another explanation, Harry,' said Dumbledore hesitantly
[30258]118    You may, perhaps, have wondered why I never chose you as a prefect
[30259]2   I must confess 
[30260]0   
[30261]0   
[30262]388    that I rather thought 
[30263]0   
[30264]0   
[30265]494    you had enough responsibility to be going on with
[30266]13307   'Harry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down Dumbledore's face into his long silver beard

[30275]852     HE WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED RETURNSIn a brief statement on Friday night, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge confirmed that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has returned to this country and is once more active
[30276]7484   It is with great regret that I must confirm that the wizard styling himself Lord-well, you know who I mean-is alive and among us again, said Fudge, looking tired and flustered as he addressed reporters
[30277]5194    It is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the dementors of Azkaban, who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the Ministry's employ
[30278]448    We believe the dementors are currently taking direction from Lord- Thingy
[30279]34   We urge the magician population to remain vigilant
[30280]637    The Ministry is currently publishing guides to elementary home and personal defence which will be delivered free to all wizarding homes within the coming month
[30281]6029   The Minister's statement was met with dismay and alarm from the wizarding community, which as recently as last Wednesday was receiving Ministry assurances that there was no truth whatsoever in these persistent rumours that You-Know-Who is operating amongst us once more
[30282]1171   Details of the events that led to the Ministry turnaround are still hazy, though it is believed that He Who Must Not Be Named and a select band of followers (known as Death Eaters) gained entry to the Ministry of Magic itself on Thursday evening
[30283]1740   Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, reinstated member of the International Confederation of Wizards and reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, has so far been unavailable for comment
[30284]1370    He has insisted over the past year that You-Know-Who is not dead, as was widely hoped and believed, but is recruiting followers once more for afresh attempt to seize power
[30285]14132    Meanwhile, the Boy Who Lived-'There you are, Harry, I knew they'd drag you into it somehow,' said Hermione, looking over the top of the paper at him
[30286]109   They were in the hospital wing
[30287]14930    Harry was sitting on the end of Ron's bed and they were both listening to Hermione read the front page of the Sunday Prophet
[30288]10216   Ginny, whose ankle had been mended in a trice by Madam Pomfrey, was curled up at the foot of Hermione's bed; Neville, whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size and shape, was in a chair between the two beds; and Luna, who had dropped in to visit, clutching the latest edition of The Quibbler, was reading the magazine upside-down and apparently not taking in a word Hermione was saying
[30289]7307   He's the boy who lived again now, though, isn't he
[30290]7112  ' said Ron darkly
[30291]30    Not such a deluded show-off any more, eh
[30292]6641  'He helped himself to a handful of Chocolate Frogs from the immense pile on his bedside cabinet, threw a few to Harry, Ginny and Neville and ripped off the wrapper of his own with his teeth
[30293]4903    There were still deep welts on his forearms where the brain's tentacles had wrapped around him
[30294]442    According to Madam Pomfrey, thoughts could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else, though since she had started applying copious amounts of Dr
[30295]4765    Ubbly's Oblivious Unction there seemed to have been some improvement
[30296]12741   Yes, they're very complimentary about you now, Harry,' said Hermione, scanning down the article

[30300]68    perceived as unbalanced, yet never wavered in his story

[30306]8467   Hmmm,' she said, frowning, I notice they don't mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing and slandering in the Prophet 
[30307]0   
[30308]0   
[30309]541   'She winced slightly and put a hand to her ribs
[30310]6274    The curse Dolohov had used on her, though less effective than it would have been had he been able to say the incantation aloud, had nevertheless caused, in Madam Pomfrey's words, quite enough damage to be going on with'
[30311]2124    Hermione was having to take ten different types of potion every day, was improving greatly, and was already bored with the hospital wing

[30314]0   
[30315]11705   Well,' said Hermione, folding up the newspaper and throwing it aside, it's certainly given them lots to write about
[30316]13063    And that interview with Harry isn't exclusive, it's the one that was in The Quibbler months ago 
[30317]0   
[30318]0   
[30319]5428   ' Daddy sold it to them,' said Luna vaguely, turning a page of The Quibbler
[30320]1659   He got a very good price for it, too, so we're going to go on an expedition to Sweden this summer to see if we can catch a Crumple-Horned Snorkack
[30321]7023   'Hermione seemed to struggle with herself for a moment, then said, That sounds lovely
[30322]12288   'Ginny caught Harry's eye and looked away quickly, grinning
[30323]12588   So, anyway,' said Hermione, sitting up a little straighter and wincing again, what's going on in school
[30324]17228  'Well, Flitwick's got rid of Fred and George's swamp,' said Ginny, he did it in about three seconds
[30325]5284    But he left a tiny patch under the window and he's roped it off-'Why
[30326]7315  ' said Hermione, looking startled
[30327]7730   Oh, he just says it was a really good bit of magic,' said Ginny, shrugging
[30328]8758   I think he left it as a monument to Fred and George,' said Ron, through a mouthful of chocolate
[30329]7163    They sent me all these, you know,' he told Harry, pointing at the small mountain of Frogs beside him
[30330]832    Must be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh
[30331]8409  'Hermione looked rather disapproving and asked, So has all the trouble stopped now Dumbledore's back
[30332]11048  'Yes,' said Neville, everything's settled right back to normal
[30333]4924   'I s'pose Filch is happy, is he
[30334]3280  ' asked Ron, propping a Chocolate Frog Card featuring Dumbledore against his water jug
[30335]5422   Not at all,' said Ginny
[30336]5394    He's really, really miserable, actually

[30342]0   
[30343]676   'All six of them looked around
[30344]1762    Professor Umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them, gazing up at the ceiling
[30345]3436    Dumbledore had strode alone into the Forest to rescue her from the centaurs; how he had done it-how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him-nobody knew, and Umbridge was certainly not telling
[30346]712    Since she had returned to the castle she had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word
[30347]644    Nobody really knew what was wrong with her, either
[30348]464    Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were still bits of twigs and leaves in it, but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed
[30349]7555   Madam Pomfrey says she's just in shock,' whispered Hermione
[30350]6157   Sulking, more like,' said Ginny
[30351]7551   Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,' said Ron, and with his tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises
[30352]1361    Umbridge sat bolt upright, looking around wildly
[30353]829   Anything wrong, Professor
[30354]1431  ' called Madam Pomfrey, poking her head around her office door
[30355]0   No

[30366]11924   Speaking of centaurs,' said Hermione, when she had recovered a little, who's Divination teacher now
[30367]64   Is Firenze staying
[30368]18742  'He's got to,' said Harry, the other centaurs won't take him back, will they
[30369]6854  'It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach,' said Ginny
[30370]9827   Bet Dumbledore wishes he could've got rid of Trelawney for good,' said Ron, now munching on his fourteenth Frog
[30371]7801    Mind you, the whole subject's useless if you ask me, Firenze isn't a lot better 
[30372]0   
[30373]0   
[30374]270   'How can you say that
[30375]1644  ' Hermione demanded
[30376]1562    After we've just found out that there are real prophecies
[30377]10709  'Harry's heart began to race
[30378]4009    He had not told Ron, Hermione or anyone else what the prophecy had contained
[30379]12915    Neville had told them it had smashed while Harry was pulling him up the steps in the Death Room and Harry had not yet corrected this impression
[30380]778    He was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim, there was no other way 
[30381]0   
[30382]0   
[30383]7476   It is a pity it broke,' said Hermione quietly, shaking her head
[30384]7365   Yeah, it is,' said Ron
[30385]1260    Still, at least You-Know-Who never found out what was in it either- where are you going
[30386]6645  ' he added, looking both surprised and disappointed as Harry stood up
[30387]16341   Er-Hagrid's,' said Harry
[30388]3234    You know, he just got back and I promised I'd go down and see him and tell him how you two are
[30389]9007   'Oh, all right then,' said Ron grumpily, looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond
[30390]485    Wish we could come
[30391]306   'Say hello to him for us
[30392]7505  ' called Hermione, as Harry proceeded down the ward
[30393]4894    And ask him what's happening about 
[30394]0   
[30395]0   
[30396]350    about his little friend
[30397]6960  'Harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory
[30398]166   The castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday
[30399]648    Everybody was clearly out in the sunny grounds, enjoying the end of their exams and the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by revision or homework
[30400]7438    Harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor, peering out of windows as he went; he could see people messing around in the air over the Quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming in the lake, accompanied by the giant squid
[30401]1429   He was finding it hard to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not; whenever he was in company he wanted to get away and whenever he was alone he wanted company
[30402]2075    He thought he might really go and visit Hagrid, though, as he had not talked to him properly since he'd returned 
[30403]0   
[30404]0   
[30405]15337   Harry had just descended the last marble step into the Entrance Hall when Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle emerged from a door on the right that Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common room
[30406]7050    Harry stopped dead; so did Malfoy and the others
[30407]707    The only sounds were the shouts, laughter and splashes drifting into the Hall from the grounds through the open front doors
[30408]19287   Malfoy glanced around-Harry knew he was checking for signs of teachers-then he looked back at Harry and said in a low voice, You're dead, Potter
[30409]5899   'Harry raised his eyebrows
[30410]53   Funny
[30411]7069   ' he said, you'd think I'd have stopped walking around 
[30412]0   
[30413]0   
[30414]8213   'Malfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him; he felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale, pointed face contorted with rage
[30415]6701   You're going to pay,' said Malfoy, in a voice barely louder than a whisper
[30416]1940    I'm going to make you pay for what you've done to my father 
[30417]0   
[30418]0   
[30419]11296   'Well, I'm terrified now,' said Harry sarcastically
[30420]15535    I s'pose Lord Voldemort's just a warm-up act compared to you three-what's the matter
[30421]1471  ' he added, for Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name
[30422]7290    He's a mate of your dad, isn't he
[30423]32   Not scared of him, are you
[30424]6887  'You think you're such a big man, Potter,' said Malfoy, advancing now, Crabbe and Goyle flanking him
[30425]77    You wait
[30426]567    I'll have you
[30427]14428    You can't land my father in prison-'I thought I just had,' said Harry
[30428]6073   The dementors have left Azkaban,' said Malfoy quietly
[30429]1233    Dad and the others'll be out in no time 
[30430]0   
[30431]0   
[30432]11151   'Yeah, I expect they will,' said Harry
[30433]17809    Still, at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now-'Malfoy's hand flew towards his wand, but Harry was too quick for him; he had drawn his own wand before Malfoy's fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes
[30434]461   Potter
[30435]849  'The voice rang across the Entrance Hall
[30436]7885    Snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to his office and at the sight of him Harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt towards Malfoy 
[30437]0   
[30438]0   
[30439]6388    whatever Dumbledore said, he would never forgive Snape

[30442]0    never 
[30443]0   
[30444]0   
[30445]643   What are you doing, Potter
[30446]5644  ' said Snape, as coldly as ever, as he strode over to the four of them
[30447]12261   I'm trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,' said Harry fiercely
[30448]602   Snape stared at him
[30449]5851   Put that wand away at once,' he said curtly
[30450]1808    Ten points from Gryff-' Snape looked towards the giant hour-glasses on the walls and gave a sneering smile
[30451]51   Ah
[30452]1092    I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hour-glass to take away
[30453]584    In that case, Potter, we will simply have to-'Add some more
[30454]3550  'Professor McGonagall had just stumped up the stone, steps into the castle; she was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning heavily on a walking stick with her other, but otherwise looked quite well
[30455]1006   Professor McGonagall
[30456]5650  ' said Snape, striding forwards
[30457]40    Out of St
[30458]4785    Mungo's, I see
[30459]7615  'Yes, Professor Snape,' said Professor McGonagall
[30460]1225    shrugging off her travelling cloak, I'm quite as good as new
[30461]1537    You two-Crabbe-Goyle-' She beckoned them forwards imperiously and they came, shuffling their large feet and looking awkward
[30462]16073   Here,' said Professor McGonagall, thrusting her carpetbag into Crabbe's chest and her cloak into Goyle's, take these up to my office for me
[30463]764   'They turned and stumped away up the marble staircase
[30464]7392   Right then,' said Professor McGonagall, looking up at the hourglasses on the wall
[30465]2122    Well, I think Potter and his friends ought to have fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of You-Know-Who
[30466]1501   What say you, Professor Snape
[30467]0  'What
[30468]6847  ' snapped Snape, though Harry knew he had heard perfectly well
[30469]425    Oh-well-I suppose 
[30470]0   
[30471]0   
[30472]16871   'So that's fifty each for Potter, the two Weasleys, Longbottom and Miss Granger,' said Professor McGonagall, and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindor s hour-glass as she spoke
[30473]5745    Oh-and fifty for Miss Lovegood, I suppose,' she added, and a number of sapphires fell into Ravenclaw's glass
[30474]545    Now, you wanted to take ten from Mr
[30475]2254    Potter, I think, Professor Snape-so there we are 
[30476]0   
[30477]0   
[30478]98   'A few rubies retreated into the upper bulb, leaving a respectable amount below nevertheless
[30479]3668   Well, Potter, Malfoy, I think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this,' Professor McGonagall continued briskly
[30480]8646   Harry did not need telling twice; he thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at Snape and Malfoy
[30481]5783   The hot sun hit him with a blast as he walked across the lawns towards Hagrid's cabin
[30482]2442    Students lying around on the grass sunbathing, talking, reading the Sunday Prophet and eating sweets, looked up at him as he passed; some called out to him, or else waved, clearly eager to show that they, like the Prophet, had decided he was something of a hero
[30483]10818    Harry said nothing to any of them
[30484]1202    He had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days ago, but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred to keep it that way
[30485]6801   He thought at first when he knocked on Hagrid's cabin door that he was out, but then Fang came charging around the corner and almost bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome
[30486]699    Hagrid, it transpired, was picking runner beans in his back garden
[30487]5757   All righ', Harry
[30488]10887  ' he said, beaming, when Harry approached the fence
[30489]1603    Come in, come in, we'll have a cup o' dandelion juice

[30491]0   
[30492]4884   How's things

[30494]408    Yeh-er-feelin' all righ', are yeh
[30495]22887  ' Harry knew from the look of concern on Hagrid's face that he was not referring to Harry's physical well-being
[30496]17528   I'm fine,' Harry said quickly, because he could not bear to discuss the thing that he knew was in Hagrid's mind
[30497]693    So, where've you been
[30498]5790  'Bin hidin' out in the mountains,' said Hagrid
[30499]9827    Up in a cave, like Sirius did when he-'Hagrid broke off, cleared his throat gruffly, looked at Harry, and took a long draught of juice
[30500]5096   Anyway, back now,' he said feebly
[30501]12608   You-you look better,' said Harry, who was determined to keep the conversation moving away from Sirius
[30502]9   Wha
[30503]6840  ' said Hagrid, raising a massive hand and feeling his face
[30504]1001    Oh-oh yeah
[30505]4999    Well, Grawpy's loads better behaved now, loads
[30506]2103    Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back, ter tell yeh the truth

[30511]0   
[30512]0   
[30513]13049   'Harry would normally have tried to persuade Hagrid out of this idea at once; the prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the Forest, possibly even wilder and more brutal than Grawp, was positively alarming, but somehow Harry could not muster the energy necessary to argue the point
[30514]933    He was starting to wish he was alone again, and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large gulps of his dandelion juice, half-emptying his glass
[30515]12500   Ev'ryone knows yeh've bin tellin' the truth now, Harry' said Hagrid softly and unexpectedly
[30516]5930    He was watching Harry closely

[30527]1419   Hagrid bowed his great shaggy head
[30528]6581   Nah, I don' reckon he did,' he said quietly
[30529]5732    But still, Harry 
[30530]0   
[30531]0   
[30532]905    he was never one ter sit aroun' at home an' let other people do the fightin'

[30534]10221   I've got to go and visit Ron and Hermione in the hospital wing,' he said mechanically
[30535]6724   Oh,' said Hagrid, looking rather upset
[30536]362    Oh 
[30537]0   
[30538]0

[30549]0   
[30550]0   
[30551]8032   'Harry crossed to the door as fast as he could and pulled it open; he was out in the sunshine again before Hagrid had finished saying goodbye, and walking away across the lawn
[30552]546    Once again, people called out to him as he passed
[30553]1414    He closed his eyes for a few moments, wishing they would all vanish, that he could open his eyes and find himself alone in the grounds 
[30554]0   
[30555]0   
[30556]3129   A few days ago, before his exams had finished and he had seen the vision Voldemort had planted in his mind, he would have given almost anything for the wizarding world to know he had been telling the truth, for them to believe that Voldemort was back, and to know that he was neither a liar nor mad
[30557]0    Now, however 
[30558]0   
[30559]0   
[30560]1064   He walked a short way around the lake, sat down on its bank, sheltered from the gaze of passers-by behind a tangle of shrubs, and stared out over the gleaming water, thinking 
[30561]0   
[30562]0   
[30563]1478   Perhaps the reason he wanted to be alone was because he had felt isolated from everybody since his talk with Dumbledore
[30564]217    An invisible barrier separated him from the rest of the world
[30565]131    He was-he had always been-a marked man
[30566]1170    It was just that he had never really understood what that meant 
[30567]0   
[30568]0   
[30569]1495   And yet sitting here on the edge of the lake, with the terrible weight of grief dragging at him, with the loss of Sirius so raw and fresh inside, he could not muster any great sense of fear
[30570]1517    It was sunny, and the grounds around him were full of laughing people, and even though he felt as distant from them as though he belonged to a different race, it was still very hard to believe as he sat here that his life must include, or end in, murder 
[30571]0   
[30572]0   
[30573]3124   He sat there for a long time, gazing out at the water, trying not to think about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across from here, on the opposite bank, that Sirius had once collapsed trying to fend off a hundred dementors 
[30574]0   
[30575]0   
[30576]315   The sun had set before he realised he was cold
[30577]1614    He got up and returned to the castle, wiping his face on his sleeve as he went
[30578]4401   Ron and Hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before the end of term
[30579]5381    Hermione kept showing signs of wanting to talk about Sirius, but Ron tended to make hushing' noises every time she mentioned his name
[30580]6317    Harry was still not sure whether or not he wanted to talk about his godfather yet; his wishes varied with his mood
[30581]2097    He knew one thing, though: unhappy as he felt at the moment, he would greatly miss Hogwarts in a few days' time when he was back at number four, Privet Drive
[30582]1224    Even though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer, he did not feel any better about it
[30583]57    Indeed, he had never dreaded his return more
[30584]2256   Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term
[30585]1319    It seemed she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime, evidently hoping to depart undetected, but unfortunately for her, she met Peeves on the way, who seized his last chance to do as Fred had instructed, and chased her gleefully from the premises whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk
[30586]1386    Many students ran out into the Entrance Hall to watch her running away down the path and the Heads of Houses tried only half-heartedly to restrain them
[30587]2565    Indeed, Professor McGonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after Umbridge herself, because Peeves had borrowed her walking stick
[30588]6997   Their last evening at school arrived; most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the end-of-term leaving feast, but Harry had not even started
[30589]849   Just do it tomorrow
[30590]7721  ' said Ron, who was waiting by the door of their dormitory
[30591]884    Come on, I'm starving
[30592]2797   'I won't be long

[30595]510    look, you go ahead 
[30596]0   
[30597]0   
[30598]8432   'But when the dormitory door closed behind Ron, Harry made no effort to speed up his packing
[30599]460    The very last thing he wanted to do was to attend the Leaving Feast
[30600]1093    He was worried that Dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech
[30601]5497    He was sure to mention Voldemort's return; he had talked to them about it last year, after all

[30604]7716   Harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his trunk to make way for folded ones and, as he did so, noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it
[30605]744    He could not think what it was doing there
[30606]233    He bent down, pulled it out from underneath his trainers and examined it
[30607]122   He realised what it was within seconds
[30608]2520    Sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of number twelve Grimmauld Place
[30609]842    Use it if you need me, all right
[30610]5965  'Harry sank down on to his bed and unwrapped the package
[30611]343    Out fell a small, square mirror
[30612]927    It looked old; it was certainly dirty
[30613]7253    Harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him
[30614]362   He turned the mirror over
[30615]718    There on the reverse side was a scribbled note from Sirius
[30616]1827   This is a two-way mirror, I've got the other one of the pair
[30617]2762    If you need to speak to me, just say my name into it; you'll appear in my mirror and I'll be able to talk in yours
[30618]271    James and I used to use them when we were in separate detentions
[30619]10709   Harry's heart began to race
[30620]514    He remembered seeing his dead parents in the Mirror of Erised four years ago
[30621]3563    He was going to be able to talk to Sirius again, right now, he knew it-He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory was quite empty
[30622]7503    He looked back at the mirror, raised it in front of his face with trembling hands and said, loudly and clearly, Sirius
[30623]209   'His breath misted the surface of the glass
[30624]683    He held the mirror even closer, excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own
[30625]6631   He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly through the room:Sirius Black
[30626]143  'Nothing happened
[30627]1188    The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was still, definitely, his own 
[30628]0   
[30629]0   
[30630]20347   Sirius didn't have his mirror on him when he went through the archway, said a small voice in Harry's head
[30631]9534    That's why it's not working 
[30632]0   
[30633]0   
[30634]6333   Harry remained quite still for a moment, then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it shattered
[30635]1349    He had been convinced, for a whole, shining minute, that he was going to see Sirius, talk to him again 
[30636]0   
[30637]0   
[30638]1326   Disappointment was burning in his throat; he got up and began throwing his things pell-mell into the trunk on top of the broken mirror-But then an idea struck him 
[30639]0   
[30640]0   
[30641]324    a better idea than a mirror 
[30642]0   
[30643]0   
[30644]169    a much bigger, more important idea 
[30645]0   
[30646]0   
[30647]744    how had he never thought of it before-why had he never asked
[30648]2257  He was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase, hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing; he hurtled across the empty common room, through the portrait hole and off along the corridor, ignoring the Fat Lady, who called after him: The feast is about to start, you know, you're cutting it very fine
[30649]6252  'But Harry had no intention of going to the feast 
[30650]0   
[30651]0   
[30652]3088   How could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you didn't need one, yet now 
[30653]0   
[30654]0   
[30655]309   He ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead
[30656]529    They were all, clearly, in the Great Hall
[30657]1027    Outside his Charms classroom he came to a halt, panting and thinking disconsolately that he would have to wait until later, until after the end of the feast 
[30658]0   
[30659]0   
[30660]1682   But just as he had given up hope, he saw it-a translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor
[30661]133   Hey-hey, Nick
[30662]81   NICK
[30663]1450  'The ghost stuck its head back out of the wall, revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington
[30664]11630   Good evening,' he said, withdrawing the rest of his body from the solid stone and smiling at Harry
[30665]44    I am not the only one who is late, then
[30666]325   Though,' he sighed, in a rather different sense, of course 
[30667]0   
[30668]0   
[30669]191   'Nick, can I ask you something
[30670]6716  'A most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nick's face as he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little straighter, apparently to give himself thinking time
[30671]487    He desisted only when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely
[30672]5853   Er-now, Harry
[30673]5773  ' said Nick, looking discomfited
[30674]2414    Can't it wait until after the feast
[30675]11490  'No-Nick- please,' said Harry, I really need to talk to you
[30676]0    Can we go in here
[30677]6777  'Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Headless Nick sighed
[30678]6061   Oh, very well,' he said, looking resigned
[30679]4783    I can't pretend I haven't been expecting it
[30680]6782   'Harry was holding the door open for him, but he drifted through the wall instead
[30681]24   Expecting what
[30682]6688  ' Harry asked, as he closed the door
[30683]6435   You to come and find me,' said Nick, now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds
[30684]9    It happens, sometimes 
[30685]0   
[30686]0   
[30687]64    when somebody has suffered a 
[30688]0   
[30689]0   
[30690]10    loss
[30691]10828   'Well,' said Harry, refusing to be deflected
[30692]2379    You were right, I've-I've come to find you
[30693]5167   'Nick said nothing
[30694]21248   It's-' said Harry, who was finding this more awkward than he had anticipated, it's just- you're dead
[30695]2361    But you're still here, aren't you
[30696]273  ' Nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds
[30697]7716   That's right, isn't it
[30698]5738  ' Harry urged him
[30699]642    You died, but I'm talking to you 
[30700]0   
[30701]0   
[30702]2599    you can walk around Hogwarts and everything, can't you
[30703]6238  'Yes,' said Nearly Headless Nick quietly, I walk and talk, yes
[30704]2930   'So, you came back, didn't you
[30705]10841  ' said Harry urgently
[30706]1305    People can come back, right
[30707]14   As ghosts
[30708]3008    They don't have to disappear completely
[30709]0    Well
[30710]578  ' he added impatiently, when Nick continued to say nothing
[30711]5830   Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, Not everyone can come back as a ghost
[30712]852   'What d'you mean
[30713]10973  ' said Harry quickly
[30714]0   Only 
[30715]0   
[30716]0   
[30717]105    only wizards
[30718]11264   'Oh,' said Harry, and he almost laughed with relief
[30719]5530    Well, that's OK then, the person I'm asking about is a wizard
[30720]993    So he can come back, right
[30721]7329  'Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry
[30722]2880   He won't come back
[30723]0   'Who
[30724]6052  'Sirius Black,' said Nick
[30725]667   But you did
[30726]10901  ' said Harry angrily
[30727]8567    You came back-you're dead and you didn't disappear-'Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod,' said Nick miserably
[30728]144    But very few wizards choose that path
[30729]0   'Why not
[30730]10818  ' said Harry
[30731]12208    Anyway-it doesn't matter-Sirius won't care if it's unusual, he'll come back, I know he will
[30732]8910  'And so strong was his belief, Harry actually turned his head to check the door, sure, for a split second, that he was going to see Sirius, pearly-white and transparent but beaming, walking through it towards him
[30733]570   He will not come back,' repeated Nick
[30734]0    He will have 
[30735]0   
[30736]0   
[30737]129    gone on
[30738]981   'What d'you mean, gone on"
[30739]10973  ' said Harry quickly
[30740]129    Gone on where
[30741]105   Listen-what happens when you die, anyway
[30742]0   Where do you go
[30743]2853   Why doesn't everyone come back
[30744]2606   Why isn't this place full of ghosts
[30745]0   Why-
[30746]5240  'I cannot answer,' said Nick
[30747]2452   You're dead, aren't you
[30748]10821  ' said Harry exasperatedly
[30749]256    Who can answer better than you
[30750]5420  'I was afraid of death,' said Nick softly
[30751]37    I chose to remain behind
[30752]2340    I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn't to have 
[30753]0   
[30754]0   
[30755]0    well, that is neither here nor there 
[30756]0   
[30757]0   
[30758]81    in fact, I am neither here nor there 
[30759]0   
[30760]0   
[30761]390   ' He gave a small sad chuckle
[30762]6920    I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry, for I chose my feeble imitation of life instead
[30763]3696    I believe learned wizards study the matter in the Department of Mysteries-'Don't talk to me about that place
[30764]10837  ' said Harry fiercely
[30765]5433   I am sorry not to have been more help,' said Nick gently
[30766]0    Well 
[30767]0   
[30768]0   
[30769]22    well, do excuse me 
[30770]0   
[30771]0   
[30772]800    the feast, you know 
[30773]0   
[30774]0   
[30775]6857   'And he left the room, leaving Harry there alone, gazing blankly at the wall through which Nick had disappeared
[30776]6383   Harry felt almost as though he had lost his godfather all over again in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once more
[30777]600    He walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty castle, wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again
[30778]6002   He had turned the corner towards the Fat Lady's corridor when he saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall
[30779]355    A second glance showed him it was Luna
[30780]6902    There were no good hiding places nearby, she was bound to have heard his footsteps, and in any case, Harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment
[30781]5413   Hello,' said Luna vaguely, glancing around at him as she stepped back from the notice
[30782]465   How come you're not at the feast
[30783]6088  ' Harry asked
[30784]6000   Well, I've lost most of my possessions,' said Luna serenely
[30785]1099    People take them and hide them, you know
[30786]6170    But as it's the last night, I really do need them back, so I've been putting up signs
[30787]458   'She gestured towards the noticeboard, upon which, sure enough, she had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes, with a plea for their return
[30788]11891   An odd feeling rose in Harry; an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled him since Sirius's death
[30789]485    It was a few moments before he realised that he was feeling sorry for Luna
[30790]834   How come people hide your stuff
[30791]397  ' he asked her, frowning
[30792]362   Oh 
[30793]0   
[30794]0   
[30795]0    well 
[30796]0   
[30797]0   
[30798]17   ' she shrugged
[30799]2587    I think they think I'm a bit odd, you know
[30800]396    Some people call me Loony Lovegood, actually
[30801]6744   'Harry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully
[30802]10021   That's no reason for them to take your things,' he said flatly
[30803]1119    D'you want help finding them
[30804]5514  'Oh, no,' she said, smiling at him
[30805]1222    They'll come back, they always do in the end
[30806]1037    It was just that I wanted to pack tonight
[30807]0    Anyway 
[30808]0   
[30809]0   
[30810]2390    why aren't you at the feast
[30811]5749  'Harry shrugged
[30812]4376    Just didn't feel like it
[30813]5754   'No,' said Luna, observing him with those oddly misty, protuberant eyes
[30814]3004    I don't suppose you do
[30815]2875    That man the Death Eaters killed was your godfather, wasn't he
[30816]658   Ginny told me
[30817]7598   'Harry nodded curtly, but found that for some reason he did not mind Luna talking about Sirius
[30818]876    He had just remembered that she, too, could see Thestrals
[30819]0   Have you 
[30820]0   
[30821]0   
[30822]121   ' he began
[30823]231    I mean, who 
[30824]0   
[30825]0   
[30826]99    has anyone you known ever died
[30827]5652  ' Yes,' said Luna simply, my mother
[30828]2974    She was a quite extraordinary witch, you know, but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day
[30829]0    I was nine
[30830]6291   'I'm sorry,' Harry mumbled
[30831]5579   Yes, it was rather horrible,' said Luna conversationally
[30832]138    I still feel very sad about it sometimes
[30833]1493    But I've still got Dad
[30834]5396    And anyway, it's not as though I'll never see Mum again, is it
[30835]2530  'Er-isn't it
[30836]10835  ' said Harry uncertainly
[30837]563   She shook her head in disbelief
[30838]798   Oh, come on
[30839]3808    You heard them, just behind the veil, didn't you
[30840]231  'You mean 
[30841]0   
[30842]0   
[30843]464   'In that room with the archway
[30844]5672    They were just lurking out of sight, that's all
[30845]271    You heard them
[30846]676   'They looked at each other
[30847]374    Luna was smiling slightly
[30848]8309    Harry did not know what to say, or to think; Luna believed so many extraordinary things 
[30849]0   
[30850]0   
[30851]564    yet he had been sure he had heard voices behind the veil, too
[30852]4175   Are you sure you don't want me to help you look for your stuff
[30853]5086  ' he said
[30854]5592   Oh, no,' said Luna
[30855]2096    No, I think I'll just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up 
[30856]0   
[30857]0   
[30858]308    it always does in the end 
[30859]0   
[30860]0   
[30861]5799    well, have a nice holiday, Harry
[30862]277   'Yeah 
[30863]0   
[30864]0   
[30865]277    yeah, you too
[30866]876   'She walked away from him and, as he watched her go, he found that the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly
[30867]529   The journey home on the Hogwarts Express next day was eventful in several ways
[30868]7155    Firstly, Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle, who had clearly been waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses, attempted to ambush Harry halfway down the train as he made his way back from the toilet
[30869]12016    The attack might have succeeded had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the attack right outside a compartment full of DA members, who saw what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to Harry's aid
[30870]13791    By the time Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein and Terry Boot, had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry had taught them, Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniform as Harry, Ernie and Justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them there to ooze
[30871]17741   I must say, I'm looking forward to seeing Malfoy's mother's face when he gets off the train,' said Ernie, with some satisfaction, as he watched Malfoy squirm above him
[30872]1587    Ernie had never quite got over the indignity of Malfoy docking points from Hufflepuff during his brief spell as a member of the Inquisitorial Squad
[30873]13372   Goyle's mum'll be really pleased, though,' said Ron, who had come to investigate the source of the commotion
[30874]5567    He's loads better-looking now 
[30875]0   
[30876]0   
[30877]11789    anyway, Harry, the food trolley's just stopped if you want anything 
[30878]0   
[30879]0   
[30880]8087   ' Harry thanked the others and accompanied Ron back to their compartment, where he bought a large pile of cauldron cakes and pumpkin pasties
[30881]3252    Hermione was reading the Daily Prophet again, Ginny was doing a quiz in The Quibbler and Neville was stroking his Mimbulus mimbletonia, which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noises when touched
[30882]10102   Harry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while Hermione read out snippets from the Prophet
[30883]1653   It was now full of articles about how to repel dementors, attempts by the Ministry to track down Death Eaters and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very morning 
[30884]0   
[30885]0   
[30886]4451   It hasn't really started yet,' sighed Hermione gloomily, folding up the newspaper again
[30887]2797    But it won't be long now 
[30888]0   
[30889]0   
[30890]13294   'Hey, Harry,' said Ron softly, nodding towards the glass window on to the corridor
[30891]6408   Harry looked around
[30892]322    Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava
[30893]5709    His and Cho's eyes met for a moment
[30894]324    Cho blushed and kept walking
[30895]14565    Harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by Ron's knight
[30896]5360   What's-er- going on with you and her, anyway
[30897]2495  ' Ron asked quietly
[30898]10823   Nothing,' said Harry truthfully
[30899]12344   I-er-heard she's going out with someone else now,' said Hermione tentatively
[30900]6538   Harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all
[30901]7047    Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him; so much of what he had wanted before Sirius's death felt that way these days 
[30902]0   
[30903]0   
[30904]1632    the week that had elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, much longer; it stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in it, and the one without
[30905]7123   You're well out of it, mate,' said Ron forcefully
[30906]6662    I mean, she's quite good-looking and all that, but you want someone a bit more cheerful
[30907]15666   'She's probably cheerful enough with someone else,' said Harry, shrugging
[30908]4750   Who's she with now, anyway
[30909]4325  ' Ron asked Hermione, but it was Ginny who answered
[30910]5198   Michael Corner,' she said
[30911]7189   Michael-but- ' said Ron, craning around in his seat to state at her
[30912]489    But you were going out with him
[30913]5427  'Not any more,' said Ginny resolutely
[30914]5105    He didn't like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch, and got really sulky, so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead
[30915]941   ' She scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill, turned The Quibbler upside-down and began marking her answers
[30916]2728    Ron looked highly delighted
[30917]16369   Well, I always thought he was a bit of an idiot,' he said, prodding his queen forwards towards Harry's quivering castle
[30918]343    Good for you
[30919]1560    Just choose someone-better-next time
[30920]11325   'He cast Harry an oddly furtive look as he said it
[30921]5994   Well, I've chosen Dean Thomas, would you say he's better
[30922]718  ' asked Ginny vaguely
[30923]0   WHAT
[30924]2141  ' shouted Ron, upending the chessboard
[30925]458    Crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead
[30926]11277   As the train slowed down in the approach to King's Cross, Harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less
[30927]560    He even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off, but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would take him back to Hogwarts
[30928]5183    When it finally puffed to a standstill, however, he lifted down Hedwig's cage and prepared to drag his trunk from the train as usual
[30929]10161   When the ticket inspector signalled to Harry, Ron and Hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten, however, he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side: a group of people standing there to greet him who he had not expected at all
[30930]2572   There was Mad-Eye Moody, looking quite as sinister with his bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done without it, his gnarled hands clutching a long staff, his body wrapped in a voluminous travelling cloak
[30931]4204    Tonks stood just behind him, her bright bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass of the station ceiling, wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend The Weird Sisters
[30932]1400   Next to Tonks was Lupin, his face pale, his hair greying, a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers
[30933]576    At the front of the group stood Mr
[30934]369    and Mrs
[30935]1962    Weasley, dressed in their Muggle best, and Fred and George, who were both wearing brand-new jackets in some lurid green, scaly material
[30936]2338   Ron, Ginny
[30937]488  ' called Mrs
[30938]798    Weasley, hurrying forwards and hugging her children tightly
[30939]6184    Oh, and Harry dear-how are you
[30940]6023  'Fine,' lied Harry, as she pulled him into a tight embrace
[30941]2636    Over her shoulder he saw Ron goggling at the twins' new clothes
[30942]92   What are they supposed to be
[30943]459  ' he asked, pointing at the jackets
[30944]6171   Finest dragonskin, little bro',' said Fred, giving his zip a little tweak
[30945]1065    Business is booming and we thought we'd treat ourselves
[30946]11387   'Hello, Harry,' said Lupin, as Mrs
[30947]8639    Weasley let go of Harry and turned to greet Hermione
[30948]10844   Hi,' said Harry
[30949]2764    I didn't expect 
[30950]0   
[30951]0   
[30952]182    what are you all doing here
[30953]6419  'Well,' said Lupin with a slight smile, we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home
[30954]16066   'I dunno if that's a good idea,' said Harry at once
[30955]1389   Oh, I think it is,' growled Moody, who had limped a little closer
[30956]1028    That'll be them, will it, Potter
[30957]1103  'He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder; his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat
[30958]17894    Harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where Mad-Eye was pointing and there, sure enough, were the three Dursleys, who looked positively appalled to see Harry's reception committee
[30959]5783   Ah, Harry
[30960]5458  ' said Mr
[30961]9741    Weasley, turning from Hermione's parents, who he had just greeted enthusiastically, and who were now taking it in turns to hug Hermione
[30962]0    Well- shall we do it, then
[30963]5579  'Yeah, I reckon so, Arthur,' said Moody
[30964]372   He and Mr
[30965]1294    Weasley took the lead across the station towards the Dursleys, who were apparently rooted to the floor
[30966]1814    Hermione disengaged herself gently from her mother to join the group
[30967]5840   Good afternoon,' said Mr
[30968]1766    Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon as he came to a halt right in front of him
[30969]5557    You might remember me, my name's Arthur Weasley
[30970]372   ' As Mr
[30971]7515    Weasley had single-handedly demolished most of the Dursleys' living room two years previously, Harry would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten him
[30972]1302    Sure enough, Uncle Vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr
[30973]1000    Weasley, but chose not to say anything, partly, perhaps, because the Dursleys were outnumbered two to one
[30974]1439    Aunt Petunia looked both frightened and embarrassed; she kept glancing around, as though terrified somebody she knew would see her in such company
[30975]1007    Dudley, meanwhile, seemed to be trying to look small and insignificant, a feat at which he was failing extravagantly
[30976]13117   We thought we'd just have a few words with you about Harry,' said Mr
[30977]702    Weasley, still smiling
[30978]409   Yeah,' growled Moody
[30979]9692    About how he's treated when he's at your place
[30980]5073   ' Uncle Vernon's moustache seemed to bristle with indignation
[30981]532    Possibly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression that he was dealing with a kindred spirit, he addressed himself to Moody
[30982]598   I am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my house-' I expect what you're not aware of would fill several books, Dursley,' growled Moody
[30983]6508   Anyway, that's not the point,' interjected Tonks, whose pink hair seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together, for she closed her eyes rather than look at her
[30984]7819    The point is, if we find out you've been horrible to Harry- '-And make no mistake, we'll hear about it,' added Lupin pleasantly
[30985]16771   Yes,' said Mr Weasley, even if you won't let Harry use the felly-tone-' Telephone,' whispered Hermione
[30986]11681   -Yeah, if we get any hint that Potter's been mistreated in any way, you'll have us to answer to,' said Moody
[30987]330   Uncle Vernon swelled ominously
[30988]78    His sense of outrage seemed to outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddballs
[30989]156   Are you threatening me, sir
[30990]5625  ' he said, so loudly that passers-by actually turned to stare
[30991]6230   Yes, I am,' said Mad-Eye, who seemed rather pleased that Uncle Vernon had grasped this fact so quickly
[30992]1401   And do I look like the kind of man who can be intimidated
[30993]326  ' barked Uncle Vernon
[30994]0   Well 
[30995]0   
[30996]0   
[30997]5590   ' said Moody, pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his sinisterly revolving magical eye
[30998]476    Uncle Vernon leapt backwards in horror and collided painfully with a luggage trolley
[30999]1194    Yes, I'd have to say you do, Dursley
[31000]6721   'He turned away from Uncle Vernon to survey Harry
[31001]461   So, Potter 
[31002]0   
[31003]0   
[31004]200    give us a shout if you need us
[31005]3836    If we don't hear from you for three days in a row, we'll send someone along 
[31006]0   
[31007]0   
[31008]208   'Aunt Petunia whimpered piteously
[31009]942    It could not have been plainer that she was thinking of what the neighbours would say if they caught sight of these people marching up the garden path
[31010]16887   Bye, then, Potter,' said Moody, grasping Harry's shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand
[31011]11196   Take care, Harry,' said Lupin quietly
[31012]32    Keep in touch
[31013]7086   'Harry, we'll have you away from there as soon as we can,' Mrs
[31014]764    Weasley whispered, hugging him again
[31015]18719   We'll see you soon, mate,' said Ron anxiously, shaking Harry's hand
[31016]12804   Really soon, Harry,' said Hermione earnestly
[31017]20    We promise
[31018]5790   'Harry nodded
[31019]491    He somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to him, to see them all ranged there, on his side
[31020]2119    Instead, he smiled, raised a hand in farewell, turned around and led the way out of the station towards the sunlit street, with Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Dudley hurrying along in his wake
